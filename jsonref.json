They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.’The two pages were dated September 28, 1942, when Anne would have been 13, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex in a house in Amsterdam.She had covered the pages with brown paper fearing they might be found – and the contents of the entries had remained a mystery ever since.A reproduction of a picture of Anne Frank from 1941 released by the Anne Frank Fonds in Frankfurt Main, Germany (picture: PA)Anne herself described the four jokes about sex as ‘dirty’ and she had written an explanation of women’s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.On sex, Anne described how a young woman gets her period around age 14, saying that it is ‘a sign that she is ripe to have relations with a man but one doesn’t do that of course before one is married’.On prostitution, she wrote: ‘All men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In Paris they have big houses for that.She also wrote in Dutch about being asked to describe sex, saying: ‘I sometimes imagine that someone might come to me and ask me to inform him about sexual matters.‘How would I go about it?’She is said to have answered her own question, mentioning ‘rhythmical movements’ to describe sex and ‘internal medicament’ when talking about contraception.Experts said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne’s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.The house where Anne hid during the Second World War is now a museum in Amsterdam (Picture: Reuters)Mr Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.He said it provides an early example of how Anne ‘creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about’.The deciphering was done by researchers from the Anne Frank museum, the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the Huygens Institute of Netherlands History.They photographed the pages, backlit by a flash, and then used image-processing software to decipher the words, which were hard to read because they were jumbled up with the writing on the reverse sides of the pages.Anne and her family hid for more than two years during the Second World War, going into hiding in July 1942 until August 4 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne’s father, Otto Frank, survived the war. Anne and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp when Anne was 15."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12599779.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"tom hardy picks winner caught finger nose fonzo set","story":"Tom Hardy is a man for all seasons – but it’s nice to know he’s not averse to primal preening practices, either.The star, who is currently playing Al Capone in gangster flick Fonzo, was spotted in quite the position on set this week with his pointer firmly up his nostril.Just like Al, he was caught red handed!Frankly, it’s just nice to do another round of Celebrities: they’re just like us!Kitted out in the body makeup we’ve come to notice as he takes on the notorious don otherwise known as Scarface, while the star’s many, many tattoos were covered up in some hardcore makeup as he looked to be hanging out by his trailer.Look, when you’ve got to pick you’ve got to pick (Picture: MEGA)We guess that’s when the tickle upstairs beckoned.Look, when you’ve got to pick, you just can’t fight the urge sometimes.The guy needs a tissue – where are the assistants?!

I managed to grab his wrist and take the knife from him. I had to explain: \u0027Once you\u0027re dead, you don\u0027t come back. You\u0027re not invincible.\u0027But Riley is only just beginning to grasp the fact that actions have consequences and recognise the effects of his reckless behaviour.When Shelley caught him holding a lit match to the safety netting of their trampoline — with all four children sitting inside it — she showed him graphic pictures of burn victims.  Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strengthShelley says: \u0027I had to try to get him to understand the danger of fire, to show him exactly what would happen to him and his brother and sisters if he started fires.\u0027Shelley\u0027s partner Max adds: \u0027We adopt shock tactics. All the children have fallen down stairs because he has chased or pushed them. We\u0027re constantly rationalising: \u0027If you do that, they could break an arm, a leg, their neck. They could be killed.\u0027 \u0027Shelley and Max are also parents to Brooke, six, Skyla, four, and 20-month-old Mikey, who suffers from a reflux disorder, is fed through a tube and often spends time in hospital. The demands on the adults\u0027 time and attention are ceaseless.Riley, however, is not a monster — though he does behave monstrously at times — and he is not wilfully delinquent. For his behaviour is the result of the autism with which he was diagnosed a year ago.It accounts for his boisterousness, his attention-seeking, his outbursts of violence and frequent meltdowns. He also has a raft of other labels and conditions, from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to learning difficulties and oppositional defiant disorder (hostile, defiant and disobedient behaviour).Another condition, called sensory processing disorder, means that Riley\u0027s brain has difficulty responding to information that comes through his senses.\u0027He will cry if the seams of his socks aren\u0027t aligned properly,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, we can go through five pairs that don\u0027t feel right before he\u0027s happy to wear them.\u0027But he can also be sweet-natured and protective, kind and endearing.  Then and now: Riley has been a handful for his Hertfordshire parents but he knows he is different and already worries about his future\u0027He is a mass of contradictions,\u0027 says his mum. \u0027He\u0027ll be the first to climb on the shed roof or to the top of a tree. Once, he broke his collarbone falling off a wardrobe. He\u0027d climbed up it to get a pack of cards.\u0027He doesn\u0027t feel pain, either. The next day, with his arm in a sling, he was scaling the kitchen units.\u0027But, in some ways, he\u0027s mature about safety. He panics and is over-protective of his siblings. He worries that the girls might be bullied — he focuses on it obsessively.\u0027If we go to the station, he\u0027ll say: \u0027Hold the pushchair in case it gets sucked under a train.\u0027\u0027If I go above level one in the car park, he\u0027ll have a meltdown. He hates glass lifts, the noise of hand-dryers, and roller coasters.\u0027          Shelley has had to quit work to look after her son with autism. Now, they hope they can get a dog for him which will guide him through lifeMax adds: \u0027Yet he thinks he can fly and leap across ravines. And, although he throws punches at his sisters and kicks them in the face, he can also be caring.\u0027When Mikey had to go into hospital, he stroked his head so gently. He was crying. One to one, he can be the most wonderful, comical little boy.\u0027He has multiple personalities. Sometimes, he demands our constant, unided attention. At others, he retreats to his bedroom and wants to be alone.\u0027Woman takes fight to court as doctors try to remove autistic...Boy, 11, who was suspended for \u0027tapping his pen\u0027 hasn\u0027t been...Share this articleThe family\u0027s warm, but chaotic, home near St Albans, Hertfordshire, bears evidence of Riley\u0027s volatility. Doors have been removed as he has kicked holes through them. A sardonic sign in the sitting room reads: \u0027Remember: as far as anyone knows we are a nice, normal family.\u0027The Riley I meet bursts into the room after school, sweet-faced and charming, fizzing with energy and eager to chat about his day, from the roast lunch he ate in its entirety (\u0027except the fat bits on the meat\u0027) to the sponge pudding he didn\u0027t finish because he wanted to rush out and play with his friends.          Riley has kicked holes in doors and threatened to throw knives-  but his mum says he is not a monster as he tries to understand his conditionThere is little to distinguish him from other boys his age — his gelled hair and cheeky grin signal mischief — except that he wears the collar of his polo shirt tucked inside to stop his obsessive habit of chewing it and he grasps a small American football as if it were a priceless treasure. The ball is carried everywhere — he even takes it into the bath and to bed.This compulsive attachment to one object was an early indication to Shelley that Riley had traits that set him apart. As she works with young children, she was alert to his differences. At first, she remembers, he seemed precociously advanced.\u0027We\u0027d go somewhere and he\u0027d remember how to get back there from that single visit,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027And he spoke in complete sentences from 18 months. He was good at problem-solving, too: if he wanted to reach something, he\u0027d build a tower and climb up it.\u0027He was also endlessly, exhaustingly, active: somersaulting off the sofa or hanging off it upside down while watching his favourite wildlife programmes on television. He would absorb information like a sponge, constantly reciting facts.Shelley\u0027s relationship with Riley\u0027s father broke down when he was a baby but, when he was 16 months old, she met pub manager Max, who has raised her son with the same love and care he gives their other three children.          Riley has autism and, though a sweet-natured child, he has no sense of danger, nor awareness of his own strength. Pictured with Brooke age 6, Skyla age 4 and Mikey (20 months)Yet Riley\u0027s behaviour continued to tax and baffle them. It was, Shelley says, a \u0027supreme relief\u0027 when he was diagnosed, aged seven, with autism.It meant there was a reason for his quirks, his flare-ups, his failure to make eye contact and his adherence to ritual. Importantly, there were also ways to help him.But, although he now takes anti-psychotic medication, there are still times when Riley tries his parents\u0027 patience to its limits.One day, Max caught Riley with his hands round Brooke\u0027s neck. \u0027They were arguing because she\u0027d gone into his bedroom — his sanctuary — and Riley had grabbed her round the throat,\u0027 says Max.\u0027I was so angry and scared that I shouted to Shelley: \u0027Keep your son away from my children.\u0027 It\u0027s the first and only time I\u0027ve said it — I make a huge effort not to treat Riley differently from the others and, in my heart, he\u0027s my son — but I felt he\u0027d crossed a boundary and that Shelley wasn\u0027t doing enough to discipline him.\u0027However, conventional forms of chastisement do not work with Riley. He doesn\u0027t respond to sanctions, restraint or withdrawal of privileges.  Shelley with Mikey (20 months) and daughters Brooke age six, Skyla age four, as well as son Riley, aged eightThe pressures on the family are immense and relentless. For the past 18 months, neither Shelley nor Max has worked, as it is a full-time job for both of them to look after the children.\u0027I don\u0027t like Riley sometimes, but I never stop loving him,\u0027 says Shelley. And she fears for him, too. Her elder son is heart-breakingly self-aware, acutely conscious that his brain is differently wired from most people\u0027s — and it causes him intense pain.\u0027It makes me so sad,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027Sometimes, he\u0027ll say: \u0027I\u0027m an ugly, stupid boy,\u0027 and punch himself in the face and not seem to feel it.\u0027He gets upset about his behaviour and sobs. He says: \u0027Why do I have to have a brain like this?\u0027\u0027We\u0027ve always told him he has a \u0027special\u0027 brain. We\u0027ve built a story round it and told him not to be so hard on himself. We\u0027ve explained that he isn\u0027t \u0027bad\u0027. His brain just works differently.\u0027But Shelley worries about his future. Although he attends a mainstream junior school now, she knows he will need to go to a secondary school that caters for his special needs. What will happen in the future?She says: \u0027I have really down days sometimes, thinking: \u0027Is he going to cope? Where is his life leading? Will he ever have a relationship?\u0027\u0027My nan and granddad used to say: \u0027He\u0027ll grow out of it,\u0027 but, of course, he won\u0027t. Sometimes, he says he wishes he was dead — and that is the most painful thing for a mother to hear.\u0027Max adds: \u0027He says he doesn\u0027t know how to earn money or buy food and, even at his age, it worries him. Sometimes, he cries and says: \u0027What will I do when I\u0027m older?\u0027 But we tell him we\u0027ll always be here, that he can stay with us.\u0027          Riley once held his sister\u0027s head down in the bath and told his mum he was teaching her to breathe under waterOne glimmer of hope buoys them. When Shelley\u0027s sister, Jade, brought her border collie, Keiko, to stay with the family for a week, Riley was thrilled to be entrusted with the task of caring for the dog.\u0027His job was to get Keiko\u0027s food and water and he loved the procedure, the routine and the responsibility,\u0027 recalls Shelley.\u0027He precisely weighed out the food and he liked the fact that the dog gave him full-on attention.\u0027She loves chasing a ball — she never tires of it — and Riley spent hours outside throwing the ball for her to catch. He loved that she\u0027d sit when he asked her to and give him her paw. She slept on the floor in his bedroom and, all week, he didn\u0027t have a meltdown. It was as if the whole house gave a sigh of relief.\u0027\u0027That\u0027s what Riley needs. A dog,\u0027 Shelley said to Max after Keiko had gone back home.So she searched the internet and discovered Autism Life Dogs, a charity providing specially trained dogs for autistic people.          Shelley wants to try and raise enough money to buy a companion dog for her son who cries about being different to the other childrenSuch a dog costs £8,500, beyond the slender means of the family, so they are raising money for one.The dogs sense anxiety, hesitation, fear — all possible precursors to a meltdown — and signal before it happens. They are also wonderful companions.At present, Shelley and Max dare not let Riley out of their sight. \u0027He would run into the road chasing a ball without thinking about the traffic,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027And he wouldn\u0027t realise the danger of getting into a car with a stranger.\u0027With a dog at his side, however, he could take the first small steps towards independence. \u0027A dog wouldn\u0027t just change Riley\u0027s life,\u0027 says Shelley. \u0027It could save it, too.\u0027 Shelley\u0027s JustGiving page can be found here.Crowdfunding to Fund an Autism Life Dog for my son.

In Britain these schools included fee-paying ones as well as state schools outside council control.However, while the existence of such schools enhanced attainment, they also had a negative effect on pupil wellbeing. One in EIGHT secondary schools in England falls below...Grammar schools across the country add extra pupil places as...Share this articleThe researchers found that increased competition sharpened the focus on academic achievement – leading to the adoption of learning tools which, although academically effective, were not necessarily inspiring or enjoyable for their pupils.These learning tools include more traditional teaching, instructional time and homework, the research found.They also include more hierarchical pupil-teacher relations and increased pressure from parents.But the study said the positive effects on academic achievement appear to outweigh the negative impacts on pupil wellbeing. It comes amid a row over the role of grammars in Britain’s educational landscape.Mr Heller-Sahlgren said that although his study did not examine the effects of selective schools – many of which are academies – they were likely to add to the phenomenon he had described. ‘One could make the argument that it increases choice and competition in the same way,’ he said.‘If grammar schools promote more choice and competition, you could argue in a roundabout way that the results might be relevant for that as well.’The study, which was based on data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, was published in the Economics of Education Review.          Tee study said the positive effects on academic achievement appear to outweigh the negative impacts on pupil wellbeing (file picture)The findings are a boost for Conservative education policies. Since coming to power, the party has been encouraging all schools to leave council control – and failing schools have been forced to do so.Last week it emerged that thousands more places are to be created at selective schools. Education Secretary Damian Hinds has approved a £50million fund to build extra classrooms. However, grammars bidding for the money must be able to prove that they are taking action to increase admissions of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.It is thought that between 1,000 and 2,000 places could be created in areas where there is high demand from parents.The Department for Education said the move would give parents more choice and give more children of all backgrounds access to a good school place.But union leaders said ministers had no evidence that ‘shows strong educational benefit of this misguided policy’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/02/4C44AC5800000578-5734013-image-a-2_1526433058218.jpg","title":"Nature works magic time year wisteria blooms make purple envy","story":"    The climbing plant was already mature when the owners moved into the house near Wells, Somerset, 35 years ago          Wisteria growing on the Castle Hotel in Taunton, SomersetBut now the entire property is drenched in purple splendour, with this year’s display even more stunning than usual.

The owners of the £20,000 huts pay hundreds of pounds every year in ground rent to the local authority and are calling for the beach to be topped up with stones and pebbles\u0027The huts are now teetering on the edge of a mini cliff face. You literally cannot get into your hut unless you have a ladder.\u0027The drop outside my hut is between 8ft to 10ft and is very steep incline and every time you try and take a step you just drag more shingle down making the problem worse.\u0027It is impossible to sit outside. There are about 20 huts affected.\u0027We have asked the council to help by replenishing the bank and building a new sea wall but they have refused as it is too costly.\u0027Mrs Mead, a teaching assistant at a local primary school, said they had paid a specialist to lift her hut back a few feet and anchor it down.          Mrs Mead, a teaching assistant at a local primary school, said they had paid a specialist to lift her hut back a few feet and anchor it down. She is pictured with her father at their hutShe sad: \u0027We were concerned about the hut tumbling forward and hitting somebody.\u0027While the council are refusing to do anything to the beach, they made it clear that if anything like that happened it would be our responsibility.\u0027Sue Wearne, 54, has had her hut since last year. She said: \u0027We pay £460 a year to the council in ground rent, all we are asking for is there to be a bit of ground to sit on.\u0027Mike Race, who owns a hut a short distance up from those most seriously affected, said: \u0027The council are not helpful at all when it comes to this.\u0027They say it\u0027s a natural occurrence but the owners of those huts have been left very surprised and frustrated.          But officials at New Forest District Council say the loss of the shingle bank is a natural occurrence and are refusing to pay to replace it (pictured: the beach huts)\u0027They\u0027re very open to the elements and at risk down there but no one told them when they bought the huts that it could be this dangerous.\u0027A spokesman for New Forest District Council said that if the huts were unsafe to members of the public they would close off that part of the beach.He said: \u0027The beach has eroded following wave conditions during mid-April. The profile is natural in appearance.\u0027Further erosion is possible at any time, which could further undermine the huts causing a safety issue. If this did arise the council would intervene by closing any unsafe areas. It would then be the hut owners\u0027 responsibility for the timber buildings.\u0027The council does not undertake coastal protection works to protect beach huts. The council is not considering any works at this site.\u0027It is likely that the beach will naturally recover to some degree, but this may take time.\u0027An offer has been made to hut owners that material could be pulled up from the lower beach, when a suitable machine is next working at this site to do other work.\u0027Any other work would be very costly.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Adidas Pride Pack honor LGBT Pride Month","story":"The Meghan Markle effect explained ahead of the Royal WeddingAdidas Pride Pack to honor LGBT Pride MonthFreddie Mercury biopic: Bohemian Rhapsody trailer accused of straight-washing Queen frontmanArctic Monkeys announce Royal Albert Hall show for War Child charityUEFA to sponsor Rita Ora\u0027s tour for #WePlayStrong campaignWho was Tamara de Lempicka?

The father of the bride has been caught cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.  Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle, who doubled down on his idiocyPrince Harry’s own communications director sent out stern warnings to the media ordering them to back off Thomas Markle after seeing the photos and wrongly assuming he’d been the victim of a cruel invasion of privacy.In fact, Mr Markle was invading his own privacy – for a big fat cheque.Now, you might think he’d have learned his lesson, kept his head down and tried to rescue the last remnants of his dignity – if only for the sake of his poor daughter.And you would be wrong…Instead, Mr Markle’s doubled down on his idiocy.Since the Mail on Sunday exposed his cringe-making sham, he’s been sharing his thoughts on an almost hourly basis with TMZ – a fine showbiz website, but not previously noted for their expertise on the inner workings of British royalty. First, he told them was mortified by the embarrassment of the story.Then he claimed he’d had a heart attack last week, so wouldn’t be attending the wedding.Yesterday, Mr Markle was back with more exclusives he’d changed his mind and wanted to be at the ‘historic’ wedding.Then, last night, he told TMZ he now needed urgent heart surgery, so wouldn’t be able to go after all.TMZ, perfectly understandably, has splashed these juicy revelations across its site and generated huge clicks and attention for itself in the process.          Now Mr Markle has been sharing his thoughts with TMZ. They have understandably splashed these juicy revelations across the site and generated huge clicks and attention. Kudos to TMZ. But why is Thomas Markle continuing to collude with tabloid reporters - and what the hell is Kensington Palace playing at in letting him?As a former tabloid editor, I commend their brilliant news-breaking journalism. They’ve got the whole world waiting with baited breath for details of their next conversation with Meghan’s dad.But also as a former tabloid editor, I am utterly incredulous as to why Thomas Markle is continuing to collude with tabloid reporters?And I’m even more incredulous as to what the hell Kensington Palace is playing at in letting him?The Palace staff has completely and shamefully lost control of the narrative of this wedding.From the moment it was announced, they should have taken immediate steps to ensure Meghan’s family were protected from the inevitable massive media attention heading their way.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that when a handsome British Prince marries a beautiful American actress, global press interest is going to be off the charts.Yet Thomas Markle, currently the world’s most famous father-of-the-bride, has been left to fend for himself 8000 miles away.So he’s made his own decisions as to how to handle the media, aided and abetted by his ghastly daughter Samantha, and they have turned out disastrously.Why on earth didn’t Kensington Palace either send people to Mexico to advise him, or fly Mr Markle to London? It’s not as if Harry and Meghan can’t afford to put him up for a few weeks – they’re both rich and live in a giant palace full of spare rooms and servants.(Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that? And now won’t be able to at all before he makes the poor man’s daughter his wife.)          Why didn’t Kensington Palace send people to Mexico to advise him or fly Mr Markle to London? Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that?The result of this farcical incompetence is that Meghan’s had to spend the most stressful week of her life with a hundred times more stress than she could have ever imagined.I imagine she’s been utterly distraught at his father’s conduct.There have been reports of her tearfully begging him on the phone to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.What a terrible situation for any bride to find herself in.I also imagine that Harry’s been utterly furious.For someone who hates the paparazzi and tabloids to see his soon-to-be father-in-law in cahoots with the paparazzi and tabloids will have enraged the headstrong young Prince beyond belief.On the other hand he might reflect that if he and his big brother hadn’t been so controlling and privacy obsessed, constantly warning the press not to ‘intrude’ on Meghan’s family then Mr Markle’s collusion of said press would never have been so embarrassing. This will be his, and the Palace’s worst nightmare: a major player in the biggest day of his life going rogue.Perhaps things will sort themselves out by Saturday but I doubt it.From the sound of things, the only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum.          The only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum. She\u0027s seen here leaving for the airport, alone That fact alone would fill me with deep concern if I were the royals. Who ARE these Markles?What further mayhem are they going to wreak, especially now they’ve all been snubbed from the wedding?Hell, as we’ve already seen, hath no fury like an estranged relative scorned.I don’t think Harry and Meghan can escape some blame here.By excluding from their 600-strong guest-list all of Meghan’s family – many of whom have only said nice things about her and the wedding - and some of her oldest friends, they’re surely creating an even bigger problem down the road?Sometimes, a wedding is a good chance to settle old grievances, rather than cement them.They’re now going to have a lot more disgruntled Markles bristling with anger at being snubbed, especially when they see celebrities like the Beckhams sitting in ‘their’ seats in the church.So the Markle reality show will roll un-edifyingly on, and the Palace appears worryingly impotent and incompetent in its efforts to control the tidal wave of tacky titillation cascading from their lips.As for how all this washes up, my heart hopes Harry and Meghan will brush off the wedding chaos and live the fairy-tale happily ever after.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/22/4BDC9C4500000578-5692285-Victoria_Pendleton_right_almost_died_from_altitude_sickness_as_s-a-1_1525470177470.jpg","title":"TV star Ben Fogle conquers Mount Everest","story":"    Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds.

They include the Windrush generation, victims of torture, refugees and victims of sexual exploitation,\u0027 she said.\u0027Yarl\u0027s Wood in particular has caused so much pain to vulnerable women that we should have been protecting. Diverting these resources directly to them is not only essential, but the right thing to do.\u0027She added: \u0027This Government and its predecessors have long had an obsession with enriching the private sector from the public purse. \u0027This is despite the costs, either financially, in shoddy service or in human misery.\u0027Labour will end this rotten system. Private firms have no business in detention.\u0027Ms Abbott said Labour would return responsibility for those currently held in privately-run detention centres to local authorities and introduce a system of \u0027reporting and monitoring\u0027 for those subject to potential removal.The burden of proof in immigration cases would be shifted so that it was up to the Home Office to establish \u0027on the balance of probabilities\u0027 whether or not people were entitled to be in the UK before they could be removed.          Ms Abbott said the Windrush scandal was a \u0027direct consequence\u0027 of the approach championed by Theresa May (pictured at PMQs today) when she was home secretary          Instead of being held at sites like Brook House (pictured), Ms Abbott said thousands of people awaiting decisions on asylum and residency cases should be dealt with by a \u0027reporting and monitoring\u0027 systemShe said Labour would also restore \u0027proper rights of appeal\u0027 and was considering whether legal aid could be allowed in such cases.\u0027If we are going to deprive people of the right to be here, we must be clear that they do not have the right to live here,\u0027 Ms Abbott said.She added: \u0027If Labour under Jeremy Corbyn cannot begin the process of re-framing the debate on migration then I think Jeremy would feel he had failed.\u0027The announcement comes after new Home Secretary Sajid Javid disclosed on Tuesday that 63 members of the so-called \u0027Windrush generation\u0027, who came to the UK from the Commonwealth in the post-war decades, may have been wrongly removed or deported.Ms Abbott called on Mr Javid to make good a promise to restore full citizenship rights for all Commonwealth citizens who arrived before 1973.\u0027The Windrush scandal goes to the very heart of Theresa May\u0027s hostile environment policy - it was not accidental - it is a direct consequence of Government policy,\u0027 she said.\u0027Sajid Javid made a promise to make things right for the people who have been treated so appalling by his Government.\u0027He should start by restoring full rights of citizenship for all Commonwealth citizens, which his party removed and which has contributed to the tragedies that have fallen on the Windrush generation.\u0027Children that have been born here should not have to pay over £1,000 to obtain legal citizenship, simply because their parents were not born in this country. It is theirs as a right, just like it is my right and the right of most people in this room today.\u0027 Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said while the Government was committed to putting right the problems faced by members of the Windrush generation it needed to retain the powers of detention.\u0027Immigration detention is a vital tool in helping ensure those with no right to remain in the UK are returned to their home country,\u0027 she said.\u0027 And, if this led to the release of serious offenders this could put communities at risk,\u0027 she said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/14/4C44512900000578-5730961-image-a-2_1526390468591.jpg","title":"Windsor beefs security ahead royal wedding final preparations place","story":"    A police officer stands guard outside Windsor Castle as the Berkshire town prepares for the big dayWindsor will be placed on lock-down as early as Thursday when a dress rehearsal for the Royal wedding takes place.All roads on the procession route near Windsor Castle will be shut as the military, police and other emergency services prepare for the big day.As many as 100,000 visitors are expected to flock to the Berkshire town - which has a population of 35,000 - to see Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle on Saturday.The Royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead has warned people to set off at 4am because all nearby car parks are likely to be full by 6am.The wedding will be one of the most heavily guarded events in history, with police snipers perched on roof-tops, special-forces troops mingling with crowds and road blocks in place.A no-fly zone will also be in force during the service.To make sure the pomp and ceremony goes off without any problems, a run-through will take place on Thursday at 9am and travel along the same route around the 11th century castle.

The father of the bride has been caught cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.  Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle, who doubled down on his idiocyPrince Harry’s own communications director sent out stern warnings to the media ordering them to back off Thomas Markle after seeing the photos and wrongly assuming he’d been the victim of a cruel invasion of privacy.In fact, Mr Markle was invading his own privacy – for a big fat cheque.Now, you might think he’d have learned his lesson, kept his head down and tried to rescue the last remnants of his dignity – if only for the sake of his poor daughter.And you would be wrong…Instead, Mr Markle’s doubled down on his idiocy.Since the Mail on Sunday exposed his cringe-making sham, he’s been sharing his thoughts on an almost hourly basis with TMZ – a fine showbiz website, but not previously noted for their expertise on the inner workings of British royalty. First, he told them was mortified by the embarrassment of the story.Then he claimed he’d had a heart attack last week, so wouldn’t be attending the wedding.Yesterday, Mr Markle was back with more exclusives he’d changed his mind and wanted to be at the ‘historic’ wedding.Then, last night, he told TMZ he now needed urgent heart surgery, so wouldn’t be able to go after all.TMZ, perfectly understandably, has splashed these juicy revelations across its site and generated huge clicks and attention for itself in the process.          Now Mr Markle has been sharing his thoughts with TMZ. They have understandably splashed these juicy revelations across the site and generated huge clicks and attention. Kudos to TMZ. But why is Thomas Markle continuing to collude with tabloid reporters - and what the hell is Kensington Palace playing at in letting him?As a former tabloid editor, I commend their brilliant news-breaking journalism. They’ve got the whole world waiting with baited breath for details of their next conversation with Meghan’s dad.But also as a former tabloid editor, I am utterly incredulous as to why Thomas Markle is continuing to collude with tabloid reporters?And I’m even more incredulous as to what the hell Kensington Palace is playing at in letting him?The Palace staff has completely and shamefully lost control of the narrative of this wedding.From the moment it was announced, they should have taken immediate steps to ensure Meghan’s family were protected from the inevitable massive media attention heading their way.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that when a handsome British Prince marries a beautiful American actress, global press interest is going to be off the charts.Yet Thomas Markle, currently the world’s most famous father-of-the-bride, has been left to fend for himself 8000 miles away.So he’s made his own decisions as to how to handle the media, aided and abetted by his ghastly daughter Samantha, and they have turned out disastrously.Why on earth didn’t Kensington Palace either send people to Mexico to advise him, or fly Mr Markle to London? It’s not as if Harry and Meghan can’t afford to put him up for a few weeks – they’re both rich and live in a giant palace full of spare rooms and servants.(Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that? And now won’t be able to at all before he makes the poor man’s daughter his wife.)          Why didn’t Kensington Palace send people to Mexico to advise him or fly Mr Markle to London? Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that?The result of this farcical incompetence is that Meghan’s had to spend the most stressful week of her life with a hundred times more stress than she could have ever imagined.I imagine she’s been utterly distraught at his father’s conduct.There have been reports of her tearfully begging him on the phone to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.What a terrible situation for any bride to find herself in.I also imagine that Harry’s been utterly furious.For someone who hates the paparazzi and tabloids to see his soon-to-be father-in-law in cahoots with the paparazzi and tabloids will have enraged the headstrong young Prince beyond belief.On the other hand he might reflect that if he and his big brother hadn’t been so controlling and privacy obsessed, constantly warning the press not to ‘intrude’ on Meghan’s family then Mr Markle’s collusion of said press would never have been so embarrassing. This will be his, and the Palace’s worst nightmare: a major player in the biggest day of his life going rogue.Perhaps things will sort themselves out by Saturday but I doubt it.From the sound of things, the only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum.          The only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum. She\u0027s seen here leaving for the airport, alone That fact alone would fill me with deep concern if I were the royals. Who ARE these Markles?What further mayhem are they going to wreak, especially now they’ve all been snubbed from the wedding?Hell, as we’ve already seen, hath no fury like an estranged relative scorned.I don’t think Harry and Meghan can escape some blame here.By excluding from their 600-strong guest-list all of Meghan’s family – many of whom have only said nice things about her and the wedding - and some of her oldest friends, they’re surely creating an even bigger problem down the road?Sometimes, a wedding is a good chance to settle old grievances, rather than cement them.They’re now going to have a lot more disgruntled Markles bristling with anger at being snubbed, especially when they see celebrities like the Beckhams sitting in ‘their’ seats in the church.So the Markle reality show will roll un-edifyingly on, and the Palace appears worryingly impotent and incompetent in its efforts to control the tidal wave of tacky titillation cascading from their lips.As for how all this washes up, my heart hopes Harry and Meghan will brush off the wedding chaos and live the fairy-tale happily ever after.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/08/4C40978000000578-0-image-a-7_1526368527389.jpg","title":"Kensington cat burglar caught camera late night home raid","story":"Police want to talk to this man in connection with a series of burglaries in West LondonOne victim, who had a diamond engagement ring and a vintage watch belonging to her late mother stolen, has offered a reward of up to £40,000 for their return.In a statement released through the Metropolitan Police, the victim said: \u0027The fact that someone came into my house uninvited and rifled through my possessions is distressing.Dozens of neighbours chase down a suspected burglar \u0027like...Applause for the hero officers: MPs break rules to honour...Share this article\u0027The items which were stolen were of huge sentimental value as they belonged to my late mother.

Chinese authorities insist Liu “enjoys all freedoms in accordance with the law”, but supporters say her movements have been severely restricted and she lives under constant surveillance.Liu Xiaobo, who championed non-violent resistance as a way of overcoming “forceful tyranny” in China, died of liver cancer in 2017 at the age of 61 after spending almost a quarter of his life in prison.Last month, in a phone conversation with her friend the exiled writer Liao Yiwu, Liu said she herself was ready to die. “If I can’t leave, I’ll die in my home. Xiaobo is gone, and there’s nothing in the world for me now. It’s easier to die than live. Using death to defy could not be any simpler for me … If I’m dead, it’ll all be done with.” Liao posted a recording of the conversation online, on which Liu is heard crying for minutes at a time. Activists have repeatedly called for the release of Liu, who has never been accused or convicted of any crime. Now, big-name writers including Auster, Nobel laureate Coetzee, The Lovely Bones author Sebold, The Kite Runner author Hosseini, author Michael Chabon, Pulitzer-winning poet Rita Dove and the Chinese author Hu Ping have issued a public display of solidarity with the imprisoned writer.Reading excerpts from Liu’s poetry in a video made for Amnesty International, the authors are calling for the lifting of all restrictions on her movements. “Artists who are free to speak must do so on behalf of other artists whose voices are being stifled,” said Hosseini.PEN America’s chief executive Suzanne Nossel said the Chinese government’s claim that Liu “enjoys all freedoms in accordance with the law” was hollow.Amnesty International’s East Asia campaigns director Lisa Tassi called the Chinese government’s “efforts to silence” Liu “despicably cruel … Liu Xia’s poetry inspires so many who are now united in calling for her to be free.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc0e1b9ef3028f287509f419da82eb4db8b89c0b/0_69_5084_3050/master/5084.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aac71776b8290637ff7b2a0b0bec8128","title":"maggi hambling picked to create mary wollstonecraft statue","story":"Long-awaited memorial aims to capture spirit and strength of the ‘foremother of feminism’The pioneering British artist Maggi Hambling has been chosen for a long-awaited statue commemorating the “foremother of feminism” Mary Wollstonecraft.The Mary on the Green campaign, which has been calling for a permanent memorial to the philosopher and author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman since 2011, unanimously chose Hambling for the sculpture. Jude Kelly, patron for the campaign and artistic director of the Southbank Centre, called Hambling, who is best known for a sculpture of Oscar Wilde in Covent Garden, “a modern legend”. The winning statue design, which features a figure – described as an everywoman – emerging out of organic matter, is inspired by Wollstonecraft’s claim to be “the first of a new genus”. The plinth will feature her most famous quote: “I do not wish women to have power over men but over themselves.” It will be erected in Newington Green, north London, which is known as the birthplace of feminism because of Wollstonecraft’s roots there.Hambling said of the decision: “I’m really excited at the prospect of realising my idea, inspired by the trailblazer Mary Wollstonecraft. I hope the piece will act as a metaphor for the challenges women continue to face as we confront the world.”Anna Birch, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said Hambling had been chosen after a lengthy consultation and a rigorous judging process. She said: “There was a lot of debate but in the end it was unanimous. Given the artwork is by an international artist, I think it’s got the calibre to celebrate the contribution Wollstonecraft has made to philosophy and the emancipation of humankind.”Birch said Hambling’s Wollstonecraft piece would be “just as spirited” as Scallop, the artist’s controversial four-metre-high steel sculpture on Aldeburgh beach dedicated to Benjamin Britten.“We have gone for something metaphorical rather than a sculpture or portrait of her because we wanted to celebrate her spirit,” Birch said. “We’re not walking in the footsteps of the bronze male sculptures and what they do in Parliament Square. We wanted to do something different that will really attract passersby to look at it.” Hambling was also chosen because she is so passionate about Wollstonecraft’s legacy. “She doesn’t do anything that she doesn’t love. She is completely engrossed in who Wollstonecraft was and what her contribution was.”She added: “We know the artwork will spark a lot of discussion and attract a lot of people, which is what we really wanted.”Wollstonecraft, who died in 1797 and has been called the original suffragette, argued that women were capable of reason and all they lacked was education – which was considered an outrageous opinion at the time. She was also a prominent human rights campaigner, novelist and philosopher.More than 4,000 people have signed a petition in support of the memorial and the campaign has garnered support from the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and the London mayor Sadiq Khan.Birch said they hoped the sculpture would soon be made and erected although they currently need to raise approximately £60,000 more for the work to begin, for which a fundraising page has been set up.

Literally, I forgot entirely that they existed, which is one of the perils of a big chain … the left hand sometimes doesn’t know what the right hand is doing,” Daunt told the .“We will also need to work with them to ensure that we do not do anything predatory or anything that imperils them at all.”The U-turn was hailed as a “small victory” by Julie Danskin, the manager of Golden Hare Books, who said it was clear that the community had not responded well to the news.“We are very glad that James Daunt and Waterstones have done the decent thing. In future, though, one other thing that Waterstones can do is really dial down the discount offers on books because it does hit us in a way that does not need to happen.”Daunt said that the rollout of the unbranded stores – which began in 2014 with the opening of Southwold Books – would continue, although there would always be a clear role for its larger branches. The idea was to put “good people” in charge and encourage them to foster unbranded branches with a view to them evolving into “idiosyncratic, quirky little shops of the best sort”.“The key – and one of the things I have continued to struggle with at Waterstones – is how, within the context of a chain, you get the inidual booksellers to create a distinctive shop,” said Daunt, a former banker turned career bookseller who was brought in to rescue the chain in 2011 after a buyout by the Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut.“That is difficult and it’s about breaking a culture that has been trying for years to do something different.”The company, which was sold in April to US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, made its first profit in years last year – an achievement linked to a strategy of trying to run branches like local bookshops.Daunt, an opponent of Brexit, said that he also believed that Waterstones was very much “a force for good” in the current climate, adding: “These are times when we need bookshops, as things get spiky.”Gesturing down at the shop floor of the company’s London flagship in Piccadilly, he added that while its way of operating was different from branches in largely Brexit-voting towns such as Barrow-in-Furness, it was still important to keep outlets in such places.“We need to keep a shop there, and in Middlesbrough and Sunderland,” he added. “I am someone who finds Brexit an abomination and a betrayal of everything I stand for and I think that would be true of those who work in our shops.

A basic requirement of being the nation’s senior central banker is an ability to avoid making crassly sexist remarks. Ben Broadbent, one of four deputy governors and thus an internal candidate for the big job, has just failed the test after describing the UK economy as “menopausal”.Broadbent’s imagery, apart from being offensive, was also strange. In his interview with the Daily , he was trying to describe a period between important technological developments. The idea is that, just as there was a slowdown in growth in the 19th century after the invention of the steam engine but before the arrival of electricity, the UK economy has felt the benefits of the internet revolution and now awaits the next big thing, with artificial intelligence being a possibility.This phenomenon could be described by using any number of easy-to-understand comparisons. Waiting for the next tube train? Something like that. But menopausal? It doesn’t work, even if one is deaf to the offence caused by the implication that the menopause equates to a loss of productivity.They take public communication and reputation seriously at the Bank of England these days, as they should. One strand in governor Mark Carney’s “One Mission One Bank” modernisation programme is to open the doors of Threadneedle Street to counter the caricature of policy wonks inhabiting a world of their own. Another is to ensure more women occupy senior roles since the Bank compares poorly to the civil service on that measure. Broadbent’s comment, to put it mildly, won’t help either effort.He’s apologised quickly and straightforwardly, so his job is almost certainly safe. But the fact remains that any serious candidate for the governor of the Bank has to be trusted to conduct a newspaper interview safely. Remember, they practise for these occasions.Carney, who will depart at the end of June next year, currently stands accused of baffling everybody by giving mixed messages about the timing of rises in interest rates. But he’s never had to apologise for causing offence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0713b6f7fea974b28b6462fe94de82a38c872815/971_872_3925_2355/master/3925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=144e6ca6d7ac46d61c4999496e7f8140","title":"welcome cycle heaven moved family netherlands houten utrecht","story":"When Kylie van Dam went in search of a cycle-friendly city she found the almost car-free suburb of Houten. It’s a model more cities could copy, she writesBefore I’m out of bed, our 15-year-old slams the door and jumps on her bike, heading for school and meeting friends along the way.Last week, our eight and 13-year-olds attended four parties between them. They scoffed the obligatory birthday sugar, went bowling, shot lasers, played mini-golf and patted sheep – travelling to and from all of these activities by bike. There wasn’t a helmet or scrap of hi-vis between them. This is daily life in Houten, a suburb of Utrecht in the Netherlands. Spend any time here and you’ll soon see hordes of kids riding their bikes to gym lessons, parties, after-school care or sports activities through wind, rain or shine. One of my favourite Dutch expressions is “Jij bent niet van suiker gemaakt” (“You’re not made of sugar”), meaning you won’t dissolve in the rain – so get on your bike.This lifestyle drew us to the Netherlands from Britain. After 15 years of dreaming – via Sydney, London and Norwich – we went in search of a more cycle-friendly city.Now we’re Houtenaars, citizens of a world-renowned cycling suburb studied by future town planners around the globe. Houten has been on the map since Roman times, but modern development began in the late 1960s as an overspill for fast-growing Utrecht.Architect Rob Derks designed Houten to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists over motorists. A ring road circles the suburb, and residential districts within are only accessible to cars through these roads on the edge of town. Instead, there is an extensive network of paths and cycle lanes connecting these areas. Sharp bends and low speed limits mean roads are intentionally difficult to navigate by motor vehicle: in Houten, cars are slightly unwelcome guests. Unlike drivers, cyclists and walkers can travel direct, making a two-minute walk or ride a 10-minute trip by car, for example.Residents do own cars – although rarely more than one, and some prefer to use a car-share company. Children ride bikes as soon as they can walk, people with disabilities move freely and independently, elderly people cycle everywhere and if they start to feel unsafe on two wheels, they swap them for three. Immigrants who’ve never had a bicycle are taught to ride.Every now and again we get a strange sense of guilt about loving this perfectly planned life. We watch visitors’ first anxious sense that they’ve fallen into the Truman Show quickly disappear as they realise just how upside-down their perception of a “normal” city is.Here, good public space and architecture is for everyone. There’s a large amount of social housing in Houten but you’d be hard-pressed to pick it out because there’s little written into these buildings to declare who has money and who doesn’t. The shared architecture and wonderful functionality frees people to be who they are. Far from being claustrophobic, it’s liberating.My family were lucky – we had the Dutch passport my father-in-law handed down to his Australian-born children when his own family left post-war Holland. Our daughters were old enough to know what they were leaving behind in Norwich. They may have hated us the day we dropped them into a local Dutch school with no language, but they survived. They missed their friends at first but now they love their independence, the clean air and Houten’s close community. On visits to family in London and Australia, all three kids are astounded at how much time they have to spend in the car, how noisy everything is and how dependent children are on their parents.Not everyone has the chance to make the choices we did. But none of what Houten stands for is radical or alternative. This Dutch city’s choice to move away from the car, to clear the air, to invest in healthy iniduals, is not an unreachable ideal.Houten is the future many of us trapped in car-focused societies dream of, but it’s happening here and now. Nothing is stopping other cities from making the same decisions.

What could he mean, I wondered. When I discovered that he used this phrase to indicate that the economy is past its peak and “no longer potent”, I was astonished.As a “mature” woman, I found the comments rather offensive and demeaning. Not only are these stereotypes dangerous, they are utterly wrong. In fact, millions of menopausal women are in, or are yet to enter, their prime.Ben Broadbent has now apologised, and no doubt he is truly sorry, but the fact that he made these comments clearly indicates these are his views. This type of bias, whether conscious or unconscious, has no place in modern thinking. Such language signals an attitude to older women that should have been consigned to the history books by now, but clearly persists.Indeed, as a champion for older workers, I am aware that these comments are a classic example of the gender bias that permeates the workplace all too often, and prevents many older women from achieving the status they deserve. In some industries, women are locked out of promotions, and career progression stops once they reach their late 40s or 50s.Let me explain more precisely why these remarks are so worrying. They send out a signal to women in business – from younger women who are trying to build a career to older ones – that such derogatory attitudes may still permeate the business world from the very top.To be clear, the idea that the menopause signals that a woman has passed her peak productivity must be rebutted in the strongest terms. They are not past their peak at all – they are just moving into a new phase of their life, which can often be more dynamic. They have more wisdom, maturity and life experience, which can make them more productive and energetic. Each woman experiences menopause differently, but the idea that it signals some kind of female slowdown is simply not true.As business champion for older workers, when writing my report calling for greater support for people over 50 in employment I described the menopause as the “last taboo” of health issues in the workplace. Women don’t talk about this, and the fact that so many women do not discuss it openly means there may be an element of shame. If women talked about it, perhaps men might understand it more.There is nothing to be ashamed of this is just a temporary health issue, with no significance for work or performance. Mental health is discussed openly now, whereas it used to be hidden away, so come on, ladies – let’s show the men that we will not tolerate being unfairly stigmatised in this way. Menopause hot flushes are actually what I call “power surges” and the body changes can even be liberating.It’s time to shout out about the value of women of all ages and get rid of the old-fashioned, damaging gender biases that have held sway at the top of the male-dominated business world for far too long.• Ros Altmann is the UK government’s older workers’ business champion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae1336dacd214cee4980936457a5249b40794d13/0_405_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34f27ad5ffcb3a3b4a0c5cddfe0ab829","title":"labour hostile environment","story":"In 2013, I interviewed a Nigerian man called Isa Muazu, who had come to the UK because he was fleeing Boko Haram. He wound up at Harmondsworth immigration detention centre, where he began a three-month hunger strike. He lost vision in both eyes, experienced chest pain and shortness of breath, and eventually became too weak to sit up unaided. At the time I thought he would die alone on a mattress on the floor of his cell. In the end, he was flown to Lagos by the British government and I never heard from him again. He told me: “I have never committed any crimes nothing like this has ever happened to me before.”A recent YouGov poll showed that the British public is mostly in favour of the “hostile environment” policies for immigrants, categorised as the requirement to show documents before accessing a GP, accepting a job, renting property or opening a bank account. Do the public also realise that Muazu’s experience is also a consequence of the hostile environment? That we lock up innocent people for indefinite periods of time and treat them worse than animals in a zoo?Only today, distressing footage emerged of Zixuan Qu, a woman who was encouraged by a British college to come here and study, being raided by six immigration officers. Qu has been waiting for the Home Office to sort her visa and has tried several ways of speeding up the process. In our names, her house was raided at 5am, and she was threatened with removal from the home she shares with her fiance.This is why Diane Abbott’s announcement that Labour will end the hostile environment is so welcome: the grotesque mix of incompetence and cruelty from the Home Office has led to the most abject and degrading treatment of migrants, ostensibly for the benefit of British people. Finally, Labour would close the detention centres that have been a stain on the national conscience for so long, rightfully recognising that people often come to this country seeking asylum because they are escaping war, violence or abuse. Labour would redirect the funds used to run detention centres to the services these asylum seekers desperately need.But the announcement should also come with political awareness. When 10 countries – including Poland, Hungary, Latvia and Lithuania – joined the EU in 2004, the Labour government made little attempt to engage with the public about what the effects might be. As a result, that vacuum was filled by the rightwing press, which responded to the change in the most aggressively xenophobic way possible.Lessons must be learned from that, and now Labour – with the support of civil society – needs to join the dots for the public about what the reality of UK immigration policy has been.Alongside this announcement should come a drive to reverse the frankly rabid rhetoric that habitually accompanies debates about immigration in this country. We can’t pretend descriptions of migrants as “swarms” and “cockroaches” have not set the tone on immigration, and will not have influenced the public in terms of what kinds of attitudes and behaviours are deemed permissible. This kind of rhetoric must be confronted head-on wherever possible, by all of us who want a more humane country. Labour’s announcement is fantastic, but the hostile environment extends further than policy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3324de1a1d5f68db4c41cb86d02cc523590cb5/0_252_7346_4409/master/7346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dcc5ef5c856ee57b07b251311e5efc0","title":"ian hislop picks banksy hoax for british museum dissent show","story":"Graffiti artist’s Peckham Rock placed in museum as prank will feature among objects illustrating subversionAt the time it was somewhat embarrassing but 13 years after Banksy installed a hoax exhibit at the British Museum curators are finally seeing the funny side.The museum has announced it has approached the artist to lend a piece formally known as Peckham Rock – a small “cave painting” of a stone-age hunter pushing a supermarket trolley. The artwork was left in the museum by Banksy, along with a convincing panel of text which earnestly explained it was from the “Post-Catatonic era”. It went unnoticed by staff for at least a day, possibly a lot longer.The rock will be part of an autumn exhibition for which Ian Hislop has gone through the British Museum’s vast collection to choose more than 100 objects which have stories of dissent, subversion or satire.Hislop, the editor of Private Eye and described by the British Museum’s chairman Sir Richard Lambert as “the nation’s raspberry blower-in-chief”, said it had been enormous fun.“We are very sneery about the past, we are very condescending about other cultures and other times and imagine that only we are brave enough, bright enough or sensible enough to notice there is something wrong with the way we’re governed,” he said. “The great thing about this exhibition is to show that people have always noticed.”The display of the Banksy piece “proves that the British Museum can take a joke”, said Hislop, although it was not viewed as being all that funny by everyone concerned at the time.There were questions of whether the artwork should enter the collection but tricky paperwork and the rock’s sniffily official designation as “lost property” meant it did not happen. Tom Hockenhull, the British Museum curator who is working on the show with Hislop, said: “It was the cause of considerable embarrassment for the museum at the time and when Banksy asked for it back we were only too pleased to oblige.”Hislop said it took him about 30 seconds to say yes when the former director Neil MacGregor came up with the idea for the show.One of his favourite objects in the show will be a brick from the ancient Babylonian reign of Nebuchadnezzar. All bricks had to bear the king’s name but, amazingly, the brickmaker has written his own name over the king’s before it was put in a wall. “Is he doing this to have a laugh?” asked Hislop. “Is he doing it for his friends? Or is he doing it just to say, ‘Well, I can do this’.”There will be objects that fall into the “hiding in plain sight” category, such as a the 16th-century Stonyhurst Salt, a salt cellar which, with the beads of Christ’s blood and crosses, was clearly a Catholic sacramental object. But they were banned, so it was a salt cellar.From the museum’s 12,000 or so satirical prints will be a particularly vicious one by James Gillray from 1792 of the Prince of Wales: morbidly obese, picking his teeth with a fork, and surrounded by medication for venereal disease.“I don’t think anyone has ever been as rude about anyone as they were about the Prince Regent,” said Hislop wistfully.Other objects will include an Edwardian coin with the king’s head defaced with the slogan “Votes for Women” a woven raffia cloth from the Democratic Republic of Congo which subverts the image of a leaping leopard, the symbol of Zaire’s dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and a pink knitted pussy hat worn at the January 2017 women’s march against Donald Trump.There will also be plenty of filth, Hislop promised, including a first-century oil lamp of Cleopatra having sex with a crocodile.Hislop said the exhibition would tell the stories of people risking their lives as well as people risking nothing at all. “It is an extraordinary demonstration of spirit from thousands of years ago until now.”• I Object: Ian Hislop’s search for dissent is at the British Museum, London, from 6 September to 20 January 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa .

The former Everton and Manchester United manager was appointed to replace Slaven Bilic in November on a six-month deal and guided them to a 13th-place finish, having taken over with the team in the relegation zone.West Ham’s owners, David Sullivan and David Gold, had initially indicated that would be enough to earn Moyes a two-year extension but the Scot was informed in a meeting on Wednesday that his contract would not be renewed. The move comes after Sam Allardyce, a former West Ham manager, was also sacked by Everton.West Ham said they hope to appoint a “high-calibre” successor within the next 10 days and have previously expressed an interest in Shakhtar Donetsk’s Paulo Fonseca and Rafael Benítez, who might prove too expensive to prise away from Newcastle. They have held informal talks with Manuel Pellegrini, although the former Manchester City manager has also been heavily linked with Sevilla.Other options include Burnley’s Sean Dyche, Huddersfield’s David Wagner and Marco Silva, the former Hull and Watford manager. Their preference is to hire a manager who has worked in the Premier League, despite their interest in Fonseca.Sullivan said: “I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to David Moyes and his staff for achieving the target of keeping West Ham United in the Premier League.”The announcement arrived barely 12 hours after Gold said he hoped the 55-year-old former Manchester United and Everton manager would remain in charge for next season. Moyes’ assistants Alan Irvine, Stuart Pearce and Billy McKinlay have also departed.Sullivan added: “Throughout his time here, David has carried himself with dignity and honesty and we have all found him to be a pleasure to work with. He, Alan, Stuart and Billy accepted the challenge and attacked it head on, turning around a difficult situation. They deserve great respect for the job they have done and they leave the club with our best wishes.“When David and his team arrived, it was the wish of both parties that the focus be only on the six months until the end of the season, at which point a decision would be made with regards to the future. Having taken stock of the situation and reflected now the campaign is complete, we feel that it is right to move in a different direction.“We are already taking steps to identify and recruit the manager we believe can take West Ham United forward in line with our ambitions. We aim to appoint a high-calibre figure who we feel will lead the club into an exciting future for our loyal supporters within the next 10 days.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/382f8e92f040b3597652274f7e28fa8a783d5589/0_128_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e033457519d6843a1c22f6aa9026d271","title":"england world cup squad russia 2018","story":"The uncapped Liverpool youngster Trent Alexander-Arnold has been included in England’s squad for the summer’s World Cup after Gareth Southgate revealed a youthful 23-man party “which we can be excited about” for the tournament in Russia.Alexander-Arnold joins a group boasting only 11 previous appearances at the finals, and only five survivors from Roy Hodgson’s squad which failed to emerge from the group stage in Brazil four years ago.

As anticipated, there is no place for Joe Hart, Ryan Bertrand or Jack Wilshere, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez are injured.“I believe this is a squad which we can be excited about,” said Southgate, who will welcome all but the contingent from FA Cup finalists Chelsea and Manchester United and Champions League finalists Liverpool to St George’s Park next Monday to begin preparations for Russia. “It is a young group, but with some really important senior players, so I feel the balance of the squad is good, both in terms of its experience, its character and also the positional balance.“We have a lot of energy and athleticism in the team, but players that are equally comfortable in possession of the ball and I think people can see the style of play we’ve been looking to develop.

We feel the team are improving and we want to continue that momentum.” Only in 1958 and 2006 will England have travelled to the World Cup with a younger squad, with 11 of the final 23 boasting fewer than 20 caps.Alexander-Arnold, who has made three appearances for the under-21s, had been invited to train with the senior squad ahead of the games against the Dutch and the Azzurri and has enjoyed an impressive season at Anfield. The 19-year-old has made the most of the absence through injury of Nathaniel Clyne and Gomez for long periods this term, and played a key role in the eye-catching Champions League knockout victories over Manchester City and Roma.Southgate has monitored his progress closely. “The first call up for Trent Alexander-Arnold is well deserved,” he said. “When we pick young players, it’s not just because they are young, it’s because their performances deserve it. We’ve also had a couple of injuries with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joe Gomez, which is a huge blow for them personally and disappointing for us.” Alexander-Arnold offers back-up to Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker at right wing-back, and could be utilised in midfield if required having featured there for Liverpool.The teenager, along with his club-mate Jordan Henderson, will only link up with the squad after the friendly with Nigeria next month, with Southgate insistent his players enjoy a week’s break after the end of their club seasons. The Football Association’s medical staff are confident the knee injury sustained by Trippier against Newcastle earlier this month, which sidelined him on the final day of the season, will not hamper him in Russia, and will assess him again when he joins up with the squad next week.Southgate has spent time this week speaking with those players who did not make the final cut and, while Wilshere has not played for his country since the Euro 2016 defeat to Iceland, there were difficult conversations with Hart and Bertrand, who had played a significant part in qualifying and would have expected to be involved.“Ryan and Joe have played a lot over the last two years so they’re not decisions we took lightly,” said the manager. “I could’ve had easier conversations by keeping them involved. With Joe, we’ve got three other goalkeepers who have had very good seasons and the decision I was faced with was: do I keep Joe in and have experience around the group? Or give the three guys who have basically had a better season a chance? We felt the players all needed to be in on merit after their performances this season.“Ryan is also very unfortunate in that it’s probably one of the strongest positions we have. Ryan has had a decent season but I just felt the others were ahead of him. Both calls were really tough. They’re both good guys and have contributed a lot throughout qualification, so it wasn’t an enjoyable part of the job and I feel it’s important to acknowledge their contribution in getting us to Russia.”Neither has been included on the five-man standby list, with Lallana joined by Burnley’s Tom Heaton and James Tarkowski, Lewis Cook of Bournemouth and West Brom’s Jake Livermore. They will join the squad at the training camp next week in the hope that an opportunity still presents itself, with Lallana to be promoted to the 23 if any of England’s forward options succumbs to injury in the next few weeks.“History tells us that one of those standby players may end up in the squad, as it’s very unusual for us to get through the end of the season and our two preparation games without any issues,” added Southgate. “All of the guys on standby have been really professional in their approach to this. They recognise there’s still an opportunity and we’ve had a lot of conversations over a period of time with them about their situation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92f93433091d559f96cd85c62359ce725d9fbd28/1058_890_1574_945/master/1574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57c4d13a12489da45cf9c9a39e51b6ed","title":"wretched football sam allardyce everton sack","story":"It was overshadowed at the time by his tales of Romelu Lukaku and voodoo, late‑night calls from Jim White and Ross Barkley’s contract demands, but even now, four months on, it is staggering to recall Farhad Moshiri telling Everton’s AGM he decided to give Sam Allardyce the most important job at the club after reading the former England manager’s autobiography. No Evertonian at the Philharmonic Hall in January needed to flick through Big Sam to confirm suspicions the latest chapter would end acrimoniously and swiftly. His was a desperate and ill-judged appointment, and his removal alone will not rectify the serious drift at Goodison Park.Allardyce leaves Everton after six miserable months with his reputation as a survival specialist intact. Therein lies the failure. Everton, as the 63-year‑old admitted when installed as Ronald Koeman’s replacement in November, represented the best opportunity of his club career to shatter preconceptions about his management style.He succeeded only in confirming they were legitimate. Wretched football on a weekly basis, taking responsibility for victory while abdicating it in defeat and an arrogant dismissal of supporters were not the basis for building consensus or hope for the future. Not that the Everton hierarchy have delivered on that score.Yes, Allardyce inherited a weak squad that, one year after the costliest recruitment drive in Everton’s history – costly in every sense – is in need of major reconstruction. But it was a squad clear from relegation danger by Christmas after a seven-game unbeaten start to his reign. Allardyce had five months to implement improvements in style, performance and results while showing he was invested in Everton for the long term. He did not deliver on any count. The anaemic defeat at West Ham last Sunday, coming after the manager had given players several days off in the buildup, was a fitting farewell to an appalling season from all concerned.In fairness to those who ignored Allardyce’s unsuitability and oversaw the unpopular appointment, there was a sensible economic reason for seeking insurance when the team floundered earlier in the season. Those behind the decision were Moshiri, the director of football, Steve Walsh, and the directors Alexander Ryazantsev and Keith Harris, who were promoted to chief finance and commercial officer and deputy chairman, respectively, on Tuesday.Everton’s unexpected regression on the pitch coincided with the club negotiating with Liverpool city council and global financial institutions for the £500m required to build a new stadium at Bramley Moore dock. The strength of Everton’s case to lenders is based, in part, on being a safe Premier League concern that has been ever-present in the top flight since 1954. This was not the season to demonstrate the fragility of that proud record by even flirting with relegation. Progress has been slow on the project that will define Moshiri’s legacy, however, when it could have strengthened the case for Allardyce’s appointment in the short term. The council is yet to sign off a proposed £280m loan that could generate a profit of £7m a year in interest for the austerity-battered authority over 25 years.Allardyce’s detractors have argued Everton were never seriously in peril and his claim to have inherited “chaos” from a caretaker manager in David Unsworth who was “struggling to cope” was part of a self-serving PR strategy. There is an element of truth to both sides. Everton were 13th but only five points above the relegation zone following Unsworth’s final game in charge, a 4-0 victory over West Ham that Allardyce shamelessly claimed as his own. That and many other erroneous boasts fuelled supporters’ antagonism as much as football devoid of joy or entertainment.One undeniable statistic favoured by the former Everton manager pinpointed his impact. Everton conceded an alarming 27 goals in the 10 games before Allardyce’s arrival (he would insist nine games on account of West Ham) but the same amount over the next 20. Defensive organisation apart, his average points return over 24 Premier League matches was almost identical to Unsworth’s over five – 1.41 per game compared with 1.4 under the club’s under-23s manager. And there was not one impressive performance among them. His tenure will be remembered instead, if at all, for attempting to bring on a defensive midfielder, Morgan Schneiderlin, at 0-0 against Watford, only to summon a striker when Troy Deeney scored what proved the winner for being content with a point at Swansea for having the second-lowest number of shots on target in the Premier League season and a style of play that one rival manager branded “Conference football” following a game at Goodison.Allardyce talked frequently of planning for next season but never convinced anyone that Everton was anything other than one brief, lucrative and possibly final job. He was up against it from the start in that respect. Moshiri initially offered him a six-month contract having been unable to prise Marco Silva from Watford. It took five weeks, culminating in a 5-1 home defeat by Atalanta and a 4-1 loss at Southampton in the space of four calamitous days, before the major shareholder bowed to Allardyce’s demands for an 18-month deal without a break clause. The manager would become a magnet for disenchantment among supporters fed mediocrity under Bill Kenwright’s ownership and now a lack of vision on the pitch under Moshiri. But Allardyce was emblematic of a deeper malaise at Everton, one the club’s board have to correct this summer.The club exposed Allardyce to ridicule with the survey that asked club members to rate his performance on a scale of zero to 10. It may have been a wide-ranging survey, it may have been a repeat of last year’s exercise under Koeman, but its publication this year, when Allardyce was regularly being told where to go during away games, reflected the leadership vacuum in a business getting the small details wrong.The Monaco-based Moshiri is expected to acquire a majority stake in Everton soon and can ill-afford his third managerial failure with the team regressing from the top six and the stadium vision yet to take shape. The rate of change occurring at Goodison is recognition of the need for improvement. PSV Eindhoven’s technical director, Marcel Brands, has been appointed as the new director of football in place of Walsh, who presided over a disastrous recruitment policy and will leave. The deputy chief executive, Denise Barrett‑Baxendale, has been confirmed as Robert Elstone’s replacement, with the chief executive heading to Super League after 13 years. The growing influence of Harris and Ryazantsev behind the scenes was also recognised in Tuesday’s executive restructure.That leaves the not insignificant matters of a stadium finance deal and a fourth management team in eight months to be resolved. Everton are relieved of Allardyce but in many respects are also back to square one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e385662d02bc3b123ddce8972916dc605230f97d/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f1bc5a71290e63f5a0a46d9f62a7b41","title":"england world cup squad russia 2018 southgate final 23 in pictures","story":"Analysis of the 23 players who will be on the plane to Russia in June for the 2018 World Cup"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ceb959f71dd20f6c54a54751e3c3439d44a4e7b/0_0_2120_1272/master/2120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4fae44f1bd9a98fe2de7adc36ddd581","title":"football broken dreams african teenagers sold premier league lie nepal","story":"He went to Nepal hoping it would be a stepping stone to playing for Chelsea. Instead, Aboubacar Sidibé became another victim of unscrupulous ‘agents’ who promise young men a shot at the big time only to swindle them Like thousands of football-mad teenagers in Mali, Aboubacar Sidibé dreamed of one day playing for Chelsea. So when a football manager approached him with the promise of a contract with a club in India – a launchpad, he was told, to the European clubs – he jumped at the chance.It didn’t matter that he was just 17. Or that he would have to pay the manager more than £2,700. It seemed a price worth paying to kickstart his football career. Weeks later, Sidibé was indeed playing football abroad, but he was no closer to Stamford Bridge. Instead, he found himself kicking a torn football around a dusty pitch in a country he had never heard of before: Nepal.“When I arrived it was not at all what the manager had told me … Every time I get in touch with him he says it’ll be OK. But it will not be OK. I hate him. He cheated me,” says Sidibé.Ranked 162 out of 207 nations by FIFA, Nepal is an unlikely destination for aspiring footballers. But it does have an entry policy that allows visitors from almost any country to get a visa on arrival.And so they come: a small but steady stream of young men from west Africa, hoping Nepal will be the first step on the road to football stardom. They follow an exodus of tens of thousands of African players, often teenagers like Sidibé, chasing their footballing dreams to the most remote corners of the world.In 2017, more than 100 people from Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Benin and Togo entered Nepal.They were promised the chance to play in Nepal’s football league, an offer that comes with a club, contract, and work permit. On arrival, however, they learned they had been sold a lie.Football in Nepal has been almost completely on hold for the past three years first interrupted by the 2015 earthquake, when the national stadium was damaged, and then repeatedly postponed by mismanagement and a dispute between different factions of the All Nepal Football Association (Anfa).But most of the Africans in Nepal have no invitation and no club.As the months slipped by, Sidibé gave up going to football practice. Instead, he whiled away his days watching Premier League matches on his phone in a cold basement flat on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.On a clear day he could see the towering, snow-clad Himalayas from his window. “I had never heard of Nepal before I came here. It’s a country for tourists. It’s not a place to come and earn a living,” says Sidibé, sitting on a foam mat that doubles as his bed.Without a contract and regular league games, many of the young Africans are struggling to make ends meet. Anything they do earn goes on food, rent and extending their visas. “I was earning more in Mali than I earn now … I’m trying to get out and play in another country,” says Sidibé.But that too is difficult. Like almost all the west African footballers in Nepal, Sidibé only bought a one-way plane ticket. Without the money to survive in the country, or to buy a flight home, he is trapped. “I have to pay back my debt. I’m so demoralised … We don’t have enough to eat. At night, we lie down but we don’t sleep.”Sidibé shares the flat with five other west African footballers. There is no furniture, so they sit on the concrete floor or perch on upturned buckets in the kitchen. Kande Sidibé, another young Malian who paid thousands of dollars to the same manager, seems to express everyone’s mood. “I really regret coming here … I’ve only played four or five matches in five months … We are suffering here. It’s very difficult.”The group only comes to life when they talk about football. An excited argument breaks out over who will win the World Cup. Most are putting their bets on Germany or Brazil. No one thinks England stands a chance. “Our dream is to play with big teams in Europe,” says Die Lekpahisaira from Ivory Coast. “European managers come to Asia to scout for talent, so we come here to get exposure … if they see we have talent, they will tell others.” While they wait to be spotted, the only way they can earn anything is to travel the country playing in small knockout tournaments for as little as £18 a match. It’s a gruelling routine. “You finish a match at 6pm, get on a night bus to the other side of the country, and are expected to play again at 3pm … And if you lose in the first round you are out, so we pray we win the first match,” says Leo Mballa, a footballer from Cameroon, who lives in a small room on the other side of Kathmandu.Mballa sits on blankets on an otherwise bare concrete floor. Football boots are strewn across the room. A single rice cooker and a cardboard box with a few vegetables in it serves as the kitchen. A blanket and towel make do for curtains.The only thing worse than playing in the tournaments is not playing. To get a game, the Africans typically need an introduction from a Nepali, for which they have to pay – either upfront or by handing over a cut of their earnings. Mballa says Nepali “agents” demand up to £185 to find them a place in a team. “If you don’t pay, you don’t play.” The players are victims of an informal network of recruiters and brokers, which stretches from “managers” in west Africa, to Africans who have lived in Nepal or India for years.Philip Atanda’s case is typical. The Ivorian says he paid a “huge amount” to a manager in his home country, who had lived in Nepal for a few years. “He told me there would be a league and I would have the opportunity to join a team … He said I could gets lots of money … But nothing like that has happened,” says Atanda.Everyone wants to leave, but no one wants to return home. “My family don’t know about my situation,” says Aboubacar Sidibé. “We took a big loan and I can’t return with nothing. I’d rather die than go home with nothing.”A month later, Sidibé buckled. He called his family for help, and left Nepal. But instead of returning to Mali, his flatmates say he decided to try his luck in Morocco. His dream of playing for Chelsea is as distant as ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d665b8e9547949220500efe138b6c63922e1f35/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34726e09a33baece93dd1fe60d0f40e2","title":"council europe assembly censures former president corruption inquiry","story":"Pedro Agramunt banned from senior roles for 10 years after probe into vote-riggingA former president of the Council of Europe’s parliamentary assembly will be banned from holding any senior post in the human rights body for 10 years, after a major corruption inquiry into vote-rigging.The unprecedented punishment has been handed down to the Spanish senator Pedro Agramunt, who has ignored calls to resign. He is backed by Spain’s governing conservative party – itself mired in domestic corruption scandals – to which he belongs.The assembly (Pace) of the body set up after the second world war to safeguard democracy on the continent announced on Wednesday that Agramunt would be banned from chairing committees or taking part in election observation missions.It was the latest response to a 10-month judge-led inquiry into cash for votes in favour of Azerbaijan’s autocratic government, a scandal that has plunged the Council of Europe into turmoil. Published last month, the inquiry stated that 15 past and former members had broken the ethics code, while four were “strongly suspected” of corruption.Three other deputies, who were named in the report, have also been banned from taking senior positions for two years. Jordi Xuclà of the Catalan separatist party PDeCAT, which has also faced corruption allegations in recent years, was the leader of the liberal group until he stood down last October. Cezar Florin Preda of Romania resigned as head of the European People’s Party, the largest in the assembly, while insisting he was not guilty of any offence. Samad Seyidov is the head of Azerbaijan’s delegation. All, including Agramunt, have denied any wrongdoing.The fall from grace is most spectacular for Agramunt, who was president of the assembly until October 2017, when he was forced out after joining a Russian-government trip to meet the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad. The Spanish politician has been strongly criticised for refusing to give evidence to the corruption inquiry, which said it “strongly suspected” he was party to “corruptive behaviour”. The four men will be barred from representing Pace in other international bodies, but will retain the right to speak in the assembly, which is unable to force them out. In a resolution passed last month, Pace called on national political parties “to each draw the consequences of any allegations against their members”, while calling on iniduals to consider resignation.But Spain’s People’s party concluded last month that the inquiry had “no legal consequences”. According to El País, Agramunt has the support of a large majority in the PP. The party, led by the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has been mired in corruption scandals over recent years.In July last year, Rajoy became the first serving Spanish premier to testify in a criminal trial after he was called to give evidence in the Gürtel case, in which 37 business and political figures are accused of involvement in a kickbacks-for-contracts scheme.Rajoy, who was the PP’s vice secretary general between 1990 and 2003, emphatically denied any knowledge of an illegal funding racket within the party.Meanwhile, the fall-out from the Council of Europe corruption inquiry continues, with the prospect of further sanctions, including for two British ex-MPs.The former Conservative MP Robert Walter was found by the inquiry to have broken the assembly’s code of conduct, by failing to declare a conflict of interest linked to his wife’s trade lobbying activities in Azerbaijan. Giving evidence, he strongly denied any conflict of interest.Walter had led an election observation mission for Pace in Azerbaijan and carried out an investigation into the disputed territory of Nagorno Karabakh. The former MP Mike Hancock, who was expelled from the Liberal Democrats, was censured for failing to give evidence. During his time at Pace, Hancock was a frequent guest in Baku and once praised its electoral process. He declined to attend the inquiry, citing his health and the fact he was no longer an MP.Both men face being stripped of the prestige title “honorary associate” of the assembly, as well as use of the buildings.The report has been sent to the speakers of all 47 parliaments that send MPs to the Strasbourg assembly. Pieter Omtzigt, a Dutch MP, who led calls to launch the inquiry, said: “I am very interested to see what the House of Commons will decide to do.”A spokesperson for the Commons Speaker, John Bercow, declined to comment. The parliamentary commissioner for standards has the power to investigate ex-MPs, an exceptional measure that takes place only following consultations with the Commons committee on standards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a59b63caca1b955ce7eea3fab76370b5097e4c/0_973_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=839376a92b3750a4f3e68edb65822917","title":"peter gordons recipe for red curried butternut squash mushrooms and spinach","story":"Cook the butternut squash with cardamom and a puree of tomato, red pepper and chilli for a delicious and versatile dishThis is a very mild curry, but you can jazz it up with extra chilli and spices such as cumin and coriander seeds.

We’ve met exactly once, through Skype. Inside the package is a gift I’m really hoping they like. At the very least, I hope it doesn’t explode in transit. That sounds a hell of a lot scarier than it actually is – I just really want this parcel to make it to its destination. And there’s a decent chance it might not, because inside all the bubble wrap are two bottles of Hal’s New York Limited Edition Coffee Seltzer.For people like us, seltzer is way more than just a beverage.I am now the sort of person who knows about things like limited-edition coffee seltzer, because I have become a member of a somewhat-secret seltzer society called “Now Fizzing”. (My entry is granted after I track down members on Twitter and share my seltzer-loving truth.) It’s a closed Facebook group that’s been around since 21 November 2014, and it’s composed of more than 3,100 members from around the world. Within the group, its members offer and ask for tips on where to find sought-after flavors and brands (the Polar seltzer’s seasonal flavors are always a huge hit – right now, everyone is on the hunt for its Blood Orange Lemonade, Starfruit Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade Seltzer’ade flavors), share selfies and videos of themselves trying new kinds of seltzer for the first time (called “seltzies” and “fizzeos”, respectively), and discuss other aspects of their lives through the lens of the drink that has brought them all together.There’s a two-year-old “star” of Now Fizzing, the daughter of a member who is being filmed doing a March Madness–style seltzer taste test. The group even has its own lexicon: seltzer is “fizz”, unflavored varieties are “ghosts” and other clear sweetened beverages that are simply masquerading as seltzer are called “snakes”.Now Fizzing was launched about a year before seltzer became the “it” drink that it is today. There has already been much ink spilled over the beverage’s meteoric rise, but to this day, even the makers of seltzer find themselves stunned and confused by the sudden trendiness of their product. Chris Taylor, senior vice-president of Boylan Bottling Co and a member of Now Fizzing, chalks up seltzer’s trendiness to all the innovation going on within the space, paired with the drink’s positioning as a healthy alternative to juice or soda. Say what you will about the seltzer craze that has swept the nation, tweet your vitriolic La Croix memes, or lambast the millennials for their obsession with something you see as (literally) devoid of substance, people love this drink. But few people love it as much as the Fizz Fam does.I was late to the seltzer bandwagon. I really only began drinking it this past summer, a love that developed out of an unexpected appreciation for the majorly refreshing and full-flavored La Croix Pamplemousse (grapefruit). Then, the Polar winter seasonals (particularly Lime Ginger Mule) and Trader Joe’s Starfruit Seltzer clinched my identity as a seltzer enthusiast, and my love for the fizzy drink has bubbled over since I decided to stop drinking alcohol for an indeterminate period back in February. And that’s no coincidence: a significant number of Fizzers don’t drink alcohol. Sometimes Fizzers post seltzies to celebrate sobriety anniversaries.I was first introduced to Now Fizzing nearly two years ago by a former roommate, who is an active member. The first time she mentioned it, I probably scoffed pretty hard, already a little annoyed with the accumulating boxes of Polar Seltzer’ades being stored in our communal space. And I didn’t fully get it – not just the seltzer obsession, but the idea of a selzter community – until I actually joined the group years later, using a new Facebook account created explicitly for that purpose.Having abandoned most social media platforms for their negative effect on my mental health about six months prior, wading into the supportive world of Now Fizzing was more refreshing than an ice-cold glass bottle of Topo Chico with a twist of fresh lime.When Solomon first created the group, he had no idea what would eventually come of it. Like many others, his own personal journey into the world of fizz began when he decided to give up soda (a major vice of his that resulted from managing a bar as a nondrinker). After a weekend trip with friends to a dry campground, where they guzzled seltzer nonstop, Solomon decided to create the group as a play on Now Spinning, a Facebook group for vinyl enthusiasts to share what they’re listening to.Since then, “it’s grown beyond whatever I could have imagined,” Solomon tells me. At first, the group was composed of just his friends, but it grew exponentially, perhaps aided by the seltzer craze that seems to have first struck around 2015, a year after the group was created. While Now Fizzing primarily exists online, its members have met up in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Seattle. Besides these planned events, Fizzers occasionally recognize each other offline thanks to the distinguishing seltzer-shaped pin and Now Fizzing T-shirt created by members and advertised within the group. And this past December, a bunch of Fizzers banded together to ship Solomon six boxes of Polar’s Mango Limeade to ensure he’d be hydrated during his annual 25-hour radio show.To find out what made this group so joyful, I began asking around. In addition to being an active member of Now Fizzing, Amanda Brennan is an expert on online communities and fandoms. Understanding the way these networks function and thrive is literally part of her job as the senior content insights manager at Tumblr. And she says that, without question, Now Fizzing is particularly special.“In the climate of internet where there’s a lot of bad things going on, it’s so great to have this group that feels very pure and very positive just really about this thing that we all love,” Brennan tells me.Her sentiments are shared by the 15 other members I spoke with, all of whom were exceptionally enthusiastic in their love of both “fizz” and the group. Time and time again, the same adjectives came up: fun, supportive, wholesome, safe, pure, positive, friendly and earnest.Aria, a Boston-based member of Fizz Fam, tells me a story about a time when she called her mom, who was in the grocery store, to ask her to scope out the scene for new Polar Seltzer’ade flavors. Confused, her mom repeated her request out loud in the aisle, catching the attention of a man who was looking for the same thing. Unable to find it, her mom hung up – only to call back a minute later to tell Aria that the nice man had found it in another aisle and returned to share the good news.Fizzers, it appears, are the type of strangers for whom kindness comes naturally. “I’m not sure if all seltzer drinkers are good people,” a Fizzer named Randi explained in an email she wrote me while drinking Polar Orange Vanilla, “but these members are.”While scrolling through the group for new seltzer flavors, I became so intrigued by its dynamics that I decided to reach out to my former colleague Annemarie Dooling, now the audience development manager at Vox Media. She has more than 10 years of experience moderating communities and is an expert on digital human behavior.After patiently listening to me drone on about the group, Dooling tells me that there are a few logical reasons for Now Fizzing’s success. One of these is the group’s relatively small size. Another is the coincidental timing of seltzer becoming a cultural phenomenon. But mostly, she says, it’s simply the members who set the tone with such a laser-focused passion.“People who like certain things and are kind of fanatical about them always find each other,” Dooling tells me, stressing that communities of interest (rather than those of circumstance or geography) are inherently special in nature.“It’s not always easy to find people who are interested in your interests,” Dooling says. “There is always a group of people that are your tribe, and it’s about finding out who your tribe is. Sometimes that tribe is in front of you, sometimes it’s virtual.”Ian and Tracy, a married couple living in the Pacific north-west, tell me that Now Fizzing is very much their tribe. They’re exceptionally regular posters within the group. Last year, they scheduled their annual summer trip to New York City to coincide with a Prospect Park meet-up planned by Solomon. They tried new flavors, met the people they had bonded with online, and had such a blast that they ended up making extra room in their packed itinerary to hang out with the new friends they’d just made.Over Skype, the three of us compare our favorite brands and flavors and discuss the larger seltzer culture. I find they’re exceptionally easy to talk to, with deep, genuine laughs and cool art hanging in their home. They talk excitedly about how they look forward to reconnecting with their seltzer friends IRL the next time they come out east.Tracy laughs and shakes her head at the sheer absurdity of the statement. But I can tell we both agree with what Ian just said. Positivity, compassion and enthusiasm can be powerful forces, especially on the internet, and especially in these isive and often toxic times. I realize that they’re the reason people join groups like this in the first place.At the end of the call, I ask Ian and Tracy if there’s any type of seltzer on the east coast that they can’t get where they live. After a stop at my favorite cafe, which stocks five different seltzer brands, I head to the post office.Allee Manning is a freelance journalist writing here and there.

Heat the oven to 150C300Fgas 2. Grease and line a deep 20cm cake tin.Cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Gradually add the eggs, vanilla and salt, and mix.In a separate bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then fold half into the butter. Add in the milk, then the remaining flour. Scrape the bottom of the bowl and mix once more. Pour into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes. Leave to cool for 15-20 minutes, then remove from its tin by running a small paring knife along the inside of the tin to release the cake. Or, if you have used a loose-bottomed tin, set the base of the cake tin on top of a tin of tomatoes, or similar, and gently push the sides of the cake tin down.To make the icing, puree the raspberries with the two tablespoons of icing sugar, then strain. Transfer to an electric mixer. Add the milk, butter and 250g of the icing sugar, and beat on low for three minutes. Add the rest of the sugar and beat until the icing is light but holds its shape. Mix in the kirsch and lemon juice.Wash and dry the cake tin, and line with clingfilm with plenty lapping over the sides and set aside. Using a serrated bread knife (the longest one you have), score a horizontal line a third of the way up the side of the cake and then slowly cut the cake into thirds horizontally. Trim the top layer slightly if it is domed. Slide a tart tin base or cardboard disc between the bottom and middle layers of the cake, and lift off the top two layers on to a large plate. Slide the bottom layer of sponge into the lined cake tin and pipe a border of icing around the edge. Don’t worry if the icing touches the sides of the tin, as you are essentially creating a dam for the filling.Smooth half the jam over, and pipe a few stripes of icing on top. This acts as a glue to adhere one cake to another and it also creates delicious pockets of jam and icing between the layers.Put the middle sponge on top and repeat the above process. Top with the third sponge, pull up the sides of clingfilm and wrap up the cake. Chill for at least two hours, or overnight before removing from the tin to ice the top and sides.

Grease a 25cm x 10cm loaf tin with butter and line the base and sides with parchment paper, to about 5cm above the top of the tin.In an electric mixer, cream the butter and sugar well. Mix in the lemon zest, then beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.In a large bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Mix half of this into the creamed butter mixture, scraping down the sides, until barely combined.With the mixer still going, beat in all the milk, then add the rest of the flour and mix until just combined. Scrape the bowl and give it one last mix.Scoop the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Bake for 50-60 minutes, until the top of the cake is springy and a skewer comes out clean.Meanwhile, make the lemon drizzle: in a small pan, heat the sugar, water and lemon juice until the sugar is just melted. Do not let it boil or it will lose its fresh flavour. While the cake is still in the tin, use a skewer to poke holes evenly throughout the baked loaf. Pour over the drizzle.To make the icing, in a small bowl, whisk the icing sugar and lemon juice until smooth. Take the cake out of the tin: run a small paring knife along the inside of the tin, then tilt the tin on its side and coax the loaf out, using the parchment as a handle. Peel off the paper and turn the loaf on your cooling rack or worktop. Drizzle with the icing and let it drip down the sides, then use a spatula or a cake or tart tin base to lift the loaf on to a serving dish.175g butter, softened, plus more for greasing175g light brown sugar2 eggsSeeds of 1 vanilla pod125g ground almonds175g wholemeal spelt flour2 tsp baking powder1 tsp salt200g halved cherries, or whole berries200g peaches or nectarines, sliced2 tbsp caster sugar, for sprinklingRose petals, for scattering (optional)For the icing (optional) 200g icing sugar1-2 tbsp rose waterHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3.

Add the vanilla and almonds, and mix to combine.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt, then gently beat the dry ingredients into the butter mixture.Spread the batter into the prepared tin and smooth the top with a palette knife or spatula. Scatter the cherries over the batter, then press the slices of peach into the top.Sprinkle with the caster sugar and bake for 60-70 minutes, until a skewer comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back to the touch. Let the cake cool in its tin for about 15 minutes before turning it out on to a serving plate.If using the icing, whisk the rose water into the icing sugar until smooth and runny. Drizzle this over the cooled cake, then scatter with garden rose petals, if you have them. This is best eaten on the day you bake it.100g unsalted butter, plus more for greasing 100g plain flour, plus more for dusting 1 tbsp honey2 tsp rose water100g caster sugar2 eggs 1 tsp baking powderFor the icing2-3 tbsp rose syrup 200g icing sugarYou will need a 12-hole madeleine tin to make these. First, prepare the tin. Melt a good amount of butter and leave to cool slightly, then brush it into the tin and dust with flour. Put the tin in your freezer for five minutes or so, then repeat the process – if you are using a silicone mould, you can omit this second step. Keep the tin in the freezer until you are ready to use it.Heat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water, carefully melt the butter, then take off the heat and leave to cool slightly. Add the honey to the butter to dissolve it, then add the rose water.In a bowl, whisk the caster sugar and eggs until smooth, then whisk in the melted butter mix. In another bowl, whisk the flour and baking powder, then whisk these dry ingredients into the egg and butter mix until smooth. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin.Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the madeleines have formed a peak in their middles and the tops spring back to the touch. Take out of the oven and leave to cool in the tin for a minute or two.Meanwhile, make the icing: whisk the rose syrup into the icing sugar until smooth and runny.Turn the madeleines out of the mould and dip them in the icing or drizzle over the top. Serve right away – they are best eaten within the hour. (Remember, you can make the madeleine mixture in advance and bake it just before you want to serve.)Butter, for greasing350g dates, pitted and chopped150g hazelnuts, toasted and chopped finely3 eggs1 tsp vanilla extract 50g caster sugar50g brown sugar200g oil140g plain flour2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp salt100g plain yoghurtFor the praline topping50g hazelnuts, toasted and skins removed50g water200g caster sugarFor the icing4 tbsp water 300g icing sugarHeat the oven to 160C325Fgas 3. Grease two 18cm cake tins with butter and line with parchment. Mix the dates and hazelnuts in a bowl and set aside.Using an electric mixer, whisk together the eggs, vanilla and sugars until light and fluffy. Keep whisking and slowly drizzle in the oil.In another bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Add this to the egg mixture and whisk for a few seconds to combine. Whisk in the yoghurt, then fold in the dates and hazelnuts.Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and bake for 35-45 minutes, until the cakes are baked but not dry. The tops of the cakes will not spring back as much as other cakes do because the dates make the mixture moist and dense in the best possible way. Leave the cakes to cool in the tins while you make the topping.To make the topping, line a baking tray with parchment paper and spread the hazelnuts on the tray. Put the tray on your worktop, near the hob. Have your icing ingredients nearby, as they will be needed as soon as the caramel is ready.Put the water in a small, heavy-bottomed pan and sprinkle in the caster sugar. Bring to the boil and, just as the sugar starts to caramelise, pour half of it over the hazelnuts. Leave to cool and harden, then break into shards.To make the icing, add the water to the remaining caramel in the pan, then pour the runny caramel from the pan into the icing sugar and whisk to a smooth paste. Add more water or icing sugar until it has the consistency of soft buttercream.

The film, due to air early next year shortly before Britain leaves the EU in March, will be written by James Graham, who has won awards for his political plays such as This House and Ink.The TV production, partly based on books written by the Sunday Times political editor, Tim Shipman, and the former Downing Street director of communications Craig Oliver, is likely to examine how Cummings led Vote Leave to victory against the odds while having a sometimes tempestuous relationship with those around him. Cummings’ involvement in the Brexit campaign is still being examined by authorities, with MPs formally requesting the former Vote Leave strategist appears in front of a select committee to answer questions, while the Electoral Commission is investigating whether his campaign broke spending rules.The Brexit drama was one of several programmes unveiled for Channel 4 by the organisation’s new director of programmes, Ian Katz, who described it as a “knotty, topical” drama.The former Newsnight editor and  deputy editor said he was committed to looking for erse and new voices, while “doubling down on some of our shows which are more popular with younger viewers”.Other shows announced by Channel 4 on Wednesday include a sitcom starring the comedian Aisling Bea, a three-part series presented by Kathy Burke on what it means to be a woman in 2018, and a pilot of a late-night satirical news programme hosted by Deborah Frances-White. There will also be an 11pm talkshow hosted by Big Narstie and a reality TV show called The Circle, in which contestants compete to become the most popular inidual on a social network without ever actually meeting.

It will be rebranded as the London and North Eastern Railway.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the House of Commons that after a “finely balanced” assessment by civil servants, he had decided to appoint the “operator of last resort” – a group led by the firm Arup and under government control – to run the service, rather than allow Stagecoach and Virgin to continue under fresh terms.Grayling said: “The route continues to generate substantial returns for the government. It is not a failing railway ... However, Virgin and Stagecoach got their bids wrong.”He insisted taxpayers had not lost out, adding: “Only Vtec and its parent companies have made losses at this time ... We cannot expect companies to take on unlimited liabilities otherwise they would not bid for franchises.”Despite the firms now avoiding up to £2bn in premium payments after the failure of the franchise, Grayling said “it would not be reasonable to place conditions” on Stagecoach or Virgin bidding for further rail services. He said: “They have paid a high financial and reputational price.”However, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said it was “absolutely ludicrous” to not place conditions on Virgin-Stagecoach’s bidding passport. He accused the government of having “cynically reprivatised” the line on the eve of the 2015 election, adding: “We’ve had bailout after bailout ... Rail companies win, passengers and taxpayers lose. Franchising remains at the heart of the alleged partnerships. No amount of tinkering can solve the failings of a broken privatised system where the public takes the risk and the companies take the profit – aided and abetted by the transport secretary.” The chair of the transport select committee, Lilian Greenwood, said the previous transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, had told the Commons in November 2014 that the promised £3.3bn for the taxpayer was robust and had been subjected to rigorous, independent scrutiny. “If Virgin-Stagecoach got their figures wrong, so did the government,” said Greenwood. She said the committee would be examining the latest failure.Grayling announced in November that the East Coast franchise would be terminated three years early in 2020, allowing the operators to avoid up to £2bn in payments until 2023. Lower passenger numbers and revenue than forecast have seen Stagecoach losing around £200m on the franchise to date.Lord Adonis, who resigned as the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission in protest at what he called the bailout of the train firms at taxpayers’ expense, said Wednesday’s decision was “vindication” of his criticisms, and that Grayling had now done the right thing. Stagecoach’s chief executive, Martin Griffiths, said the firm was “surprised and disappointed” by the decision. He said in the last three years, Vtec had “attracted more passengers, greatly increased investment, achieved industry-leading customer satisfaction and made significant payments to the taxpayer to reinvest in public services”.The collapse of the franchise marks the third time in a decade that a private train operator has failed to see out its contract on the east coast mainline, which was renationalised between 2009 and 2015.Rail unions urged Grayling to keep the line in state hands. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This is the second time that the government have called upon the public sector to launch a rescue operation on the east coast and instead of being a temporary arrangement Chris Grayling should listen to his staff and the public and make it permanent.” Grayling said he had chosen to bring in the operator of last resort to expedite his plans to introduce a partnership model for the east coast railway from 2020, where a single team including Network Rail and a private train operator would take decisions on both track and trains on the route."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c35a7df0aec0a9c1301f5e02d9bce31ea5c604b4/1_0_2582_1550/master/2582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49b7dd7b6f8b577860bfe0049358bbf","title":"jeremy corbyn mocks theresa may over brexit divisions in cabinet","story":"Labour leader presses PM at question time for details of plan for customs deal with EUJeremy Corbyn has accused the government of being “in complete disarray” over its Brexit negotiations, using prime minister’s questions to warn that delays and uncertainty caused by cabinet isions were risking jobs and investment.Focusing on Brexit for a second consecutive week, the Labour leader lambasted Theresa May for being unable even to unite her ministers around a common plan, leaving her hopelessly exposed when it comes to talks with the EU.“The isions in the cabinet means there has been no progress in negotiations for five months,” he said. “The reality is, the cabinet is more interested in negotiating with each other than it is with the European Union.”May responded by conceding that her plan for a customs system that would allow the UK to strike its own trade deals while avoiding a hard Irish border or excessive friction was “not easy”, but accused Labour of having no coherent Brexit plan of its own.In a PMQs performance in which he repeatedly and openly mocked May over the splits on what sort of customs arrangement to pursue, Corbyn began by asking: “When the prime minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?”Having to respond over laughter from the Labour benches, May said: “I think the right honourable gentleman knows full well that this government has a policy of leaving the customs union, and of ensuring that when we do so we have as frictionless trade as possible with the EU, that we have a solution which ensures we have no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and also that we have an independent trade policy.”Pressed by Corbyn on the details of her customs plan, the prime minister criticised both Labour for, she said, seeking a deal that would rule out an independent UK trade policy, and also some hard Brexiters on her own side who sought to play down the issue of the Irish border.“Now I will say to this house that achieving those objectives which I’ve just set out is not easy, it is difficult,” she said.“There will be some who will say, actually, forget about an independent trade policy. That is not the position of this government. There may be some who say, don’t worry about the Northern Irish border – that is not the position of this government.”Repeatedly citing low growth figures and warnings from companies such as Airbus and Ford over possible border checks, Corbyn said the delays appeared ominous: “If the prime minister cannot even convince her own cabinet of her strategy, what chance does she have of convincing 27 other European countries?”He ended by urging May to step aside if she could not deliver a workable Brexit: “We’ve had 23 months since the referendum. We have just 10 months to complete negotiations, and the government is in compete disarray. On both sides of the negotiations, the reality is dawning that deadlines are at risk of not being met. “More and more jobs are at risk, as more and more businesses openly consider the options of relocating their jobs elsewhere. The government is so busy negotiating with itself it cannot negotiate with anybody else. “If the prime minister cannot negotiate a good deal for Britain, why doesn’t she step aside and let Labour negotiate a comprehensive new customs union, and living standards backed by trade unions and business in this country. Step aside and make way for those who will.”May replied by saying that with Labour, voters “simply cannot trust a word that they say”.She added: “It is only the Conservative party that can be trusted by the British people to deliver a Brexit that is in the interests of British people, to deliver opportunity for all, and a Britain that is fit for the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a935b9e3ccfe630c722fe23aba461969cadf493/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea01a17137437a0b63d2f9dcc73c9789","title":"no new cameras on irish border after brexit karen bradley says","story":"Northern Ireland secretary’s comments appear to cast doubt on ‘max fac’ customs proposalThere will be no new cameras on the border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has said, warning that any physical checks on the border could be targets for criminal activity.However, she said physical infrastructure could be needed away from the border to implement whatever customs deal is struck in the Brexit negotiations.Bradley appeared to cast doubt over how the government could implement one of the two post-Brexit customs arrangements currently under consideration, the “max fac” model, where automated technology and trusted trader schemes would be used to police the border.“We are committed to no new physical infrastructure at the border, no new checks or controls at the border,” Bradley told MPs at the European scrutiny select committee.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.However, asked if she considered it a “disgrace” to suggest there would be a return to violence because of Brexit, she explained that the border had 270 crossings, some of them unmarked roads and rural lanes.“We have to be clear why having new physical infrastructure would be a problem at the border and it is the security situation,” she told MPs.But she added that it might be elsewhere: “We have to be very careful when we look at the arrangements and the suggestions that would be in place as to how we would police it how we would manage the infrastructure needed, should infrastructure be needed at some point, at some place, in order to achieve the aims of the customs arrangements.”Bradley, a close ally of Theresa May, is known to favour the other option being considered by ministers, known as the new customs partnership, in which the UK would collect taxes on behalf of the EU.“There’s no doubt that new customs partnership, the hybrid model, makes the Northern Irish border easier. It is resolved in an easier way than maximum facilitation,” she said.However, Bradley said there were “defects” with both options. “I have an open mind and I want to drill down ... to see if it is possible to make either option work.” Bradley was repeatedly challenged by two prominent Eurosceptics on the committee, its chair, Sir Bill Cash, and the Labour MP Kate Hoey, on whether cameras could constitute infrastructure.Cash said he believed concerns about the border were “deliberately stoked up to preclude a solution” and that cameras were already present and policed effectively.Bradley said she could not speculate where any new infrastructure might be, if not at the border,o but acknowledged new technological solutions to undertake any new border checks might require additional policing.Bradley was asked by Hoey if she could rule out a situation where the government was forced to accept the backstop agreed at the December European council, as part of the withdrawal agreement.The agreement says that unless a solution is found to the border issue, the UK will “maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and customs union”. Bradley said the backstop option was “not where anybody wants to be”.Quizzed by Labour’s Darren Jones, Bradley said customs was a small part of finding a solution to issue of the Irish border, given rules on plants and animal checks, are part of the single market, not the customs union. “Let’s not see the discussion about customs, which is only a very small part of the overall relationship, out of context,” she said. “We have to recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, this will be the only land border with the EU where the remaining part of the country does not have a land border with Northern Ireland. That’s why unique solutions are needed.”Jones, a supporter of the second referendum campaign People’s Vote, who quizzed Bradley at the proposal, said the lack of detail was concerning. “It’s remarkable that the government hasn’t made a single proposal on how it will deal with any single market border checks after Brexit, including on food and animal products,” he said.“Time is quickly running out, and we will have no implementation period without resolving the Northern Ireland border question. This whole fiasco is bordering on incompetence.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea9b65aed24f0531fa3b9b477eac5e497a6d89a/105_0_3895_2336/master/3895.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf45ff60a0bf2f880ed87802323c1333","title":"pmqs verdict corbyn is starting to make it look easy","story":"For the second week in a row, on a subject that for months he avoided, the Labour leader knocked the PM all over the placeBoth Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn began by offering congratulations to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on their impending marriage, and thanks to the police officers – in the public gallery – who apprehended the murderer of MP Jo Cox.Corbyn turned next to Brexit, asking when the prime minister said she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?May said her policy was to leave the customs union, having as frictionless trade as possible, no hard border in Ireland and an independent trade policy. She said a shadow minister in the Lords had voted for a second referendum, and a shadow aid minister tweeted in favour of one.

There will be a white paper, she said.Corbyn said the PM’s own position was not supported by the cabinet, quoting Rolls-Royce, Ford and Vauxhall all warning about the future of trade. Michael Gove said this week there were question marks over the PM’s customs model. But at least he did not call it crazy, as Boris Johnson did. If May can’t persuade her cabinet, then how can she persuade the EU?May’s retort was that Corbyn said there wouldn’t be a deal before December. But there was.There are record numbers of people on zero-hour contracts, Corbyn went on, and record numbers of people in poverty. He said the Dutch have already started training new customs officers. How many HMRC extra staff have been recruited to deal with Brexit?Corbyn pointed out he asked about extra HMRC staff. The Dutch government is better prepared. The government is not ready. If the government can’t negotiate a good deal, why won’t it step aside and make way for a party that will?Corbyn is starting to make it look easy. It isn’t easy, of course (winning PMQs is about the hardest task for an opposition leader), and Corbyn isn’t a natural as a parliamentary performer, but for the second week in a row, on a subject that for months he avoided at all costs, he managed to knock May all over the place.He was also more versatile than usual, combining real humour (ie, a joke that actually made people laugh, not synthetic, parliamentary humour – the laughter after his first question went on so long they will probably have to edit it out in the radio bulletins), deadly specifics (the question about HMRC staff), good attack quotes (the ones from car manufacturers), but also questions that accurately and harshly summed up the government’s failings (primarily, the absence of a Brexit negotiating position only five months before the deal is supposed to be completed).Tories who have been withering about Corbyn’s abilities should start asking themselves what it is about the government’s record that has made a Brexit PMQs such a doddle for him. May did her best to retaliate, but attacking Labour over the EU referendum sounded irrelevant and, even though she has a point about the contradictions in Labour’s Brexit policy, it is a second order issue compared with the problems with her own position.Her claim that Labour said wrongly there would never be a deal before December is a standard bit of Downing Street spin but I’m not sure it has any basis in fact (I can’t recall anyone saying on the record there would be no December deal – only a few off-the-record comments about how it looked 5050).About the only life-raft left for May was to cling to the buoyant employment figures. But, with the growth rate looking dismal, as Corbyn pointed out, that wasn’t particularly effective either.When the prime minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted ‘as little friction as possible’, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?Theresa May’s response to Corbyn’s claim of unreadiness:His position was that we should have triggered article 50 immediately after the referendum, with no work having been done in preparation for the negotiations … And what would that have led to? … They’d have sold Britain out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f031ce40f22fe26bf5530859d87e31c4c49f26/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7013b1ae24438383dc66cfaa1eb8385b","title":"readytogo rift timing indyref2 scottish independence yes movement","story":"While some Scottish independence activists warn against an early poll, others say a lengthy delay could pose an even bigger threatAs the three candidates vying to replace Angus Robertson as Scottish National party deputy leader appear at crowded hustings events across the country, one question is dominating the debate: when should the party leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, call another independence referendum?It’s a question made all the more acute after the Scottish parliament set itself on a constitutional collision course with Westminster on Tuesday afternoon, when it voted decisively to reject the UK government’s EU withdrawal bill. If Theresa May imposes the bill’s post-Brexit power-sharing plans on Scotland, overturning 20 years of precedent, then Sturgeon’s calls for a second independence referendum are unarguably bolstered. But polling consistently shows a majority across the country opposed both to independence and to holding another vote in the near future.While Scotland’s constitutional ide remains entrenched, a more recent breach has emerged among independence activists over the timing of a second referendum. In recent months, there have been public skirmishes about whether Sturgeon should deploy the mandate for a new referendum that she claims from the 2016 Holyrood elections before the parliamentary term ends in 2021, or delay until an unarguable economic case for independence has been built and public opinion is more favourable.With two out of three deputy leadership candidates calling for a vote before 2021, the ballot – the results of which will be announced at the SNP conference next month – is expected to provide a clear indication of where the party’s mass membership of more than 118,000 stands on this critical question, and how willing they will be to wait if the party leadership dismisses their growing sense of urgency.This was evident this month when more than 40,000 supporters of Scottish independence thronged the streets of Glasgow, brandishing saltires, “Still Yes” placards and the occasional unicorn, in the largest public demonstration in the city since the rally against the Iraq war in 2003. The organiser of the march, All Under One Banner, was calling for a second vote to be held before 2021, which marks the end of the Brexit transition period and the next Holyrood elections.Three years and eight months after Scotland’s momentous referendum, the appetite for energetic displays of solidarity like this one is undiminished among independence supporters. All three deputy leadership candidates attended and continue to answer questions about referendum timing at local hustings. Julie Hepburn, a favourite among activists, wants a second vote “at the earliest possible opportunity” councillor Chris McEleny is hoping for another referendum within 18 months, while Keith Brown, cabinet secretary for the economy, jobs and fair work and the most senior contender, is more circumspect, stressing the importance of campaign readiness whenever another referendum called.But, in contrast to the marchers’ #readytogo hashtag, a number of senior SNP figures have cautioned against an early poll. When Pete Wishart, the SNP’s longest-serving MP, did so last month, his pragmatism was met with outrage in some quarters of the yes movement, who denounced him on social media as “an Etonian boot-licker”.“There’s no question that we are at a turning point in the yes movement,” says Robin McAlpine, the head of Scotland’s only grassroots-funded thinktank, Common Weal, and veteran independence campaigner. “The fractiousness was always coming. There’s no more dangerous move than marching your troops back down the hill again, because they are fizzing with adrenalin and have nowhere to put it.”Sturgeon’s call in March 2017 for a second independence referendum before the start of the Brexit transition resulted in an unexpectedly fierce backlash at the general election in June. With about one-third of SNP voters backing Brexit in 2016, even those in favour of independence questioned the wisdom of linking Scotland’s future so closely to the EU. “Meanwhile, the membership are getting more restless. The assumption that the SNP have a secret plan that is so brilliant they don’t want to reveal it is in decline, and the sense that the leadership are actually a bit directionless is growing.”A more complex picture emerges from local yes groups, many of which continue to organise within their communities regardless of top-tier politicking.Among the grassroots activists that the  has spoken to, the preference remains for Sturgeon to exercise her mandate in this parliamentary term.Yes Linton – based in the Westminster constituency of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell – is one of the newest groups, having formed in January. Its founding member, Ian Reid, says: “People have a real political and strategic intelligence. The next referendum is discussed, but it’s not the only show in town.”“There are those who like the marches and the demos but on the whole we believe we are still in a preparatory phase and it is hard work and intelligent planning that matter.”Activists are also united in their determination to educate themselves in the arguments necessary to win over no voters, accessing a vast network of sympathetic experts who are willing to give talks at local meetings, from pro-independence organisations that have continued post-referendum, such as Commonweal, Business for Scotland or Nordic Horizons. Another Scotland-wide organisation that has reinvented itself as a broader campaign group is Women for Independence. With 55 affiliated groups, WFI has successfully opposed the building of a women’s super-prison, founded uniform banks for families struggling to clothe their children, and conducted groundbreaking research on period poverty.Jonathan Shafi, co-founder of the left-aligned Radical Independence Campaign, expects there will be “a significant demoralisation” if there is no second referendum within the next few years.McAlpine believes the yes movement faces another threat with more long-lasting consequences than a public split over the timing of another referendum.“The bigger risk is drift: when it becomes clear that Sturgeon is not calling another referendum the small risk is a screaming fit, and then the media will eviscerate us for being split. But the bigger risk is that everyone will find new things to do. You can only heal wounds when the people are still in the room.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9603b429d3516f770f4ddfd33cb6055396ef307b/0_248_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bfc027befb53dff3dcebd44c0568107","title":"pmqs may corbyn brexit uk wont benefit from free trade deal with us say harvard academics politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsIn the Lords Maggie Jones, the shadow environment minister, is wrapping up the debate now for Labour. (See 4.21pm.) She says the amendment is the only way to protect the environment for future generations.And in the Commons MPs are now debating the Labour motion saying the government should publish the cabinet papers explaining its plans for a customs partnership and “maximum facilitation”, the alternative post-Brexit customs option. If passed, this would be binding because Labour is using the “humble address” mechanism.Here is the Labour motion.That an humble address be presented to Her Majesty, that she will be graciously pleased to give directions that the following papers be laid before the House: all papers, presentations and economic analyses from 1 January 2018 up to and including 16 May 2018 prepared for the European Union exit and trade (strategy and negotiations) cabinet sub-committee, and its sub-committees, on the government’s preferred post-Brexit customs arrangements including a customs partnership and maximum facilitation.Last year Labour had two good hits with “humble address” motions. It used them to demand the publication of the government’s Brexit impact assessment and universal credit project assessments. Government whips thought they would lose if the motions were put to a vote and so Tory MPs abstained, with the result that the motions were passed and the documents were handed over to select committees.But last month Labour tried to use a “humble address” to get the government to publish confidential government papers about Windrush - but failed when it lost by almost 100 votes. And again the Tories must be confident of winning again. There are a dozen or more Conservatives willing to rebel over Europe. But most MPs accept the convention that the government should be able to keep some policy advice private, Tory MPs have been briefed in outline on what the customs plans are and a white paper has been promised for next month. This is not analogous with the Brexit impact assessment situation, where some Tory MPs felt there was a cover-up. There is no evidence we’re going to see a Tory revolt tonight.In the House of Lords peers are now debating the third reading of the EU withdrawal bill.Unlike in the House of Commons, peers vote on amendments to the bill at third reading. There are various amendments tabled for debate today (see here - pdf) but the main one is one that has been tabled by Lord Krebs, a crossbencher, with Labour and Lib Dem support. It says the government must set up a body to maintain EU standards of environmental protection. The government is expected to lose when it gets put to a vote.Maggie Jones, a shadow environment minister, defends the amendment in a Labour Lords blog. Here’s an excerpt.A cross party amendment, tabled by crossbencher Lord Krebs and with formal support from myself, Conservative Lord Deben and LibDem Baroness Bakewell, seeks to set out the environmental principles that should underpin UK law post-Brexit.It should not be necessary. Last November, Mr Gove acknowledged the need to set out such principles and the remit for the statutory body which would hold public bodies to account. Then, late last week, we had first sight of a much delayed consultation document addressing these issues. Meanwhile, rumours abound that Gove has lost a battle with Cabinet colleagues on the proposed powers of the watchdog. It certainly seems that way.The document out for consultation is a bitter disappointment to NGOs and iniduals concerned about our environment standards post Brexit – particularly when we have relied on Europe to deliver for us in the past. For example, it makes it clear that the application of any principles would be subservient to other government priorities. The environment is portrayed as the enemy of growth rather than complementary and there is no understanding of the advantages of an environmental net gain principle in wider government policies.During his Commons statement Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, and a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign, repeatedly said that Labour would not be able to implement its plans to nationalise the railways under EU rules. After one Labour MP challenged him to renationalise the rail network, he replied:But is he right? Until recently the firm consensus was no, although new EU regulations would certainly make blanket nationalisation much harder to enact.Five years ago the TSSA transport union was highlighting a thinktank report saying “European rules do not dictate that railways must be fully privatised”.Last year an academic assessment of 26 Labour policy proposals concluded that EU would only have a “negligible” impact in terms of preventing a Corbyn government implementing its plans. The report was written up in a  story at the time, and here is an extract from our report.The EU has a policy that prevents a national railway monopoly, but this is to make sure a pan-European freight network thrives, which is something Labour supporters would probably back. Most European countries have a nationalised railway system.French president Emmanuel Macron recently nationalised a shipyardjointly owned with an Italian rival to prevent the domestic firm losing control. He was able to press ahead with his protectionist measure under Maastricht and Lisbon Treaty rules that leave room for policy objectives for which state aid can be considered compatible.Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s former communications director, came to the same conclusions in an article he wrote last year for the New European. He said:As a cursory glance at state-owned railways all over Europe will confirm, ownership is not a problem. Most European countries have state-owned railways. The UK is the exception, not the rule. It is true that EU law requires that infrastructure (rails, stations, etc.) be separate from the train services using them, but both can be publicly-owned or controlled, as they are in many EU countries. Railway companies from other EU countries, such as those operating services between Ireland and Northern Ireland or to and from the continent through the Channel Tunnel, are also entitled to offer services within the UK if they meet certain conditions. There is no reason why the UK could not bring private rail companies back into public ownership as their franchises expire.Recently Sabine Weyand, who is deputy to Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, made the same point on Twitter.According to Grayling’s aides, these assurances do not take into account that EU regulations have changed. Previous rules required separation of track and train. New rules, the fourth railway package, says franchises have to be put out to tender.Here is a summary of the fourth railway package. Here is the key regulation, regulation (EU) 20162338, and here is an extract.Public service contracts for public passenger transport services by rail should be awarded on the basis of a competitive tendering procedure, except for those cases set out in this Regulation. In a recent article for the House magazine Andy Tarrant, an EU and competition lawyer and an adviser to the Labour party, said that even this would not stop Labour implementing its nationalisation plans. Tarrant said:But Brexiters argue that, in practice, it might not be that simple, because EU state aid rules could get in the way. This is from an article by David Scullion, deputy editor at BrexitCentral.Under the new rules, it will be technically possible to have a state monopoly on rail, if rail franchises are subject to competition and state-controlled bodies manage to win every contract.But under this system, the government could comply with the new legislation but be caught out by EU state aid rules, which happened to the French government when it tried to maintain a state monopoly on rail.In order to comply with the 4th Railway Package the French split up their state-owned railway SNCF into separate entities, SNCF Mobilités (operations and trains) and SNCF Réseau (infrastructure manager), both of which were wholly owned by the state railway SNCF (EPIC).But the plan failed to comply with EU rules on state aid and a recent ECJ judgement found similar structures in France were not compliant.Subsequently, a review commissioned by the French government recommended that both companies (Mobilités and Réseau) should be privatised.In the Commons MPs are now debating a Labour motion on the Grenfell Tower fire which, among other things, calls upon the government to honour its promise to permanently rehouse all the survivors by 14 June, the first anniversary of the disaster.James Brokenshire, the new housing secretary, told the Commons that not all survivors would be rehoused within 12 months. As the Press Association reports, he said of the 210 households in need of a new home, 201 have accepted offers of temporary or permanent accommodation. Of this number 138 have moved in, 64 into temporary accommodation and 74 into permanent accommodation. Brokenshire said:While progress has been made, there is no question that this has been too slow. As a result, some households will still be in emergency accommodation in June.It was always going to be a challenge to respond to an unprecedented tragedy on this scale, it has taken time to purchase suitable homes, adapt and refurbish them to meet people’s needs and the higher safety standards, but this is clearly not good enough. It is understandable the community will feel disappointed and let down. I too am very concerned, especially to see people who accepted an offer of a permanent home still living in emergency accommodation. I am therefore establishing at pace what further action can be done by the government or by the council to speed up this process. The council now has over 300 properties available to those who need them, and my department will continue to work with the council to ensure people are given whatever support they need to be rehoused as swiftly as possible.Jeff Silvester, the chief operating officer of AggregateIQ, is giving evidence to the Commons culture committee as part of its fake news inquiry.AggregateIQ worked for Vote Leave during the EU referendum campaign and has been implicated in the Cambridge AnalyticaFacebook data and referendum spending controversy.My colleague Carole Cadwalladr wrote about the firm here.You can watch the hearing here.And here is the written evidence to the committee submitted by the firm (pdf).Both of the customs options that are on the table could potentially be made to work. There is no doubt that a customs partnership hybrid model makes the Irish border situation easier, there is no doubt that the question of the Irish border is resolved by the customs partnership in an easier way than maximum facilitation.We have been investing in terms of money, legal powers and capabilities for a long time. That means that we are able to contribute heavily to the security of our European friends. We benefit from that as well but we contribute a great deal. Probably, I would say, the biggest contribution of any of the countries in the European Union.Conservative MPs will be whipped to vote against Labour’s Commons motion demanding the release of cabinet documents relating to the government’s two proposed options for post-Brexit customs arrangements, the Press Association reports. A Downing Street source said: We will be opposing the motion. It is a long-held and important principle that cabinet ministers are able to receive candid advice from civil servants and it is important that the confidentiality of that advice remains.Here is the full text of Chris Grayling’s statement.And here is the news release from the Department for Transport.Aslef, the train drivers’ union, has welcomed Chris Grayling’s East Coast announcement. This is from its general secretary, Mick Whelan.We welcome the decision by the secretary of state for transport today to bring the East Coast back into public ownership – at least temporarily, using the vehicle of directly operated railways ltd – and hope that he will now bring the rest of our railways back into public ownership, too.Because this is the third time in ten years that a private company has messed up on the east coast main line. When it was run in the public sector, it returned more than £1bn to the Treasury.It’s important that staff, and passengers, are properly protected while, once again, the transport secretary tries to patch up a failing franchise system that everyone knows doesn’t work. Britain’s railways should be run, successfully, as a public service, not for private profit. Because they cannot do it.It’s only sad that Tory dogma – wedded to the failed model of privatisation – means they will return this line to the private sector, doubtless to fail again, in the not too distant future.Labour’s John Mann says when people in his constituency voted for Brexit, one of the advantages was the government would be able to renationalise the railways. Why won’t Grayling take advantage of that?Grayling says if you take the rail service into public control, and starve it of capital, passengers will be worse off."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02a94e36afe741ce2174b3475536cb264edea0bd/0_0_5446_3271/master/5446.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd65aeda5b65aa6c8735886a47ea49e","title":"right thing to do guernsey begins assisted dying debate","story":"Demonstrations mark start of island’s parliamentary debate on legalising euthanasiaThe chief minister of Guernsey has called for some terminally-ill people to be given access to assisted dying as he opened a debate that could pave the way for euthanasia being legalised on the island.Beginning the debate in the island’s parliament, Gavin St Pier argued that increasing rights of autonomy and self-determination – including choosing one’s manner and time of death – was the “right thing to do”. He called for Guernsey to follow the example of US states such as Oregon, where adults with mental capacity and who have only six months to live are able to opt for assisted dying.Should the 40-strong parliament, called the States of Deliberation, back the proposal, a detailed consultation will be carried out. The Channel island would become the only place in the British Isles to legalise assisted dying if the bill passes into law.As a British crown dependency, Guernsey makes its own laws. St Pier’s proposal is a requête, which is similar to a private member’s bill in Westminster.There were demonstrations from groups both in favour of and against assisted dying at the start of the debate, which is likely to carry on into Thursday and even Friday. There were howls of protest from supporters of assisted dying when one member of the parliament, deputy Jan Kuttelwascher, confronted them: “If you want to kill yourself you can do so now. I just don’t agree with the idea of involving a third party, who happens to be a medical practitioner.” He added: “There’s a number of people I’d love to assist in dying, but they’d object.”The start of the debate, which is being watched around the world, was more sober.St Pier said: “We have medicalised the dying process. Very few of us will experience a natural death. Most of us will have a managed death. In most cases there will be a point in which healthcare providers will make key decisions on our behalf with or without prior input from our families or ourselves. One of those decisions may have an impact on the time of our deaths.” He added: “It is often said that this is an immensely complex moral, ethical and legal issue. But at its heart is a very simple principle – that of autonomy and the right to self-determination.”St Pier said laws around orce, same-sex marriage and contraception had given people more right to self-determination. Each change had been resisted and branded a “slippery slope”.“Increased rights of autonomy and self-determination is self evidently the right thing to do even if we disagree with the choices made and never choose to exercise those rights ourselves. So it is with assisted dying.” If euthanasia is made legal in Guernsey, the move is likely to reignite the debate in the UK, three years after Westminster MPs decisively rejected a bill that would have allowed doctors to help terminally-ill people end their lives. Similar legislation to that in Oregon has been passed in six other US states, as well as in Canada and the Australian state of Victoria. New Zealand is also considering legislation. The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have more permissive laws, based on applicants’ suffering but not requiring a terminal diagnosis.If the law is passed, there would be a report and further votes before assisted dying became legal, with the process probably taking at least three years, according to St Pier. Any law would need privy council approval and, possibly, legislative change in Westminster to avoid medical professionals practising in Guernsey being prosecuted under UK law.Opposition to the proposal has been led by churches, the British Medical Association and the Guernsey Disabilities Alliance.

The first set flew by in 19 minutes (her third bagel in three years here), the second about twice as long, when the Taipei veteran broke twice then faded.Konta needed a convincing win after a few jitters in her two-set win over Magdalena Rybarikova on Monday. Next up she plays the combative fifth seed, Jelena Ostapenko, who went through to the third round by beating Shuai Zhang 6-2, 7-5 on day two.In their only meeting, Konta beat Ostapenko 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 on the Eastbourne grass last summer. But the 20-year-old Latvian is a different proposition on clay, having beaten Simona Halep to win the French Open last year.On Wednesday, Konta’s serve again was sharp, winning her the point 24 of 32 first efforts, but dipping to 33 per cent on second serve. She is moving well and looks superbly fit.Elsewhere on day three, there were entertaining contretemps on Court Pietrangeli, where sixth seed Karolina Pliskova was so incensed by a poor line call in the penultimate game of her three-set loss to the up-and-coming Maria Sakkari that she battered the side of the umpire’s chair.Sakkari, advised by Kyle Edmund’s agent, Laurence Frankopan, and briefly coached by Mark Petchey last year, stunned Pliskova to win 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.Halep, meanwhile, completed a 6-0, 6–1 rout of Naomi Osaka in less than an hour. Osaka, who defeated the Romanian on the way to her first WTA title at Indian Wells in March, was overwhelmed by the top seed at the Italian Open, who now faces Madison Keys.In the men’s draw there was a straightforward win for Rafael Nadal, who defeated Damir Džumhur 6–0, 6–1.

It is a field in which we are absolutely world class. From the FA to the RFU to the ECB to the Jockey Club and far beyond, we really bring home the bacon. All the cured pork, in fact. Of all the games we invented, this is the last one we can always be sure of\u0026nbspwinning.And yet, even by the high standards of his peers, the England and Wales Cricket Board chairman, Colin Graves, is having an excellent run. I think the clinching factor is how much Colin clearly seems to hate cricket. In one sense, even that’s not weird. All populists secretly hate their people. All bookies secretly hate their punters. And all sports blazers secretly hate their sport. You only have to look at Gianni Infantino’s sporticidal plans for a 48-team World Cup, and ever more competitive black-tie award ceremonies, to see a similar tendency.But the common thread is that they tend to do it secretly. Colin’s distaste for cricket appears ever more open. How else to read his comments to the BBC’s Simon Mann on Monday? Colin was justifying The Hundred, a highly uncalled-for fourth format of the game he seems bent on driving through, despite vocal resistance from the Professional Cricketers’ Association, many players past and present, and a demographic we’ll call “members of the public who like cricket”.He is doing this, he reasoned, because cricket as we know it has nothing to offer young people. “The younger generation, whether you like it or not, are just not attracted to cricket,” Colin explained. “They want something different. They want it to be more exciting. They want it shorter. They want it simpler to understand.”Before he makes a dash for the lawyers – of which more later – I should say it is perfectly possible Colin doesn’t realise he dislikes cricket at all. He almost certainly believes he loves it. That might be his tragedy. It is likely that his antipathy towards cricket is wholly subconscious, buried beneath that monogram-gated exterior. It is up to you to speculate quite how many – or quite how few – hours Colin would need on the couch of a Viennese-school psychoanalyst to tease out the possibility. Or, to keep an open mind, for the shrink to come up with another credible explanation as to why he\u0026nbsphas frequently disparaged the appeal of various forms of the game. It wasn’t long into his tenure at the ECB before he was describing the record ticket-selling T20 Blast competition as “mediocre”. So he has form for tipping on the ECB’s own products, to use the parlance of\u0026nbspour times.Yet the more contradictory positions that emanate from the ECB, the harder it is to shake the feeling that if it isn’t happening in the immediate vicinity of the chairman’s walnut gearknobbed saloon, he isn’t powerfully aware of it. Colin’s interview aired on the very day the ECB announced that 50,000 youngsters have signed up to participate in its All Stars Cricket initiative this summer. Never mind knowing what the other is doing – is the ECB’s right hand even in the same time zone as its left hand?I’m reminded of Alan Partridge ringing his son and being appalled to discover where he is. “Fernando,” he despairs, “you’re 22 years old and you’re spending your Saturday afternoon in bed with a girl. You’re wasting your life.” And so with Colin’s declaration coming on the day of the All Stars news. Kids, you’re squandering your youth with this stuff! Have you tried football instead?Alas, Colin’s tenure has already become too much for some. As ECB board member Andy Nash put it in his resignation letter a few weeks ago: “I’ve recently become\u0026nbspconcerned that the standards of corporate governance at ECB are falling well short of what’s acceptable and in all conscience, I can’t allow myself to continue to be associated with it. I would be failing in my\u0026nbspduty as a director if I didn’t bring these to the board’s attention and this I’ve tried to do.”What can one say? Not a lot, if the lawyers have anything to do with it. His regime is already reportedly suing ESPNcricinfo’s George Dobell. Other threats of a trip down the Strand seem likely. They might even sue over Nash’s resignation letter, who knows? After the Mann interview, Graves might be considering suing Glamorgan for the time-bending feat of pre-contradicting him. By way of recap, Graves said on Monday of the suggestion the ECB compensated counties for the years they miss out on staging a Test: “No payments have been made to counties at all.” Yet Glamorgan stated in March: “Following discussions with the ECB the club decided not to apply to host Test matches during the 2020 to 2024 period in return for a compensation payment of £2.5m.”As for the continuing point of Colin Graves, it is a matter of increasing speculation. He might well be a form\u0026nbspof blazered Terminator, sent back in time with the sole mission of throwing former ECB chairman Giles Clarke into sympathetic relief. Either way, his innovation\u0026nbsphas more and more vocal detractors. Whatever the broadcasters might prefer, most believe that the various forms of the game we already have just need a little TLC. Which is to say: Colin is chasing waterfalls, when he really should stick to the rivers and the lakes that he’s used to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d47f477f57a3d705b72a4dc3dc6b9c956266c1f7/0_203_3926_2355/master/3926.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b95e16bc5be42e76d741e9c229d465d7","title":"nicaragua latest daniel ortega talks student leaders","story":"The talks come nearly a month after public upset over social security reforms. At least 65 people have been killed so farNicaragua’s beleaguered president, Daniel Ortega, will hold talks with student leaders and civil society representatives on Wednesday, hoping to defuse weeks of unrest and deadly repression in which scores have been killed. The talks, which are being mediated by the Catholic church at a seminary in the capital, Managua, come nearly a month after public rage over social security reforms erupted into the biggest political challenge to the former Marxist revolutionary since his return to power in 2007. Initial demonstrations over that unpopular move swelled into a broader, nationwide revolt against Ortega’s 11-year rule after they were met with lethal repression by pro-government forces. According to human rights groups, at least 65 people, many of them student protesters, have been killed so far. In an editorial marking the start of Wednesday’s talks, the opposition broadsheet La Prensa urged Ortega’s critics to give the dialogue a chance, despite fears the “cunning and unscrupulous” politician would outwit them. It called on opposition representatives to demand an immediate suspension of government repression and a commitment that no more students would be killed. “The dialogue must focus on the two key points which are: achieving justice for those who were massacred … and agreeing to a plan and a roadmap for the process of Nicaragua’s democratization,” La Prensa said. But protesters – many of whom are now adamant that their Sandinista president must go – said they were doubtful the dialogue would bring any lasting solution. “People now want him out,” said Xilonem Vargas, a 27-year-old protester from Masaya, a city to the south-east of Managua that suffered some of the most recent deadly violence on Saturday. “Now the main chants are: ‘Let’s get Daniel Ortega out! There is no other option. We cannot dialogue with a murderer.’“We just don’t know what is going to happen. Everyone is acting very unpredictably,” Vargas added. Istvan Sepúlveda, a 31-year-old protester from the western city of León, said he welcomed the prospect of a “ceasefire” but feared the talks would make it easier for the government to paint those who continued to take to the streets as troublemakers. Unlike many members of the student-led protests, Sepúlveda said he was not convinced the immediate exit of Ortega, and his wife and vice-president, Rosario Murillo, was a good idea. “If they leave there is going to be a power vacuum and that could be even worse.”However, he said Ortega needed to offer genuine concessions this week, including justice for those slain by security forces and a commitment to transparent and democratic elections in the future. “If not, I think the protests will continue and might even intensify … It’s been like a pressure cooker and now it has reached boiling point,” Sepúlveda added. Speaking on the eve of the dialogue, Managua’s archbishop, Leopoldo Brenes, admitted conditions for the talks were not ideal, with protests and violence continuing. “I ask all those who, in one way or another, are in a position to stop this situation, to do so as soon as possible so we can avoid any more deaths,” Brenes added.

Nuns should also pay close attention to “online content and the type and quantity of information”, it added. The guidelines come three weeks after a group of cloistered nuns in Spain published protests on Facebook after a court acquitted five men accused of the gang-rape of a teenager during the Pamplona bull-running festival in 2016, finding them guilty of the lesser offence of sexual abuse.The post attracted 14,000 likes and was shared more than 15,000 times. Pope Francis has paved the way for more open use of social media, attracting 17.7 million followers to his @Pontifex Twitter account since it was created in 2013.The most famous Italian nun on social media is possibly Sister Cristina Scuccia, who won Italy’s version of The Voice in 2014.

Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Speaking on The  Inside Politics podcast, Fianna Fáil TD Lisa Chambers said agreeing to the proposal would weaken Ireland’s negotiating position. Ms Chambers also said the Irish government had been “too nice” in negotiations. “I think we’ve been far too facilitative of the Tory infighting that’s going on and we’re allowing it to drag on to the detriment of our own country,” she said. “We are supportive of the Irish Government’s attempts to secure a good deal for Ireland, but that support is conditional on them doing a good job”. ‘Max fac’ refers to the use of technology to minimise friction at the border if Britain leaves the EU customs union. ‘Max fac plus delay’ envisages a period during which Britain remains in the customs union, or something similar to it, while the technological infrastructure needed for ‘max fac’ to work is developed. The proposal is reportedly being considered by Prime Minister Theresa May, whose Cabinet is riven over how to solve the question of the Irish border and Britain’s customs relationship with the EU post-Brexit.As a June summit with the European Council draws near, May is under pressure to find a workable approach that is agreeable to Dublin, Brussels and hardliners within her party such as Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. Speaking on The  Inside Politics podcast, Ms Chambers said ‘max fac plus delay’ would “lead to a border”, and that EU support for Ireland’s position may be weaker at a point in the future when the terms of that border were being finalised. “Who does it suit? It doesn’t suit us. The (June council meeting) deadline is there to put pressure on the UK to get off the fence, make a decision and for Theresa May to show some leadership on this issue”.“What happens when the delay period is over? It suits the British government to kick this can down the road”. Inside Politics is a regular podcast from The .

This is a deeply complex and sensitive issue.”RTÉ has confirmed it received numerous complaints about the debate, which aired on Monday night.Meanwhile, Tánaiste Simon Coveney has confirmed he is willing to debate the referendum on the Eighth Amendment with members of the No side.Mr Coveney said he believes the best approach is to provide people with facts to allow voters make informed decisions ahead of the referendum.The Tánaiste has been canvassing, he said, and doing a number of interviews on the subject. “What we have been trying to do is to persuade people through reassurance and facts, as opposed to having arguments that make headlines.“That is what we will continue to do. The Government want to have a respectful debate and conversation with the country that reassures people who are undecided.”Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has confirmed he will not take part in debates but will take part in a number of media interviews.The Tánaiste and Minister for Health were speaking at an event outlining a number of measures the Government is taking to improve supports for women and to reduce crisis pregnancies.The measures include a comprehensive education, information and promotion programme, as well as an extension to the availability and distribution of free barrier contraception.Mr Harris said this will be supported by a co-ordinated and integrated approach to sexual health promotion which will support “safer sex” behaviours, increase awareness of risks and promote testing, counselling and other services.Get the latest news and best analysis ahead of the Eighth Amendment referendum here-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3496545.1526408830!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no campaign defends booklet resembling official publication","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“We have laid out what we think is the most important part of the Government’s proposals,” says spokesman for the Save the Eighth group, John McGuirkThe Save the Eighth campaign has defended a booklet delivered to 200,000 households which has the appearance of an official Government publication.The green booklet, entitled Your Guide to the Referendum – Information on the Government’s Proposals, looks like an official Government publication but instead contains arguments put forward by the No side, likely to be disputed by Yes campaigners.The booklet warns that “unborn babies at all stages of pregnancy will have no constitutional rights, and you will never have a say on this again.”The booklet also proposes an alternative “plan for life” which it says the Government will be “forced to consider” if the referendum is defeated. It includes several measures including “new financial support for mothers” and “free childcare from birth”.It also includes statements from anti-abortion obstetricians disputing the suggestion that the Eighth Amendment has negatively impacted on the treatment of women in pregnancy.According to small print on the penultimate page, the booklet is “published by, and sponsors include, Family and Life, Life Institute, www.save8.ie, www.protectthe8th.ie, Coalition Against Abortion on Demand.”The spokesman for the Save the Eighth group John McGuirk said that 200,000 copies of the booklet had been distributed in areas where the group felt there is a large proportion of undecideds.He said that research had shown that that there was still a high level of confusion about the nature of the Government’s proposals which would follow a repeal of the Eighth Amendment.“We have laid out what we think is the most important part of the Government’s proposals,” he said.Asked if the booklet was masquerading as an official Government publication, Mr McGuirk disputed this.“I don’t think it does,” he said. “It states, this is what you’re being asked to vote on . . .

They had designed a long floor-skimming evening dress in sparkling red crimson which was supposed to look like a mosaic of a stained glass window. But in a last minute change, the modern-day style icon decided to appear with a a metallic bustier, Audrey Hepburn-style cigarette trousers and a billowing floral train. The outfit was designed by Richard Quinn, a British designer whose botanical prints had even won over royalty: The Queen appeared in the front row of his London fashion week in February this year. Ford’s fashion designers were notified of the change by Mrs Clooney. They were reportedly not pleased, but accepted her choice to go with another designer. But the team also said that they would prefer Mrs Clooney not to wear the dress at all, so that another star could have shown it at another glamorous event.The mild reaction apparntly turned furious, though, when they discovered that Mrs Clooney had ignored their request and wore their dress the same night, May 7, for a more private after party.Vogue editor and chair of the event, Anna Wintour. said on The Late Show that Mrs Clooney insisted on stopping at the politan Museum\u0027s gift shop to change the dress and wear Tom Ford’s gown.Wintour also said that she pushed the star to stick to the main plan in order to avoid diplomatic embarrassment, given that Mrs Clooney was co-chair of this year\u0027s Met Gala and had also appeared on the May cover of Vogue. Please review our commenting policyDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourComment: Jeremy Corbyn may have won PMQs – but he doesn’t see what a risk he’s takingRail commuters to lose up to a third of scheduled services under timetable revolution, campaigners claimComment: The Bank of England\u0026#39s menopausal moment is a lesson in how not to use metaphors Fighting chronic diseases could save 8m lives and $350bn in developing countries Horse-trekking centre shuts because riders were too overweightComment: If Donald Trump wants a successful deal with North Korea, the US has to stop using the Libya exampleWarning over \u0026#39appetite suppressant\u0026#39 lollipops advertised by Instagram celebrities as they send \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 message to young girlsUK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearRoyal wedding 2018 latest news: Full details for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriageSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerComment: Sorry is not the hardest word for Donald Trump.

And it seems they will waste no time getting started.The newlyweds\u0027 royal wedding schedule sees them undertake a tour of Windsor as their first trip as man and wife, to greet well-wishers who are expected to turn out from all over the world to see them.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about how to watch it and where to stand.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will undertake a carriage ride through Windsor straight after the St George’s Chapel ceremony and before their reception. The journey is designed to allow members of the public to see the newlyweds in person while they are still dressed in their finery, in what is likely to be one of the most photographed occasions of the year.Such a display of ceremonial prowess has been used by kings and queens for centuries to celebrate as much as it has been used to impress their subjects and foreign powers. Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleKilauea volcano eruption: Before and after photos capture scale of devastating lava damage in HawaiiDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourComment: Jeremy Corbyn may have won PMQs – but he doesn’t see what a risk he’s takingRail commuters to lose up to a third of scheduled services under timetable revolution, campaigners claimComment: The Bank of England\u0026#39s menopausal moment is a lesson in how not to use metaphors Fighting chronic diseases could save 8m lives and $350bn in developing countries Amal Clooney \u0026#39upsets\u0026#39 designer Tom Ford with Met Gala outfit swapHorse-trekking centre shuts because riders were too overweightComment: If Donald Trump wants a successful deal with North Korea, the US has to stop using the Libya exampleWarning over \u0026#39appetite suppressant\u0026#39 lollipops advertised by Instagram celebrities as they send \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 message to young girlsUK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearRoyal wedding 2018 latest news: Full details for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriageSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerComment: Sorry is not the hardest word for Donald Trump.

Full royal wedding schedule and timingsHow to watch the royal wedding this SaturdayWho has designed Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding dress? Every runner and rider decodedThe hotly anticipated Royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is now just three days away, taking place this Saturday 19 May. However a last-minute setback has called the couple\u0027s plans into confusion, as Ms Markle\u0027s father Thomas announced via US celebrity website TMZ that he is due to have an operation and will not attend the ceremony on Saturday.Yet the wheels for the wedding are still in motion, with the couple promising a wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.So what\u0027s in store for the couple – and how are the final plans affected by this week\u0027s changes? Here are all the latest updates about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. He was also intending to walk Ms Markle down the aisle on Saturday, meeting her at the chapel\u0027s west door after her drive to the ceremony with her mother.But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, the 73-year-old said on Monday he would avoid the ceremony for fear of embarrassing his daughter.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.However, on Tuesday he raised hopes of attending after all by saying his daughter had been in touch to reassure him, and was prepared to fly to Britain if his medical condition allowed.Mr Markle is reported to have said: “I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But within hours he appeared to change his plans for a third time, claiming he required heart surgery after falling unwell again.Meanwhile, other members of Ms Markle\u0027s family have arrived in London - depsite reportedly not receiving an invite to the wedding.Tracy Dooley – who was married to Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr – was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26 on Monday.Ms Dooley, who has admitted she has not seen Ms Markle for 20 years, has previously told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday.Yet she is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she will be in the front row cheering them on in Windsor.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsKensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.On Wednesday, it was announced the bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren. The pageboys are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.Royal siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Prince Harry has paid tribute to former mentor and close friend Mark Dyer by requesting his son Jasper as a pageboy, while Ms Markle has publicly recognised one of her best friends, stylist Jessica Mulroney, by choosing her twin sons to take part in the wedding.Read more about the pageboys and bridesmaids here.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.The couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.Peonies are one of Ms Markle\u0027s favourite flowers, so it is likely her floral bouquet will include these fragrant blooms, which are in season in May.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourComment: Jeremy Corbyn may have won PMQs – but he doesn’t see what a risk he’s takingRail commuters to lose up to a third of scheduled services under timetable revolution, campaigners claimComment: The Bank of England\u0026#39s menopausal moment is a lesson in how not to use metaphors Fighting chronic diseases could save 8m lives and $350bn in developing countries Amal Clooney \u0026#39upsets\u0026#39 designer Tom Ford with Met Gala outfit swapHorse-trekking centre shuts because riders were too overweightComment: If Donald Trump wants a successful deal with North Korea, the US has to stop using the Libya exampleWarning over \u0026#39appetite suppressant\u0026#39 lollipops advertised by Instagram celebrities as they send \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 message to young girlsUK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerComment: Sorry is not the hardest word for Donald Trump.

He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.The procession is expected to take 25 minutes, 10 minutes longer than a similar procession taken by Edward and Sophie in 1999.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourComment: Jeremy Corbyn may have won PMQs – but he doesn’t see what a risk he’s takingRail commuters to lose up to a third of scheduled services under timetable revolution, campaigners claimComment: The Bank of England\u0026#39s menopausal moment is a lesson in how not to use metaphors Fighting chronic diseases could save 8m lives and $350bn in developing countries Amal Clooney \u0026#39upsets\u0026#39 designer Tom Ford with Met Gala outfit swapHorse-trekking centre shuts because riders were too overweightComment: If Donald Trump wants a successful deal with North Korea, the US has to stop using the Libya exampleWarning over \u0026#39appetite suppressant\u0026#39 lollipops advertised by Instagram celebrities as they send \u0026#39toxic\u0026#39 message to young girlsUK weather: Royal wedding could be on the hottest day of the yearRoyal wedding 2018 latest news: Full details for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriageSt George\u0026#39s Chapel: Inside the Windsor Castle venue for the royal weddingRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The yoga teacher, the diplomat and the cannabis farmerComment: Sorry is not the hardest word for Donald Trump.

The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flourishes are being added to the wedding gown. For those of us not lucky enough to be on the guest list or among the members of the public invited to Windsor, the next best option is to watch live from home. As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. The schedule for the royal day means you can expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go...

The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC\u0027s coverage will run from 9am until 2pm on Saturday.

Or, you know, just google it.Jokes aside, this is actually a good question. The sun sets at marginally different times across the country – a minute later in Newcastle than in Sunderland and a whole half an hour earlier in London than Edinburgh.This is important because breaking the fast even a minute too early could render the day invalid, so it’s vital for hungry families who are counting down the minutes to know precisely when the moment comes. Fasting is not supposed to hinder your health, so anyone with a pre-existing medical condition likely to fall ill as a result of the fast is not expected to adhere to it.It is for this reason that children, those on prescription medicines, the infirm and elderly, pregnant women and those on their period are not required to participate.Not between the hours of sunrise and sunset, no sir.Yeah all day. Nothing at all. Zilch. Zero. Just that sweet oxygen. It’s common for Muslims to treat themselves to a few farewell rounds of their favourite dishes before Ramadan begins but, after that, it’s very much a matter of personal preference.Some go for soups, salad and dates while others are partial to samosas and kebabs. Those who indulge with a hearty blowout are setting themselves up for a much worse bout of hunger the next day so many prefer to eat moderately.Overdoing it with hot or salty foods, meanwhile, can leave you badly dehydrated and given that you can’t drink water the following day...That’s the idea.Absolutely not. There’s a strong expectation that all non-Muslims must refrain from eating in the company of a fasting Muslim.Doing otherwise is regarded as grossly offensive and insensitive.Oh yes. Every time a non-Muslim eats during Ramadan, a fairy dies of sadness and then bursts into flames.This is a contentious issue but some say as long as you’re not actually devouring Colgate by the tube, it’s fine.However some devout Muslims feel uneasy about the practice and prefer to brush with a finely-fibred miswak twig instead.Don’t be an idiot.In pictures: Ramadan around the worldIn pictures: Ramadan around the worldRussian Muslims pray outside the central mosque in Moscow, during celebrations of Eid al-Fitr marking the end of the fasting month of RamadanTurkish Muslims offer Eid al Fitr prayers as they mark the first day of the Eid al-Fitr at Fatih Sultan Mosque in IstanbulA Syrian Dervish dances as part of a traditional event organised by the Syrian Ministry of Tourism under the title \u0027Music and Dervishes\u0027 in the old city of DamascusA Bosnian Muslim man, wearing a traditional Bosnian outfit, fires a canon from a vantage point overlooking Sarajevo to mark the end of daily fasting on the final day of the Islamic holy month of RamadanA general view of an illuminated Mosque as Muslims pray during the 27th night of Ramadan, in PeshawarMuslim women offer prayer of the Jumat-ul-wida, the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan at a mosque in LahoreMuslims offer prayers on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan in Dargah Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti The Prophet Mohammed Mosque in the holy city of Medina, during Ramadan A Malaysian swings around fireworks to celebrate the last day of the Muslims\u0027 Holy fasting month of Ramadan, in Shah Alam, outside Kuala LumpurKyrgyz Muslims pray during the Eid al-Fitr Muslim celebration marking the end of Ramadan in BishkekPeople pray during the Laylat Al Qadr prayers on the 27th day of the Islamic month of fasting, Ramadan in the front of the Aghin mosque in AbidjanSyrians shop for traditional sweets in Kafr Batna in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area, on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, ahead of Eid al-Fitr which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of RamadanA Palestinian woman prays on the third Friday of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u0027s Old CityIranian Shiite Muslims pray at the graves of soldiers who were killed during 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, during the holy fasting month of Ramadan, just outside Tehran, IranA Palestinian man pours water on Muslim worshippers\u0027 heads to cool off in the heat, as others pray outside the Dome of the Rock at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the last Friday prayers of the Muslim holy month of RamadanAfghan women wait to receive food ration during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in HeratA Pakistani Muslim reads the holy Koran as he observes Itikaf at a Mosque, in PeshawarKashmiri Muslim women offer prayers as the head priest (not pictured) displays a holy relic believed to be hair from the beard of the Prophet Mohammed, during special prayers to observe the Martyr Day of Hazrat Ali, cousin of Prophet Mohammed, on the 21st day of Ramadan, at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirIndian Muslims sit with bowls of porridge(Nombu kanji)as they prepare to break the fast with the Iftar meal during the Islamic month of Ramadan at The Wallajah Big Mosque in Chennai Spectators watch fireworks as a giant Fanous, or Ramadan lantern, is switched on four days before the start of Ramadan month in front of Mohamed al-Amine Mosque in downtown BeirutLebanese children perform during activities celebrating the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in downtown BeirutPalestinian men drink tea on the promenade of Gaza beach Members of Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Muslim organisation in Indonesia, hold a mass prayer session to welcome in Ramadan in Jakarta Iraqis shop for food in a preparation for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in BaghdadFoods is seen during \u0027Unggah-unggahan\u0027 ceremony to welcome in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in Pekuncen villageIn the short term, yes, you might do, depending on how much you consume in the evenings.But given that your metabolism quickly adjusts to your calorie intake, you will quickly put the pounds back on afterwards when you return to your usual dietary regime.Looking beach-ready is not really the main goal of this solemn observance anyway.

Remember, this is a man who has intentionally tried to live on his own away from anyone he knows.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announce their engagement.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Crown Liquor Saloon, Belfast during their visit to Northern Ireland.

Thomas says he doesn\u0027t even drink beer ... he was buying it for the guards at the place where he lives.One commentator, Jane Merrick, the former political editor of The Independent on Sunday, has described this process as “attempting to tame the media”, and noted how it is often done in vain.As well as explaining himself to TMZ, Mr Markle revealed that he was in physical, as well as emotional pain.He said he had suffered a heart attack six days earlier, but had checked himself out of the hospital because, before the Mail on Sunday reported, he had been hoping to go to the wedding.The next episode was delivered later the same day.Mr Markle told TMZ he was going back to hospital because he was suffering serious chest pains.  And he knew who to blame.“He says the pains have been triggered by emotional upset,” TMZ reported.  “He specifically mentioned his oldest daughter, Samantha Grant, who has been shading Meghan in the weeks leading up to the wedding.“Thomas tells us, ‘I\u0027ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.’”Enter, then, Samantha Grant, mother-of-three, 53-year-old former actress and model rendered wheelchair-bound by multiple sclerosis, the half-sister of Meghan Markle.Exactly how well Samantha knows Meghan is a matter of some debate.  Samantha says she “helped raise” Meghan for 12 years when they were growing up in California other reports have claimed that however close they were in childhood, Meghan has not seen Samantha or any of her half-siblings for more than a decade.Be that as it may, Samantha felt qualified enough to announce in April 2017 that she would be writing a memoir sensitively entitled: “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister”. Although it would, of course, be nothing like “some sort of slamming ‘tell-all’.”Instead, Samantha promised, she would “go through and recount some of the beautiful nuances of our lives, our family home.”These “beautiful nuances” were presumably nothing to with what happened in January when Samantha was quoted as responding to Meghan being photographed in a £56,000 designer dress by saying: “If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad.”Other apparent “shading” that may have upset Meghan and Samantha’s father came when the older half-sister realised she was not getting an invitation to the wedding.Last month Samantha reportedly tweeted: “Smoke and mirrors cannot hide the elephant in the room.“Out of respect and humanitarianism, the Markles should be invited if 2,000 complete strangers are.Our uncle, brother, me, best friend of 30 years, nephews. Our issue is not a matter of closeness. Family is family.Nor, if the gossip site TMZ can be believed, was Samantha the only one of Thomas Markle’s children to have upset him with comments about Meghan.As slowly became clear over the course of Tuesday.The morning episode had Mr Markle telling TMZ of a change of mind bought on by Meghan texting him to say she loved him and was concerned for his health.This, Mr Markle said, persuaded him that he should go to the wedding after all: Of course I\u0027d walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I\u0027d like to be a part of history.But then came the Tuesday afternoon instalment: Mr Markle wouldn’t be going to the wedding, he would be having heart surgery at 3.30pm UK time on Wednesday. TMZ reported that the doctors had discovered that the heart attack had done significant damage.And then the website added a killer line: “BTW, Thomas also says he believes the open letter his son, Thomas Jr, wrote to Prince Harry discouraging him from marrying Meghan is what triggered his heart attack.”This was a reference to the letter written by Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, a 51-year-old glass fitter who last year hit the headlines for being arrested after an alleged drunken argument with his girlfriend.In a letter sprinkled with spelling mistakes and published by celebrity gossip magazine In Touch on May 2, Thomas Markle Jr appeared to tell Prince Harry it was not too late to cancel the wedding.Meghan, the half-brother seemingly told Harry, was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.”Somewhat improbably, Markle Jr seems to have followed up with a second letter, published by In Touch on May 11, which quoted him as suggesting to Meghan: “It’s not too late to send me an invite.”Slightly different in tone to the first message, this letter reminisced about “some great holidays together, even though we all didn’t share the same house”.As this suggests, mixing with what seemed perilously close to being the personal tragedy of Mr Markle senior, there was a strong element of farce.By Tuesday afternoon the sense of a circus had been completed by reports of bookmakers offering odds on who would walk Meghan down the aisle and by a cameo appearance from former tabloid editor Piers Morgan telling Samantha Grant she was a “media vulture”.And then more of Meghan’s extended family turned up.Tracy Dooley, the ex-wife of Thomas Markle Jr, arrived at Heathrow airport from Oregon accompanied by her sons Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26.Meghan hadn’t invited her.  Ms Dooley, a florist who orced Thomas Markle Jr in 2001, has previously admitted she has not seen the bride-to-be for 20 years.But it was reported that the Dooleys had been recruited by ITV’s Good Morning Britain as “special correspondents” to report on the wedding from Windsor.ITV has yet to respond to The Independent’s request for comment on whether this is true, but the newspapers have reported that the Dooleys are thought be staying at a £70-a-night hotel in Waterloo, while Tyler has posted images on social media with the comment: “Just touched down in London!!! Man what a journey so far.”The Daily Mail informed its readers that Tyler works as a cannabis farmer in Oregon, where marijuana is legal, and is planning to bring out a new blend called “Markle’s Sparkle”.Meghan Markle\u0027s extended family have been attracting headlines for all the wrong reasons(Getty Images)The royals may have defects of their own, but one is tempted to ask whether, with a family like hers, Meghan needs enemies.Meghan Markle\u0027s father may have staged paparazzi photosMeghan Markle\u0027s brother pens a second letter asking for an invite Prince Harry says paparazzi took photos of Diana dying in Paris tunnelThe sadness and farce alike are perhaps only intensified by the suspicion that despite all the column inches devoted to it – with this article as guilty as any other – this may be a soap opera served up for the amusement of a public that is only half-interested.A YouGov poll published as Tuesday’s stories unfolded suggested that 66 per cent of the British public were “not interested” in the royal wedding.Prince Harry’s precise thoughts as he prepares for what should be the unalloyed joy of his wedding can only be guessed at.  His anger at the paparazzi who hounded his mother, however, is well known.After Diana’s death, of course, there were solemn promises all round that nothing similar would ever be allowed to happen again.As he prepares for heart surgery, Thomas Markle may be entitled to wonder whether those promises have been kept.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Moments later, Home Office official Hugh Ind told MPs the figure was ”up to five”.Mr Ind also admitted during his evidence that about £3.3m was paid out last year in compensation for detentions later ruled unlawful in the courts, and acknowledged that there was a “deep problem” with wrongful immigration detentions.When quizzed on whether Windrush citizens had been wrongly detained during the hearing on Tuesday, Mr Javid said he did not know, saying his priority was to know whether people had been wrongly been deported.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesA demonstrator holds a flare during a protest against Turkey\u0027s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan outside the entrance to Downing Street in central London.The funeral cortege of Alfie Evans goes past Everton\u0027s Goodison Park ground in Liverpool.

Another is those who were refused entry. And then there is the category of so-called ‘voluntary removals’, where people were bullied and brow-beaten into leaving under threat of deportation, even though they had a right to be here.”It comes after Labour accused the government of attempting to cover up any role that the prime minister might have had in the Windrush scandal earlier this month.Jeremy Corbyn’s spokesman said a government decision to oppose a plan for all papers relating to the debacle to be made public indicated the government was trying to “avoid accountability and clarity”.The Home Office\u0027s helpline has received at least 100 calls from the Caribbean nationals concerned that they’ve been wrongly told to leave.

Tory whips have told MPs to vote against the motion.\u0026nbspHere\u0027s the full motion:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the debate on Grenfell, Mr Brokenshire told MPs: While progress has been made, there is no question that this has been too slow. As a result, some households will still be in emergency accommodation in June.It was always going to be a challenge to respond to an unprecedented tragedy on this scale, it has taken time to purchase suitable homes, adapt and refurbish them to meet people\u0027s needs and the higher safety standards, but this is clearly not good enough.It is understandable the community will feel disappointed and let down. I too am very concerned, especially to see people who accepted an offer of a permanent home still living in emergency accommodation.I am therefore establishing at pace what further action can be done by the Government or by the council to speed up this process. The council now has over 300 properties available to those who need them, and my department will continue to work with the council to ensure people are given whatever support they need to be rehoused as swiftly as possible.Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, has told his Labour counterpart not to believe everything he reads in the papers following reports the government has shelved the new 26-30 railcard.\u0026nbspShadow transport secretary Andy McDonald raised the issue in the\u0026nbspCommons.He said: The i newspaper today reported that the millennial railcard, announced in the 2017 Budget, has been scrapped because the Treasury won\u0027t agree to fund it, which begs the question, why did the Chancellor announce it.This Government has nothing to offer this age group other than spin and broken promises.Mr Grayling said: He raised the issue of the railcard having been scrapped. I just advise him not to believe everything he reads in the papers.MPs have moved onto a debate on building regulations after Grenfell Tower.\u0026nbspShadow housing secretary John Healey says it is beyond me why it has taken 11 months for the PM to announce the funding for tower blocks but he welcomed the announcement nonetheless.The government has been rebuked by opposition MPs and the Speaker for scheduling the East Coast mainline announcement on the same day as a debate on Grenfell Tower.\u0026nbspJohn Bercow was stern with Mr Grayling over the move, as it will take time away from the debate later today - as there is only limited parliamentary time.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspReally helpful graphic from PA\u0027s data journalist Ian Jones, who has set out a history of the East Coast rail franchise.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLabour\u0027s Hilary Benn called on Mr Grayling to say he was re-nationalising the East Coast Main Line.Mr Benn said: This is third time that a private franchise on this line has failed.Now the Secretary of State just told the House that when it\u0027s fully formed the new LNER operation will be a partnership between the public and private sectors.Can he clarify, until that time, is it in effect going to be a publicly run service and if that is the case then he could have made a considerably shorter statement if he\u0027d just got up and said for the time being I am re-nationalising the East Coast Main Line.Mr Grayling replied: Well it\u0027ll be a publicly run service and we will be, over the next two to three years, developing the new model for the future which, as I say, will be a - the operator of last resort is a publicly run service, so yes it will be and we will be making the transitions to the new arrangements over that period.Labour Transport Committee chair,\u0026nbspLilian Greenwood,\u0026nbspsaid: The Secretary of State must take responsibility for this serious repeat failure.\u0026nbspIf Virgin-Stagecoach got their figures wrong then so did his department and he should apologise to passengers and taxpayers for that failure.Ms Greenwood also asked about the impact of the decision on other\u0026nbsprail\u0026nbspfranchises, which were struggling to meet their obligations.Chris Grayling insisted this\u0026nbsprailway had continued to deliver a higher level of contribution to the taxpayer than it did prior to 2014 and a higher level of customer satisfaction.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Mr Grayling had gifted the operators a \u0026pound2bn bailout after they failed on the main line, adding: And he has the audacity to come to that despatch box and say it\u0027s not reasonable to remove or place conditions on their passport. Absolutely ludicrous.The service\u0027s most successful period had come under public ownership, Mr McDonald said, until it was cynically reprivatised.He went on: The Government\u0027s incompetence has been disastrous for passengers and led to misery for millions.We\u0027ve been here before, many, many times. Year after year, the Secretary of State and his predecessors have stood at the despatch box and told the House that privatisation is being reformed.We\u0027ve had reform, reform and reform. We\u0027ve had bailout after bailout.\u0026nbspRail\u0026nbspcompanies win, passengers and taxpayers lose.There\u0027s a definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the same results. This is the situation we find ourselves in today.Franchising remains at the heart of the alleged partnership. No amount of tinkering can solve the failings of a broken privatised system, where the public takes the risk and the train companies take the profit, aided and abetted by the Transport Secretary.Speaking about the decision to renationalise Virgin Trains East Coast, the transport secretary Chris Grayling told the Commons:\u0026nbspI will terminate Virgin Trains East Coast\u0027s contract on June 24 2018.I plan to use a period of Operator of Last Resort control to shape the new partnership.So on the same day we will start with the launch of a new long-term brand for the East Coast Main Line through the recreation of one of Britain\u0027s iconic rail brands, the London and North Eastern Railway, the LNER.The team that\u0027s been working for me since last autumn to form the Operator of Last Resort will take immediate control of passenger services.They will then begin the task of working with Network Rail to bring together the teams operating the track and trains on the LNER network.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

How would I go about it?\u0027Anne Frank tried to cover up two pages of writing in her diary that contained dirty jokes and a description of what she referred to as “sexual matters,” pasting brown paper over the pages in her red-and-white plaid notebook.But researchers have revealed the hidden text using new digital technologies, the Anne Frank House and two other Dutch cultural institutions announced on Tuesday.Frank, the teenage diarist who wrote about coming of age in a secret attic annexe while in hiding from the Nazis during the Second World War, may have camouflaged the two pages because they contained prurient content that she did not want her father or someone else in the cramped quarters to discover.“I sometimes imagine that someone might come to me and ask me to inform him about sexual matters,” Frank wrote in Dutch. “How would I go about it?” She attempts an answer, addressing an imaginary listener with a lofty tone, using phrases such as “rhythmical movements” to describe sex, and “internal medicament,” to refer to contraception.Anne Frank inspires scheme to protect refugees from Israel deportationShe also touches on menstruation, “a sign that she is ripe”, and prostitution: “In Paris they have big houses for that.”Peter de Bruijn, a senior researcher at the Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands, one of the partners in the research, said the newly uncovered pages are not significant for their sexual content because Frank explores similar matters in other parts of the diary, often in even more explicit terms. He said these pages were important because they show Frank’s first foray into trying to write in a more literary tone.“She starts with an imaginary person whom she is telling about sex, so she creates a kind of literary environment to write about a subject she’s maybe not comfortable with,” he said.In an interview, Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House, said, “It is really interesting and adds meaning to our understanding of the diary.”“It’s a very cautious start to her becoming a writer,” he said. “It’s still very early stages.”The two newly revealed pages were written in Frank’s first diary on September 28, 1942, when she was 13 years old. During her time in hiding, she wrote two versions of the diary. The first was written in a series of small notebooks, from her 13th birthday on June 12, 1942, until August 1, 1944, and was intended strictly for herself.But one day she heard on the radio that the Dutch government in exile was planning to publish eyewitness accounts of people’s suffering under the German occupation, and she resolved to write a new book she called “The Secret Annexe,” based on her diaries, which she hoped to submit after the war. She completed 215 loose pages in a couple of months, but in August 1944, she and her family were discovered, arrested and deported. She died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp three months before her 16th birthday, in 1945.Lazio to wear Anne Frank on their shirts in bid to fight anti-SemitismAnne Frank Centre calls on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u0027s accountRemembered: Judith Jones, editor who rescued Anne Frank’s diaryDe Bruijn said Frank may have also pasted over the pages as a form of self-editing as she revised her diary in preparation for the second, public version.Researchers at the Anne Frank House discovered the two hidden pages in the original version of the diary while they were checking its condition and photographing the pages in 2016. The notebooks are in storage for safe keeping and only examined once every 10 years.Until now, the technology that would have allowed researchers to look at the covered pages without destroying them wasn’t available. “When you touch the pages they can be damaged, so we don’t touch them,” said Teresien da Silva, head of collections at the Anne Frank House. Using photo-imaging software, they were able to decipher text beneath the brown paper without any contact with the pages.Could it be considered disrespectful to reveal pages that Frank wanted to hide?“You can compare it, for example, with finding out that there’s something painted underneath a Rembrandt masterpiece,” da Silva said. “When you discover that you want to know what’s underneath, because it can tell you about how he worked.”She also compared it to salvaging the writings of Franz Kafka, who wanted to destroy many of his own literary works. “It’s not always good to follow the wish of an author,” she said. “It’s important sometimes for scientific research and also good to know for the public what she didn’t want to publish.”A spokeswoman for the Anne Frank House said the museum would make the new text available on its website, but only in Dutch at the moment, because of copyright restrictions. She said she did not know when the text would be available in English.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel.

The former Suits actress could be forgiven for feeling she is losing control of her special day.But then if marrying into the Royal Family means also wedding yourself to centuries of tradition perhaps the nervous bride can take some comfort from the fact that even if dad is not there on Saturday royal weddings have a long history of mishaps.Distressing though the absence of her father might be for Meghan, back in 1328 Princess Philippa of Hainault had to contend not with a missing parent but a missing roof.Her wedding to Edward III was conducted in York Minster, which was still under construction and the happy couple were forced to say their vows in the middle of a snow storm.THROW IN THE TOWEL? Diana was talked into not pulling outMore recently the union of Prince Harry\u0027s mother and father in 1981 is still held up as the ultimate in royal pomp but the truth is it nearly didn\u0027t happen.Days before the ceremony Lady Diana, then just 20 years old, tried to call the whole thing off after discovering that her 32-year-old fianc\u0026eacute had not ended his affair with mistress Camilla Parker Bowles.She was convinced to change her mind by older sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale (coincidentally an old flame of Charles) who told Diana she had to go through with it because the tea towels are printed.Diana later fluffed her lines at the altar, pledging herself to Philip Charles Arthur George instead of Charles Philip Arthur George, prompting Prince Andrew to quip: You\u0027ve married his father.Royal weddings: The bride and groom with their bridal parties.

Seven monarchs before Elizabeth and Prince Philip\u0027s wedding, the union of the future George IV and his cousin Princess Caroline of Brunswick in 1795 seemed to be doomed from the start.A dissolute, overweight drunkard, his happy day - and choice of bride - had been arranged by his father who demanded George wed her in return for paying off his debts.The couple married after having met just once. Upon laying eyes on his fianc\u0026eacutee for the first time George declared: I\u0027m not well! Get me a glass of brandy! It then emerged that he was already secretly married to one of his mistresses: Catholic widow Maria Fitzherbert.That wedding was quickly declared invalid according to the new Royal Marriages Act.After the service George is said to have spent the majority of the evening passed out in a drunken stupor on his bedroom floor.And even if things don\u0027t go according to plan on Saturday afternoon Meghan can be reassured that whatever happens her big day will be better than that of Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha who in 1736 married George IV\u0027s grandfather Frederick, Prince of Wales.Their wedding ceremony was a shambles.First Princess Augusta publicly begged her mother not to leave her at the altar and then, unable to speak a word of English, she had to have her vows shouted into her ear by Frederick so she could repeat them phonetically.As if all that was not spectacle enough she rounded off proceedings in technicolour style by vomiting all over her gown and her mother-in-law Queen Caroline.Now that really would be a day to remember."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/590x/Princess-Charlotte-bridesmaid-royal-wedding-960479.jpg","title":"princess charlotte bridesmaid meghan markle prince harry royal wedding latest news","story":"Prince Harry\u0026rsquos niece Princess Charlotte and nephew Prince George will reprise their roles as bridesmaid and pageboy for the royal wedding, Kensington Palace announced today.The four-year-old prince and three-year-old princess charmed royal fans at the wedding of their auntie Pippa Middleton last year.Florence van Cutsem, aged three, who is the goddaughter of Prince Harry and daughter of Alice van Cutsem and Major Nicholas van Cutsem has also been named among the list of bridesmaids.Meghan Markle\u0027s goddaughters Remi Litt, aged six, and Rylan Litt, aged seven, will be bridesmaids as will Ivy Mulroney, aged four, the daughter of Meghan\u0026rsquos close friends Jessica Mulroney and Benedict Mulroney and Zalie Warren, aged two, the goddaughter of Prince Harry.Prince George will be joined by\u0026nbspJasper Dyer, aged six, who is the godson of Prince Harry,\u0026nbspBrian Mulroney, aged seven, and\u0026nbspJohn Mulroney, aged seven \u0026ndash the twin sons of Meghan\u0027s friends\u0026nbspJessica and Benedict\u0026nbspMulroney.A Kensington Palace statement added: \u0026ldquoDetails about the bridesmaids\u0026rsquo dresses and the page boys\u0026rsquo uniforms will be made available on the wedding day.Princess Charlotte will one of Meghan Markle\u0026rsquos bridesmaids for the royal wedding on Saturday                Meghan Markle\u0026rsquos royal wedding dash mapped: Route bride will take                Meghan Markle\u0027s mum Doria leaves for London with BRITISH designer bagMeghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026rsquos royal wedding bridesmaids:Princess Charlotte, aged 3Florence van Cutsem, aged 3Remi Litt, aged 6Rylan Litt, aged 4Ivy Mulroney, aged 4Zalie Warren, aged 2INSTAGRAMJessica MulroneyJessica Mulroney\u0026rsquos children Ivy, Brian and John will be in Meghan and Harry\u0027s weddingMeghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026rsquos royal wedding page boys:Prince George, aged 4Jasper Dyper, aged 7Brian Mulroney, aged 7John Mulroney, aged 7INSTAGRAMMeghan Markle\u0027s goddaughters Remi and Rylan Litt will be among her young bridesmaidsThe last time Charlotte and George were a bridesmaid and pageboy, the Queen\u0026rsquos adorable great-grandchildren momentarily stole the limelight from Pippa and her now-husband James Matthews.Charlotte looked the part for Kate sister\u0026rsquos wedding, where the young princess looked adorable in a pretty white dress with a pink bow with her hair adorned with a flower crown.While Prince George played pageboy in a crisp white shirt with a cute Peter Pan collar, teamed with pale olive silk knickerbockers and tights.It has been a busy year for the youngsters, who welcomed their new baby brother into the world on St George\u0026rsquos Day.At just under a month old, Prince Louis will not be at the royal wedding and it is expected he remain at the family\u0027s home in Kensington Palace while his parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attend the royal wedding.Meghan Markle\u0026rsquos bridesmaids to include Princess Charlotte while Prince George will be a pageboy for the royal wedding.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist. Only men can be sexist.All white men are “privileged” — another invented offence — ­simply because they are white and male.This group is decreed by the Left to embrace all Tories who, by definition, are “scum”. Only Tories can be cruel.Schools might churn out 16-year-olds who can’t read or write but that is apparently because Tories support ­grammar schools, not because left-wing teaching unions ­outlawed classroom ­discipline.A tower-block inferno could have erupted in Labour- controlled Islington but fate picked Kensington and “evil” Tories are now forever ­identified with the incineration of poor immigrants.The NHS is in crisis — and has been under every ­government for the past 30 years.But despite pouring ­billions into healthcare, Tory “scum” are to blame.Labour delivered mass ­immigration but it is the “vile” Tories who failed to see we would need extra houses, schools and hospitals.Welfare was out of control but it was “callous” Tories who swapped jobs for benefits.Now, preposterously, the United Nations apparently agrees.After a brief flying visit — and without a shred of ­evidence — the UN’s racism busybody, Zambian Tendayi Achiume, says we are a racist nation in breach of international human rights laws, thanks to Brexit and austerity.Has she been to Europe recently, where attitudes to immigration suggest Britain is in fact a haven of tolerance and integration?Luckily, ­people are not ­stupid. They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account. Our country is all the better for it.No one who values liberty would have it any other way.BRITISH politics has lost one of its good guys.The outpouring of tributes for Tessa Jowell highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.

Leaving ANY part of the EU is “Hard Brexit” now. It is laughable.Who do they imagine would tell 17.4million people their votes were to be ignored?Not Miliband, hiding in Manhattan.These Remain ultras are blind to the obvious: that the story has moved on.And that — while the nation is divided and Brexit negotiations are struggling — THEY are largely to blame, for laying siege to the referendum result itself.Their every word stokes division, helps Brussels and harms Britain.MPs must kill the second Leveson Inquiry.There is simply no case in this new, transformed media landscape — far more tightly regulated, yet dominated by UNREGULATED tech giants — for yet another public examination into alleged wrongdoing long ago. That view unites The Sun and the .It was dismal  seeing one ill-informed peer after another misjudge an issue they clearly had no desire to grasp, then outrageously voting to defy the elected chamber’s decision of just days ago.For Labour, Leveson 2 would settle a score against critical newspapers like The Sun.

And we urge the DUP not to saddle the Government with a new ­burden to which it is staunchly opposed.There are many better ways of spending public money and voters know it.THE head of MI5 is admirably blunt about Russia’s criminality and lies. It is to the Left’s shame that they act as its stooges.Andrew Parker is immersed in the facts about the Salisbury poisoning and other outrages. The Kremlin, he says, is guilty of “criminal thuggery” and covers its tracks with “bare-faced” lies.This should be indisputable. But Labour is now run by the gangster state’s apologists.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You will see thousands of police as you approach the stadium.“You will be walking down avenues of police with shields, helmets and guns.”Chief Inspector Joseph Stokoe, of the Met Police and head hooligan spotter in Russia, added : “People need to be aware that the numbers of police and military that you will see at games will frankly be off the scale as to what you see in the UK.”British police say the chances of violence at matches will be “remote.”Football policing boss Mr Roberts said : “Russia is committed to providing a safe haven and a festival of football.“Notwithstanding everything else that is going on, we do have a shared interest in this,” he said in reference to the Salisbury poisoning of Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, and Boris Johnson’s comparison of Vladimir Putin to Hitler.At a briefing held at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in Westminster yesterday, Mr Roberts outlined the punishment awaiting hooligans falling foul of local Russian cops.At the minor end of the scale, touts face a £20,000 fine and deportation for every ticket they are caught selling while petty offences are punishable with 15 days imprisonment and a £291 fine.Individual hooligans causing trouble face five years hard labour in a detention centre, 480 hours of community service and a £5,825 fine.Anyone caught and convicted of mass disorder will be sentenced to between eight and 15 years hard labour and 10 years in a modern day gulag for assaulting anyone in authority, such as a cop or soldier.Up to 10,000 England fans are expected to travel to Russia, despite the paltry allocation of official tickets, through the FA.Just 1,460 tickets have been allocated to England for the Tunisia match, 1,772 for the second group game against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod on June 24 and 2,359 for the final encounter four days later against Belgium in Kalinigrad, on the Polish border.Mr Roberts warned that any fans travelling without a ticket for the World Cup would be unlikely to be granted a visa to enter Russia.He also pointed out the logistical problems caused by the “huge distances” between cities and shortage of available accommodation.A total of 1,751 football banning orders have been issued by courts against yobs who must surrender their passports in advance of the tournament.Spotters from the UK Football Policing Unit are being deployed at UK ports to watch for hardcore thugs trying to sneak out of the country and will also be on the ground in Russia to engage with fans.Police chief Mr Roberts said the main concern were middle-of-the road fans who end up drinking too much and causing trouble rather than known hooligans.He said : “They are the people who there with a stag party excess...this gives me a degree of concern.”Warning of the particular concern about offence being caused in Volgograd and at its commemorative sites, he added : “Any student of history will know Russian casualties during World War Two were horrific.“If people from any other country got drunk and placed their flag on the Cenotaph it would make the locals here angry.”Kevin Miles, chief executive of the England Supporters’ Federation, has visited the cities where the Three Lions are playing, and said : “We have to treat the place with respect.“It is one thing to hang a flag up in a bar where the landlord has been taking your money.“But it is quite another to put in a place of particular sensitivity.“We want to be treated as welcome guests.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She’s been devastated by what’s happened.“After the revelation he had staged those paparazzi pictures, she has felt so let down and majorly questioned his loyalties.“He collaborated with the Press yet never condemned the actions of his other children Samantha and Junior, who were forever publicly disparaging Meghan.”While history has taught us is that the royals are adept at looking after themselves, this latest episode has left many wondering: just who is looking out for Thomas Markle?Clearly, the retired Hollywood lighting director has been left to fend for himself.Palace sources indicate that he was offered significant help and advice — but he turned it down.They also suggested that Meghan, 36, and Harry, 33, had tried to contact him before she finally got through yesterday.Thomas said he had not heard from his younger daughter after it made global news that he was not going to the wedding.But he said he had changed his mind after Meghan had called him.As for the advice — maybe it was never offered or perhaps he refused it as a proud man who believed he could handle the pressure.Either way, the Palace suits should have stayed in close contact because they must know the pressure is worse than he expected.Now he’s so anxious he’s been “popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter”.That is Samantha Markle — Meghan’s estranged half-sister who hasn’t seen her for ten years and is not invited.She has been shading Meghan as a “pushy princess” at every opportunity.And why no intervention from the Palace?Why has no one flown over to collect him, protect him behind castle gates and show some ­concern for a vulnerable man with heart problems?Where did it all go wrong and who to believe in this sorry saga?Thomas Markle Snr was a successful lighting director, but obviously bad with money.After his retirement he declared himself bankrupt in 2016 with credit card debts of £24,181 and savings of just £160.He moved to tiny Rosarito just across the US border with Mexico, hiding from the world in a ­ramshackle cliff-top house and not socialising with any of the expats.Thomas was so upset after he was pictured earlier this year looking dishevelled, he wanted to control the narrative.He colluded with a photo agency to get shots of him being measured for a suit, working out, reading a book on English history and looking at internet ­pictures of Harry and Meghan.Then came the bombshell revelation that he was so embarrassed to have been rumbled taking cash for the snaps, that he was pulling out of the wedding.Princess Diana’s best friend Rosa Monckton helped her pal dodge the paparazzi — but also knew how she used them for her own ends.Rosa told The Sun: “He strikes me as a man who is out of his depth at every level on this and I don’t judge him at all.“They should have advised him to hide up somewhere until after the wedding. He’s obviously very vulnerable and I don’t know what could have been done or should have been done to offer him more advice and protection.”So should that advice have come from Meghan — the actress with a grasp of the pitfalls of global fameTo answer that you need to understand their up-and-down relationship. Thomas was overjoyed at the birth of his baby girl with second wife Doria Ragland and appears to have been a positive role model for Suits star Meghan.Meghan has credited her dad — who won two Emmys — with being a huge influence on her career.Describing him as “hardworking” and “caring”, she has said that he “invested in my future so that I could grow up to have so much”.For a man from a poor family who grew up on simple dinners of “potatoes and spam”, this was helped by a £500,000 lottery win when Meghan was nine. Her half-brother Tom Jnr said: “That money allowed Meg to go to the best schools and get the best training”.Thomas Snr overcame the racial prejudice of others to marry an African-American and helped develop his daughter’s social conscience.He and Doria got hitched in 1979 but separated when Meghan was six.However, Thomas stayed in close contact with his daughter.Meghan recalled him buying a white Barbie family set and a black Barbie family — splitting them up to make “her” family. But as a teenager she didn’t want to see her father.Driving through her home city of Los Angeles aged 18 with then-best friend Ninaki Priddy, she said she would not visit her dad as they “weren’t on the best of terms”.But a post Meghan sent to her dad on Instagram on Father’s Day 2016 showed the extent of his influence on her and her love for him.She declared: “To this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films and club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank-you notes, and for giving me that signature Markle nose. I love you xo — Bean.” It was accompanied by a photo showing Meghan as an infant laying on her father’s chest.But a friend said of Thomas: “He’s always been a bit of a slob, selfish with no emotional intelligence.“They didn’t really connect when she was growing up as a girl and didn’t bond when she was a woman.“There were periods when they were closer — he helped her move to Toronto when she started Suits (in 2012). But as he’s become older he’s become much more reclusive.“The man he is today is not the man he was even ten, 15 years ago. He just eats junk food, sleeps in, drinks and reads.“She has helped him many times financially. But there just comes a point when you have to let go.“Not exactly wash her hands of him but there is only so much she can do.“Hence why she didn’t feel Harry had to meet him or that she needed her dad’s approval to get married.”Thomas is now saying he will make the wedding — as long as doctors allow him to fly. Let’s hope for Meghan’s sake he does.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

they could no longer afford to run one of britains busiest railway lines","story":"Chris Grayling, the Transport Secretary, revealed the Government will take back control of services after Stagecoach and Virgin said they had bid too much for them.This has prompted fears the move could cost the taxpayers millions of pounds, something the Department for Transport have denied.But the decision to bring the line back into public hands is a major embarrassment for the Government, which has repeatedly defended the private franchise model for the railways.And it is unlikely to have a positive benefit for passengers, with no signals that tickets prices would come down with the trains under Government control.Since 2015 Stagecoach and Virgin have run the franchise on a 90-10 split under the Virgin Trains East Coast brand, originally signing on to run it until 2023.The line is to be renationalised after private firms said they could no longer afford to run itBut last year the firms admitted they had overestimated passenger numbers and suffered a revenue shortfall, and would be handing it back to the Government three years early.Mr Grayling had hinted that the franchise was not going well, revealing in February that Stagecoach had incurred losses of almost £200million.He could have decided to renegotiate not-for-profit deal with the two operators to keep it going, but ministers have ditched that option and opted instead to take “direct” control of the line.It is the third time a private operator has failed to complete the full length of a contract to run services on the East Coast route.GNER was stripped of the route in 2007 after its parent company suffered financial difficulties, while National Express withdrew in 2009, which led to the Government taking control of the services.It was meant to only last for 18 months, but it remained in public hands for six years until Virgin Trains East Coast took over the line in 2015.It will take over the franchise on June 24, and until then there will be no change to the service offered to rail users.The Government say tickets, timetables and train services will all stay the same once the switchover happens, with no expected disruption.And tickets bought through Virgin Trains East Coast’s booking system will still be valid on LNER services after June 24, and travel vouchers from previous refunds are also validThe Department for Transport also said there will be “no immediate changes to ticket prices”, and any future changes “will be in line with normal market practice”.It also confirmed passengers can still claim compensation for delays of more than 30 minutes, and the catering and bike storage services will remain the same.The decision to end the £3.3billion contract this year has been described as a bailout by Labour and trade unions, something Mr Grayling denied.And Stagecoach Group said it was surprised and disappointed the Government chose not to award it a new deal to continue running services on the London to Edinburgh route.They pledged to work “constructively” with the Department for Transport and the new operator in the weeks ahead “to ensure a professional transfer to the new arrangements.Stagecoach chief executive Martin Griffiths, said he respected the Governments decision, but added: We believe our plans offered a positive, value-for-money way forward for passengers, taxpayers and local communities, ensuring the continuation of the exciting transformation already under way on East Coast and a smooth transition to the Governments new East Coast Partnership.The renationalisation of the line is expected to last for the next two years, before a new “public-private partnership model” will be introduced.Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said Mr Grayling had gifted the operators a £2billion bailout after they failed on the main line.He went on: The Governments incompetence has been disastrous for passengers and led to misery for millions.And the Labour chair of the Transport Committee Lilian Greenwood called on Mr Grayling to apologise, saying: The Secretary of State must take responsibility for this serious repeat failure.“If Virgin-Stagecoach got their figures wrong then so did his department and he should apologise to passengers and taxpayers for that failure.Anthony Smith, chief executive of independent watchdog Transport Focus, said: Whichever organisation runs East Coast services, under whatever new arrangements, passengers will be looking for the quality of current services to be maintained and built on.”Pointing out that East Coast is currently the top-rated franchised train service in Great Britain, he said “reliability must continue to improve, and promised and new investments made.And Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash said: This is the second time that the Government have called upon the public sector to launch a rescue operation on the East Coast Main Line and instead of being a temporary arrangement Chris Grayling should listen to his staff and the public and make it permanent.”He added: Anything else risks playing out the same expensive farce over and over again.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was scary.“But I tried not to show this, we were hiding in the house.”Officials say all her documents were lost during the Second Chechen War from 1999 to 2009.The pension fund, a state body, claims there are 37 people over 110 years of age in Russia.But all these claims, including Koku’s, are impossible to verify because of the lack of reliable birth or early childhood written records.Since the death of 117-year-old Nabi Tajima in Japan last month, the oldest documented woman in the world is regarded as Chiyo Miyako, born on 2 May 1901, also from Japan.The oldest documented human lifespan is Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived 122 years, 164 days, dying in 1997."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may jeremy corbyn brexit pmqs","story":"The PM blasted the Labour boss in the Commons after a string of shadow ministers expressed support for a re-run of the EU vote.And she warned that Mr Corbyn would “sell Britain out” in negotiations with Brussels if he ever got into power.The pair clashed in fiery exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions - as the Labour leader accused the PM of being unable to unite her warring ministers.Mr Corbyn said: “When the Prime Minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next Cabinet meeting?”But Mrs May pointed out that shadow ministers Lord Hunt and Preet Gill both recently expressed support for a second referendum which could overturn the will of the people on Brexit.The PM said to Mr Corbyn: “This month the Shadow Health Minister in the Lords voted for a second referendum, at the weekend the Shadow Brexit Secretary refused to rule out a second referendum, and on Monday the Shadow International Development Minister tweeted in favour of a second referendum.“So perhaps when he stands up he could put the minds of the British people and this house at rest and rule out a second referendum.”The Labour boss responded by mocking Cabinet divisions over post-Brexit customs, saying: “If the Prime Minister cannot even convince her own Cabinet of a strategy, what chance does she have of convincing 27 other EU governments?”Mrs May reminded MPs that Mr Corbyn wanted to trigger Article 50 the day after the EU referendum - which would have left just two years to complete the whole Brexit process.She added: “What would that have led to? What Labour do every time they’re in government - they’d have sold Britain out.”The PM insisted voters “simply cannot trust” anything Labour say.And she also sent out a message to all MPs who are trying to backslide on the referendum result - saying: I consider it to be a matter of integrity of politicians that having given the choice to the British people, we should then deliver for them on that choice.Mrs May is currently trying to thrash out an agreement on what customs arrangement to push for once we have quit the EU.But Labour is also divided - with backbenchers pushing Mr Corbyn to support plans to keep Britain tied to the European single market.During todays PMQs, Mrs May also announced that the Government will pick up the full £400million bill for removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks in the wake of the Grenfell disaster."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406156407.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle nephew tyler dad thomas royal wedding","story":"Tyler, grandson of Thomas Markle Sr, revealed how the family was still hopeful that the stars dad would be at the Royal Wedding this Saturday.Tyler Dooley and his family flew into the UK this week, drafted in as special correspondents for Good Morning Britain for the big day - despite barely speaking to the bride-to-be in years.Speaking to the Sun, Meghans nephew Tyler, dressed in a blue suit and large sunglasses, said he was excited for the wedding.What we know so far...When asked if Meghans dad would be attending, Tyler replied: We all hope so.

They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.”Anne, age 13 at the time, wrote the two pages on September 28, 1942, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex behind a canal-side house in Amsterdam.Later on, possibly fearing prying eyes or no longer liking what she had written, she covered them over with brown paper, their content remaining a mystery for decades.But its now emerged the pages contained four jokes about sex that Anne herself described as “dirty” and an explanation of women’s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.“They bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank,” Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House museum said.Experts on Anne’s diary said the newly discovered text, when studied together with the rest of her diary, reveals more about Anne’s development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.Leopold said the words are similar to other passages dealing with sex that already have been published in the multimillion-selling diary.However, he said it provides an early example of how Anne “creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about.”In her diary, for example, she addressed entries to a fictional friend named Kitty.Anne wrote her diary while she and her family hid for more than two years during World War II.The family went into hiding in July 1942 and remained there, provided with food and other essentials by a close-knit group of helpers, until August 4 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.Only Anne’s father Otto Frank survived the war while Anne, at the age of 15, and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp.After the war, Otto Frank had his daughter’s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages, and the house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam’s most popular tourist attractions."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406626218.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside europes desolate and forgotten churches that have been left to crumble as christianity declines across the continent","story":"Eerie photographs from these abandoned sites show cracked murals and ceilings, walls covered in cobwebs, caved-in roofs and floors filled with rubble.Urban explorer Alessandro Romanelli, 45, captured the pictures while on a tour of Italy, France, Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic.I faced many problems during my explorations, from falling to facing the police, security guards and dogs, he said.These buildings are closed to the public for being unsafe and to prevent vandalism or other types of intrusion.What you see in these pictures is the absence of man.

The telecoms giant is opening BT zones in its more than 650 EE stores - 16 years after closing the last of its phone shops. Customers will be able to get advice on BT products and do things like query bills. BT also vowed to bring back all call centre work to the UK and Ireland by 2020. Currently 20% of customer calls to BT are answered abroad. The move is billed as one of BT’s biggest attempts yet to overhaul its customer service. Figures from industry watchdog Ofcom in April showed BT and budget offshoot Plusnet were the second and third most complained about broadband firms - behind TalkTalk - although its EE arm had the second lowest.  BT was also the most complained about pay TV and mobile provider, and was above average for the number of landline gripes. Other initiates announced include new combined broadband and mobile package allowing customers to switch between the two depending on reception. It has also pledged to provide ultrafast broadband speeds to more homes, be first to launch 5G mobile services, and add Amazon Prime Video to its BT TV set-top box. Marc Allera, boss of BT’s consumer arm, said: “Our customers demand better connections and the best service no matter where they are.” The investment comes a week after BT announced plans to axe 13,000 workers in other parts of its business.  It is taking on hundreds of staff in its consumer arm. The first BT shop opened in 1985 in Southend, Essex, and grew into a nationwide chain.

David Davis has told the Prime Minister that her favoured plan for a customs partnership with the EU could violate international trade law. Lorand Bartels, senior counsel at Linklaters who teaches WTO law at Cambridge University, said: “The customs union partnership model raises a question of WTO legality. It requires businesses to track imported products but not competitive domestic products. That violates one of the WTO’s non-discrimination obligations.”  It comes as Labour is set to stage a Commons ambush in a bid to force the Government to publish secret papers on its plans for a customs deal with Brussels after Brexit .    In the Commons, Labour will use ancient parliamentary rules to force a binding vote which could see ministers having to hand over all the papers presented to the Brexit war Cabinet on the economic effects of both options.  Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said: “The Government’s Brexit strategy is in complete and utter deadlock. Nearly two years on from the referendum ministers have still yet to agree what our future customs and trading relationship with Europe will look like after Brexit. Instead, the Prime Minister has wasted months pursing her two fatally flawed customs options and presiding over a government that is too busy arguing with itself to negotiate for Britain.” But the de facto deputy Prime Minister insisted that the UK will not be asking for an extension to the almost two-year transition period with the European Union.   Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said the Government wanted to demonstrate that we have thought this through with its Brexit white paper.   He said two ministerial working groups set up by Theresa May last week to look for improvements to customs proposals could take weeks. The PM has asked smaller groups of ministers to go away and test out over the next days and weeks those detailed questions, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. So, for example, on the new customs partnership the questions are around to what extent does this inhibit an independent trade policy for the future and can we mitigate those impacts? Mr Lidington confirmed that assessments are being made on the legal risks of the customs options being considered.

Referring to the recruitment of more officials to handle  He asked the prime minister to give details of the number of HMRC officials they are recruiting but she refused to answer.   The Labour leader said the numbers reportedly being recruited would not even cover those lost since 2010 because of Tory cuts.  Mr Corbyn said: It seems that the Dutch government is more prepared for Brexit than the British government.  But Theresa May tried to shift the focus onto divisions within the Labour Party including the shadow health minister in the Lords voting for a second referendum.  More than 80 Labour Lords also defied the whip to support keeping the UK in the single market.  The Prime Minister said: This government has a policy of leaving the customs union and of ensuring that as we do so we have as frictionless trade as possible with the EU.   But if he\u0027s talking about friction, perhaps he could reflect on the fact that this month the shadow health minister in the Lords voted for a second referendum.

Prize-winning patisserie chef Alessandra Botham, 25, said she started baking as she put herself on a strict diet and exercise routine. She didn\u0027t realise she had anorexia as her weight plummeted to six stone and her BMI sank to around 16.2 - which is considered in the \u0027danger zone\u0027. The chef now gets support from a clinic and dietician and believes her passion for cooking sweet treats has helped her manage her disorder - yet she still doesn’t eat her own goodies.  Alessandra, from Stockton, County Durham, said: “I call myself a walking paradox because I started out baking properly when I started starving myself. “The recipes are based on things I think would be nice to eat, but I don’t eat anything I make. “Baking was a childhood passion that grew and developed - I love feeding others and have a massive family so as every birthday passed I would bake a big cake and became more advanced every time.  “I wasn’t aware I had anorexia - I just knew I didn’t like my weight and I liked the habit of restricting what I ate. “It was all about getting control. I didn’t think I could be anorexic because I did eat and I was living with it.” After leaving university, Alessandra attended a patisserie course one evening a week where she quickly realised she had a rare talent.  She said: The irony was that I was a student baker and I loved baking, but I was restricting what I ate. But going to that course proved how good I was at baking - I already knew how to do everything. “I think the head chef agreed, even though I was one of the youngest, and encouraged me to volunteer somewhere that does afternoon tea so I could get apply my skills in the real world. After six months volunteering at an award-winning luxury hotel in County Durham, Alessandra was offered a job as a junior chef, where she would bake up to 600 macarons a day.  However the long 14-hour shifts proved a struggle with her rigid routine for eating and exercising and she quickly became depressed. Alessandra said: “I knew I had to eat at certain times otherwise I would get more ill. At 12 o’clock each day I would excuse myself to go to the toilet and instead I would quickly eat something in the toilet. “I lost weight. I like losing weight, don’t get me wrong, but I have to be in charge of it. “I loved volunteering there because it was really posh and I learned a lot, and my whole team were really good fun.  “But when I was working, my hours were a lot less flexible and I knew I was becoming ill. I only survived two months before I quit.” She found a happier career as a sales assistant, but her low weight meant she was constantly cold, tired and in pain, and hadn’t had a period since she was 20 years old. Her need to exercise saw her jogging on the spot for hours at a time to try and hit over 34,000 steps a day. Alessandra sought help from her doctors but it took years before she was finally diagnosed with anorexia.  She said: “Honestly, it was a huge shock. I was absolutely terrified. “I knew how I ate was a bit quirky but I never expected to hear a diagnosis like that. I just thought it was me being me.” She was referred to a specialist eating disorder clinic who have helped her find small ways to increase what she eats, such as including a sandwich and soya milk into her daily routine. Because her anorexia and compulsion to exercise was a form of OCD, she also decided to speak to a psychologist about her need to exercise. With just over a month left at the clinic, Alessandra is nervous about facing her future without their support.  Alessandra, who now has a much healthier BMI of 19.5, said: “The recovery is the worst thing I have ever endured - it’s a proper, proper challenge. I don’t think I have ever been in as much pain. “No one likes to gain weight. Having to gain weight is always hard. “Even though I know it is to get healthier, my mind is still screaming at me and as my appearance changes I worry about things I know are silly, like that my boyfriend won’t find me attractive anymore. “I don’t think we can put a date on recovery. It’s like a break up. They say to get over someone we need to be without them for two thirds the length of the relationship. “If that’s the same with anorexia, I have another five years and that is a little overwhelming.

Now Earl Spencer he married model Victoria Lockwood on September 16, 1989, at the Church of St Mary, Great Brington, Northants. 2. The Queen  Then eight-year-old Princess Elizabeth, our future Queen wore a fairy-like dress for her uncle Prince George, Duke of Kent. He was 31 when he tied the knot with second cousin Princess Marina of Greece and Denmark at Westminster Abbey on November 29, 1934 . 3 Prince Andrew  His outfit may have made him look like a little Austin Powers, but a six-year-old Prince Andrew was still adorable when the Marquis of Hamilton married Sacha Phillips at Westminster Abbey on October 20, 1966. 4 Princess Margaret  Aged 17, she was a bridesmaid at the wedding of sister Princess Elizabeth to the Duke of Edinburgh on November 20, 1947. Princess Margaret repeated the role on July 31, 1950, at the wedding of her cousin Margaret Elphinstone to the writer Denys Gravenor Rhodes. 5 Prince Edward  When 23-year-old Princess Anne wed first husband Mark Phillips, a lieutenant in the 1st Queen’s Dragoon Guards, she \u0026shyenlisted her brother for the big day on November 14, 1973.

KMTV local news anchor Cameron Tucker was giving a live report about a couple that were caught growing almost 100 plants inside a stunning thatched cottage. Yvette and Neil Hartley narrowly avoided prison despite cops finding 88 cannabis plants at their \u0026pound500,000 thatched cottage, in rural Hoath, Kent. The pair were handed a suspended sentence on Monday, but the local TV channel went to their cottage for the evening news on Tuesday.  Wearing a black shirt and tan shorts, the man walked beside the cottage carrying a black pot and a tall, leafy plant. There is no reason to believe the plant was illegal. When he realised he was on camera, the lad took off at a sprint and ran out of shot - just as the local reporter turned around. During the amusing live feed, Cameron said: Well last August when it was found that Neil and Yvette Hartley had been growing about 90 cannabis plants. Little did their neighbours know that in this quiet pretty little corner of the Kent countryside, the cottage just over my shoulder has been where they had been growing cannabis.  Kent Police knows of the footage but is not aware of any crimes being committed. Charity worker Yvette and loss adjuster Neil admitted producing the class B drug, but claimed it was for their own use. Mrs Hartley first claimed their plant stash would be used to make cannabis oil to treat cancer. Neil, 45, and Yvette, 48, both pleaded guilty to producing the class B drug, but a sympathetic judge spared the pair jail, at Canterbury Crown Court on Monday.  Recorder Jonathan Davies took pity on the couple, who ran a \u0027well established cannabis factory\u0027 as part of \u0027a much larger operation\u0027. You risked their futures by your conduct because you must have known the consequences of what you were doing, he said. I am not sure if either of you has ever told the truth about this operation, which would have involved daily attention and was done for financial reasons. I suspect the cannabis oil was just a smokescreen to cover up the nature of it.

Dubbed the \u0027wedding of the year,\u0027 there is a lot to think about and the day has been planned minute by minute.  Today the couple announced Princess Charlotte and Prince George would be part of their team of bridesmaids and page boys .   It has also emerged that Meghan\u0027s dad, Thomas Markle Snr, will not be attending the wedding nor walking his daughter down the aisle because he needs to undergo major heart surgery.  The rest of the day has been planned carefully though, with fans getting excited to see the day unfold. But what time will Meghan appear? When does the service begin? And when can you catch a glimpse of the procession?   Here is the schedule for the royal wedding :   9am: Members of the public watching the wedding from the Windsor Castle grounds will arrive.   9.30-11am: Chapel guests will start to arrive and enter through the South Door.   11.20am: The Royal Family begin to arrive and enter via the Galilee Porch, some on foot others by car.   11.45am: Harry and William arrive at the Chapel\u0027s West Steps, walking past golden ticket holders in the castle grounds.   11.55-11.59am: Following protocol, The Queen is the last of the royals to arrive.    11.59am: Meghan arrives at the Chapel\u0027s West Steps by car.   She will start her journey with mum Doria Ragland - but when the car stops at the castle her mum will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys.  Her dad Thomas Markle was supposed to then walk her down the aisle, but now it remains unconfirmed who will. Meghan\u0027s dad is reportedly being prepped for major heart surgery and it is incredibly unlikely he will make it to Windsor Castle. Her mum Doria may be the one to take over, but it is yet to be announced.   Noon: Service starts.   1pm: Service ends and the newlyweds emerge at the West Steps.   1.05pm: Carriage procession through Windsor begins taking 25 minutes before they return to castle for afternoon reception.   The royal procession will start off at Windsor Castle, setting off at Snow Hill in Windsor Great Park.  It will then make its way through the high street and Windsor Town centre through Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk, returning to Windsor Castle.  It\u0027s expected to take around 25-30 minutes thousands of people are expected to descend on Windsor so it allows for plenty of time for everyone along the route to see the couple and celebrate with them. A statement on Kensington Palace\u0027s Twitter page read: They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day. There will be designated spectator areas along the procession route so you’ll want to head down early if you’re hoping to get a good vantage point.

The airline has slashed the time passengers are able to check-in from four days before departure to just 48 hours. This means that those who don\u0027t reserve a seat have two days to check in before their flight - and if they don\u0027t do so within two hours they could be hit with a \u0026pound55 fee for doing so at the airport.  But, the Liverpool Echo reports, Mr Lewis has a way to save you some cash.   The TV favourite says that, while the new short check-in time applies to people who don’t reserve a seat, it can cost as little as just \u0026pound4 to reserve a standard seat with Ryanair. So for families or friends hoping to sit together, or those who can’t check in within the 48hr time limit, this could save you a few headaches. A Ryanair spokesperson said: “Online check-in - for those customers who don’t choose reserved seats - will be available from 48 hours to 2 hours pre-departure for all flights from Wednesday 13 June. “This is more than double the 24-hour check-in period operated by British Airways, Lufthansa, Norwegian and Iberia. This will give reserve seat customers more time to select their preferred seats prior to departure.”  How is it changing? Money Saving Expert’s Martin Lewis explains: “At the moment, you can check in for free up to four days in advance - and this is actually measured in complete calendar days. So if you’re flying at 8pm on Friday, you can check in any time after 00.01am on Monday. From 13 June, the free check-in window’s being cut to 48 hours - so you won’t be able to check in until 8pm on Wednesday. “The change means that if you don’t want to pay for a reservation you’ll have a much narrower window to remember to check in online or via Ryanair’s app - and holidaymakers returning to the UK after even short breaks will need to access the internet abroad to do so.

Two Australians and the British man picked up the sexually-transmitted disease (STD) while having unprotected sex in south-east Asia.  The Brit\u0027s case came to light earlier this year, when Public Health England confirmed he had been infected, before later revealing he had been successfully treated. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) report, published this month, confirmed that two more tourists, both from Australia, picked up the infection.  After chlamydia, gonorrhoea is the second most commonly contracted STD in Europe with 75,000 case confirmed in 2016.    If left untreated it can lead to infertility , ectopic pregnancies and pelvic inflammatory disease.   The report warns that greater collaboration is needed between public health authorities to tackle the issue.  It adds that the cases give significant cause for concern given a lack of alternative treatments. The English patient caught the STD after a one-night stand despite having a girlfriend back home in England. It is feared that incurable gonorrhoea could be on the rise due to a decline in condom use as HIV fears lessen. The ECDC said the cases were the first global reports of gonorrhoea with high-level resistance to vital antibiotics. The British man visited sexual health services in early 2018 but attempts to get rid of the STI with the recommended treatment - a combination of antibiotics azithromycin and ceftriaxone - failed.

The shop, 20th Century Flicks, has kept going despite the rise of streaming services such as Netflix. But times have been tough, and last year it turned a profit of just \u0026pound160. Owner David Taylor now reckons he\u0027s found a new way of boosting business by creating a micro-cinema using his amateur carpentry skills. David has a tiny 11-seat Kino cinema a larger 18-seat Videodrome. The 38-year-old says his shop in the heart of Bristol has around 20,000 films stacked on the shelves. He describes the cinema - which has space for 18 people - as “like a jukebox” with punters browsing the shelves to choose what they want to screen.  David said: “When I started here 16 years ago, DVDs were still around but it was mostly video. We’ve got around 1,500 videos and the rest are DVD and Blu Ray. “There’s VHS stuff you can’t find on DVD, we’ve got a film called The Spider Stratagem which is quite a rare Italian film that never got released apart from video. “There is no way else to see it.” 20th Century Flicks is housed in a 500-year-old building, but every week it brings in ten new release films, including the latest Star Wars and Jumanji.  David said customers often came in to admire the collection or stroke the cat, but sometimes only one or two VHS films would be rented a week. David estimates that a couple of hundred customers come through the door a week to rent films, a number which is doubled by those who come in to go to the cinema. This includes amateur filmmakers showing their work off to pals, hen parties, and groups of film buffs with niche interests. “It is very informal,” David said. “The quality of the picture is very good. I’ve not heard of anyone else doing anything similar. “Some rental shops sell film memorabilia, a bit like Lonely Planet. Some have branched into selling vapes, but I wanted to stay within my area of expertise.”  David and two other members of staff bought out their old boss in 2010. “He just wanted to get away from it, in exchange for us paying an overdue VAT bill,” David said. “We worked for free quite a lot, doing other jobs as well. We paid off the debts and rent and moved out of Clifton about five years ago.  “We made a profit of \u0026pound100 last year after wages. It has been a labour of love.  Everyone just puts in more than they should do, no-one wants to see it struggle.”  He takes pride in helping customers find a film they will enjoy watching, and says it is still cheaper to rent a DVD or Blu Ray film from the shop than through Amazon Prime or another online provider. “We can save them that time of watching something, then switching it off,” he said.    We are less than half the price of rental online.  “Netflix has got so much but they don’t archive stuff. They keep getting rid of it. “Netflix is fine if you don’t really care what you’re watching, you just want to switch off and watch TV. “We are there for people who choose what they want to watch. “They might want to watch all the back catalogue of a director - we’ve got a lot of interest in Clair Denith at the moment. “You wouldn’t be able to find that without using torrents.” "},{"url":null,"title":"who royal wedding bridesmaid sisters","story":"NewsWho are the royal wedding bridesmaid sisters Remi and Rylan Litt and how are they connected to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry ?With the eyes of the world watching them perform their crucial wedding day duties - the youngsters have a fairly big responsibility resting on their little shoulders\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary14:10, 16 MAY 2018NewsRemi Litt, six, and her seven-year-old sister Rylan\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s royal wedding party is set to feature six bridesmaids - and two of them are sisters.

Their mum Benita runs her own brand agency under her name where she helps others to start their businesses. Prior to running her own business as a brand and business developer, Benita worked as an intellectual property and entertainment attorney in California. Darren\u0027s LinkedIn profile describes himself as an experienced investor and entrepreneur. Their daughters make up a total of six bridesmaids on the day. These include Princess Charlotte, Ivy Mulroney, Florence van Custem and Zalie Warren. Zalie is the youngest of the bridesmaids at just two-years-old. Kensington Palace said their dresses and page boy uniforms would be revealed on the day.

Two-year-old Zalie Warren takes the spot as youngest bridesmaid - and is certain to have the eyes of the world watching her as she arrives at Windsor Castle. Obviously, at that age she won\u0027t be aware of the full importance and magnitude of her role on Saturday, but one day Zalie will surely look back at images of her accompanying one of the most famous brides in the world down the aisle - Meghan Markle. But who is the tiny tot whose face will be projected to millions across the globe on Saturday? Zalie - the daughter of Zoe and Jake Warren, who married in 2013 - is Harry\u0027s goddaughter.  She has a twin sister called India, who has not been chosen as a bridesmaid on account of her not being goddaughter to Harry like her sister. The Warren family are well-connected to the Royals through horse racing. Jake, 27, is the son of John Warren, the Queen’s racing manager, and one of Diana\u0027s 17 godchildren. John, whose is an equine expert who buys and sells thoroughbred horses, runs the Highclere Stud - 300 acres of land in Berkshire home to 20 resident mares. The Highclere Stud is located near Highclere Castle, where Downton Abbey is filmed.  His son Jake is one of the closest friends to both Princes Harry and William having gotten close to the boys during the school years. Jake attended Ludgrove preparatory school and Eton College with the boys. Jake\u0027s mother, Lady Carolyn Warren, is the daughter of the late 7th Earl of Carnarvon, a previous racing manager to the Queen and one of her closest confidants. Other bridesmaids include Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi and Rylan Litt and Ivy Mulroney.

Danielle Dick, 32, died peacefully as she lay next to her husband Tyler in her hospital bed. She received the shock diagnosis after she suffered headaches and struggled to speak 17 weeks into her pregnancy. An obstetrician initially thought it was just pregnancy brain. But after she was rushed to A\u0026ampE doctors discovered that she had three masses in her brain, and they were later confirmed to be stage 4 melanoma.  Tyler, from Goddard in the US state of Kansas, is now speaking out to raise awareness about skin cancer and encourage people to protect themselves and get checked. In 2011, he had noticed a strange mole on his wife\u0027s back and a biopsy found that it wasn\u0027t cancerous. But the mole grew back and a biopsy determined it was melanoma.  Tyler, 32, told the Today programme the mole and the lymph nodes were removed and it was believed Danielle, a physical therapist, was in the clear.   She gave birth to the couple\u0027s first child, a daughter named Taylor, in 2015 and fell pregnant with twins in 2016. But in April 2017 she became frustrated when she couldn\u0027t find the right words. They visited an obstetrician, who told them it was probably pregnancy brain, said Tyler, a nurse anesthetist. However, the couple rushed to A\u0026ampE one day when Danielle couldn\u0027t speak at all. An MRI revealed three melanoma masses in her brain. Danielle would have had a 20 per cent chance of surviving five years if she began immediate radiation treatment, but she chose to delay it so her unborn twins would survive.  She eventually took a chemotherapy pill and underwent some pinpoint radiation. The twins - a boy named Colby and a daughter named Reagan - were delivered prematurely via Caesarean section at 29 weeks on July 12 last year, allowing Danielle to begin aggressive treatment. It was too late, however, as the cancer had spread rapidly through her body. Immediate treatment failed to help and doctors later found almost 20 new masses in her brain. The twins remained in neonatal intensive care until they were strong enough to go home.  She underwent full brain radiation but the cancer spread to her spinal cord, and she was transferred to a hospital in Houston, Texas, for further care as her condition deteriorated. Danielle died next to her husband on April 25, just nine months after giving birth. Tyler said doctors will be carrying out tests to find out if the cancer has possibly spread to the twins. He told Today that his best friend was determined to do as much as she could with their three children and remained upbeat, even when she felt ill or exhausted, before she died.  He said: “She never got any breaks. Every time she went to the doctor she got the worst news of her life. It was just shocking how they would get one [tumour] to shrink or go away and another would pop up.” He added: “She loved those babies so much. She also began ticking things off her bucket list, including swimming with dolphins, going to see The Killers in concert and attending college basketball games.

Abdul Baqi, from Nasirabad village in Pakistan\u0027s Balochistan province, on Saturday expressed his desire to his family that he wants to marry a girl he was in relationship with. The 22-year-old asked the family to take an engagement proposal to the girl\u0027s house. But the news did not go down well with his father and brothers. His 70-year-old father Dost Muhammmad and four brothers - Abdul Ghani, Abdul Sattar, Abdul Rehman and Abdul Karim - held him in a room and gouged out his eyes of their sockets.  They locked his mother in another room so that she could not intervene and save her son. Baqi, who is currently admitted in Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre in Karachi, said: I requested my father and brothers that I want to marry a girl I have been in relationship with. My father agreed first. But, three hours later I was taken to a room by my father and four brothers where they tied me to a bed and started taking out my eyes. I kept shouting at them what were they doing? But they didn\u0027t listen to my pleas. Narrating the tragic incident, Baqi said: My father used the back of a spoon to take out my first eye. I saw my eye dangling out of the socket. He then used a knife to cut the veins.  When they removed my first eye, I requested them to leave me now. But they didn\u0027t listen to me at all and removed the other one as well. After they finished, I pleaded to them to please kill me now but they replied they want me be an example for other boys in the village. Abdul Baqi was rushed to a government-run hospital in Quetta by his other siblings, who were informed by neighbours about the incident. From Quetta, he was immediately referred to Karachi\u0027s Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre, where doctors confirmed Baqi won\u0027t be able to see again.

simon murray back to tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to launch an audacious bid to bring back striker Simon Murray to Tannadice.As manager Csaba Laszlo rebuilds almost an entire squad for next term, the striker has been identified as a man who can grab the goals to get them back to the Premiership.The 26-year-old scored 25 times in a two-year spell with the Tangerines before moving to Hibs when his contract expired last summer.Despite scoring 14 times during his first six months at Easter Road, he was loaned out to Dundee for the second half of the campaign.He hit the net three times for the Dark Blues, helping them get vital points as they survived in the top flight.Murray has now returned to the Hibees and has a year left on his contract but the feeling is he will be allowed to leave this summer if another club comes in for him.Dundee could be interested in making his switch to Dens permanent but are understood to be considering other options as well, while Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are eying a move for him. And United are definitely considering taking him back.If a deal comes off, the Dundonian will be one of more than an entire team of new faces fixed up in the coming few months.One stumbling block could be the fact Hibs, despite signing him for free a year ago, are likely to demand a fee.As United’s rebuilding process goes into overdrive, former Hamilton Accies and Partick Thistle full-back Ziggy Gordon is another name under consideration.The 25-year-old has spent the last year-and-a-bit in Poland with Jagiellonia Bialystok, but would welcome a move back to Scotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ae6e6a402efc-726x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united star picked for tunisia world cup squad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United could have a representative at this summer\u0026#8217s World Cup in Russia.Tunisia have named Bilel Mohsni in their provisional squad for the championships, which kicks off on June 14.The 30-year-old has already played for his country six times, including a qualifier for the 2017 African Cup of Nations.If selected for the full squad, the calibre of opposition will be in stark contrast to what he\u0026#8217s come up against this season in the SPFL Championship.He could be getting to grips with the likes of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling for England, while he could also be trying to stop Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne against Belgium.Panama, the final team in Group G, might provide less of a test than the other two.Soon to be out of contract Mohsni has been a standout performer for United since joining in March.Boss Csaba Laszlo said a trip to the World Cup would only benefit the defender.He said previously: “This can be a great development for him.

surrounding the ice arena and Cineworld on several occasions in the last few years.Dundee City Council operates a licensed site for Travellers at Balmuir Wood in Tealing.Twenty pitches are available for Travelling communities, each of which features an electricity supply, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you on themselves.”A council spokeswoman said: ‘‘We are aware of their presence and are monitoring the situation.”Police Scotland was approached for comment but no response had been received by the Tele at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game. It doesn’t matter where I play, goals and assists are where I’ll get judged on at the end of the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"New documentary about Celtic legend Tommy Burns to be made to air on TV this year","story":"                          A NEW documentary about Celtic legend Tommy Burns has been announced on the 10th anniversary of his death."},{"url":null,"title":"Discarded needles and a poo in a sock  Shocking scenes in a Glasgow city centre lane","story":"                          THESE are the shocking images showing the blight of drugs on Glasgow\u0027s streets -

That will rise to \u0026pound42.5 million next year and \u0026pound45.3 million in 2020-21.It is desperately needed, according to those in the front line facing daily calls from struggling Highlanders.Alasdair Christie, manager of the Citizens Advice Bureau in Inverness, Badenoch and Strathspey, said: \u0026ldquoWe see more and more people struggling to be able to afford a home or maintain tenancies.\u0026ldquoA lot of it is down to the fact that they simply don\u0026rsquot have the income to cover the cost of rent and associated living expenses, and the demand greatly outweighs the supply of housing available.\u0026ldquoThe emphasis has to be on more council and housing association rented properties being available.According to Scottish Government statistics, almost 72,500 affordable homes have been added since 2007.Housing Minister Kevin Stewart said affordability was \u0026ldquoabout more than just bricks and mortar, by providing \u0026ldquosafe, warm homes.He said the government was on target to deliver at least 50,000 homes during this parliament through \u0026pound3 billion of investment, of which 35 percent would be for social rent.He is working with councils and housing associations \u0026ldquoto deliver quality homes to meet local needs.Labour regional MSP David Stewart welcomed the extra funding but wants an assurance that the right kind of property is being built.He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquod invest more in good quality council and social housing, with a mixture of home types, ensuring these options were attractive and available to help relieve the pressure so many young people feel about home ownership.Wednesday 16 May 2018 4:41 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04097000/04097386.jpg","title":"Community buyout plans for castle","story":"\u0026nbspBOLD plans for a community buyout of Urquhart Castle visitor centre overlooking Loch Ness \u0026ndash which could generate millions of pounds for the local economy \u0026ndash will be discussed at a public meeting next week.The site, visited by almost half a million people last year, making it one of Scotland\u0027 most popular tourist attractions, is operated by the government agency Historic Environment Scotland (HES).But a community group believes the tourist attraction could generate much-needed funds for local projects ranging from road improvements to supporting a childcare centre if it was run by locals.It wants to explore the possibility of using community asset transfer legislation to acquire the visitor centre, car park and land along with the neighbouring tourist information centre and Loch Ness Homes parkland.The Glen Urquhart Rural Community Association (Gurca) is urging people to give their views at a meeting at Glenurquhart Public Hall, starting at 7.30pm next Tuesday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLoch Ness tourism expert Willie Cameron, a spokesman for Gurca which includes community and business representatives, said there had been some initial meetings to discuss the idea.\"At this stage, it is a proposal,\" he said. \"No action is going to be taken until the meeting when we will find out the will of the people.\"If support was forthcoming, the next step would be to carry out a feasibility study but he believed Urquhart Castle had the potential to bring in revenue for infrastructure projects such as pothole repairs, improved footpaths and cycle ways, as well as supporting local facilities such as the day care centre and a childcare centre.\"We have a cash cow sitting on our doorstep but it seems not a penny is coming into the area,\" he said.\"We have potholes on the A82.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
