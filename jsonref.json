At a photo call in Switzerland, the Prince and Princess of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of York had skied down to have a group photograph. The princess took one look and decided it was all far too tame. “Let’s have a go,” she said to Fergie. The two royal wives proceeded to bang hips and push hard, each trying to dump the other in the snow. This horrified the royal husbands and they had to fight hard to stop them. The cameramen loved it.’JENNI RIVETTPersonal trainer‘I absolutely loved Diana’s sense of humour. She was always playing practical jokes. We had a strict routine at the Harbour Club gym, then suddenly one day she wanted to move to the stretching mat which I thought was odd. When I walked over to her I saw Hugh Grant and Simon Le Bon doing some stretching with her. She just wanted to be on the mat with them and show them how flexible she was. They were all laughing, she was showing them her various exercises and encouraging them to copy her.’JAYNE FINCHERPhotographer         Prince Charles and Diana sharing a laugh on a royal flight to Australia.

She had a great sense of humour and was very good at remembering jokes. She always had a joke up her sleeve and she used to tell quite a few dirty ones. She had a really funny laugh too, it came right from her stomach. Once she saw something funny she was off. That was quite incredible at the time, because royals did not do that.’PATRICK JEPHSONFormer private secretary‘One evening in New York she was coming out of her suite at the Plaza Athenee and the head of her American Secret Service detail was waiting for her. He was very much smitten with the princess, I could tell. That evening she was wearing the most spectacular off-the-shoulder black evening gown. All you could really register was acres of lovely tanned royal skin. She leaned forward and prodded the secret service agent. Under his tuxedo you could see a shape under his shirt. She said, “What’s that?” and the guy said, “Bulletproof vest, Ma’am”. She stepped back in mock horror and said, “Shouldn’t I be wearing that?” That was just typical of her.’DR LILY HUA YUAcupuncturist and herbalist‘She would come twice a week for acupuncture. I have five treatment rooms and Diana always liked to be in room five, which was the biggest treatment room and very light and airy. Sometimes she would invite two or three friends so they could be in neighbouring rooms and have acupuncture together. The insulation wasn’t very good so if I inserted a needle into her friend she would say, “Ow!” and Diana would hear and shout, “Don’t be such a baby.” ’         Diana hitting Prince Charles over the head with a prop glass bottle - one of many practical jokes she pulledMICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘Before an official visit to Spain, there had been rumours of ill health and unhappiness. Filming the princess from behind as she walked down a street in Toledo, her shoulders suddenly started shaking as if she was upset and crying. Members of her party went to her. She kept her face from the camera and I reported that something had happened to make her emotional. I was later told that she had seen something saucy in a shop window and had been trying to stifle her giggles. My report that it was something worse merely made her laugh again.’DR JAMES COLTHURSTDiana’s close confidant and old friend‘When she bought her first car, a blue Honda Civic, I went round to Diana’s with my flatmate at about 11pm and put two L-plates on the car and then tried a string of tins together underneath with enough slack for her to get out of the parking space without disturbing the string, so that when she drove onto Old Brompton Road she was trailing a line of tins behind her. That evening she rang up and I said, “How’s your car?” and she said, “My car’s fine. How’s yours?” I moved to the window and saw my car under the streetlight covered in flour with eggs on top. I had to wash it off quickly, because it goes quite hard. That was fairly much Diana’s line of fun. She was great at one-liners, like when we were on a skiing holiday and I fell asleep with my mouth open. Diana said, “Gosh, James would be a real wower in a goldfish bowl, wouldn’t he?” Her way of phrasing things was funny.’         Diana meeting Australian lifeguards at New South Wales\u0027 Terrigal Beach in 1988JENNI RIVETTPersonal trainer‘We trained in her drawing room at Kensington Palace which was absolutely huge.

Nothing was moving as cars tried to turn right.

When she came out, she slid down the tank and I was standing right there. She said to me, “Unfortunately I couldn’t find any ammunition”.’JAYNE FINCHERPhotographer         Diana and Fergie prodding a friend with an umbrella at Royal Ascot in 1987‘She used to get the giggles about things. In Australia in 1988 we were at Bondi Beach and we thought it would be the archetypal lifeguard on the beach picture. When we got there all these scantily clad lifeguards were lined up to meet her, but then the sponsors decided their swimsuits were too scanty so they told them to put their tracksuit bottoms on. Of course we were all horrified because that wasn’t going to make a good picture.As they put their tracksuit bottoms on, we said we were going to go on strike and not take any pictures. So when Diana arrived we were making them take their trousers off again and she could see all this going on. When she came to the beach she started giggling and didn’t know where to look. She looked everywhere other than at those scanty swimsuits. She was posing in the middle of them and looking up at the sky. She was really flushed and got the giggles again — she didn’t want to look down.’NISH JOSHIHolistic health practitioner‘Kevin Costner kept calling her asking her to act in Bodyguard 2, a sequel to his movie with Whitney Houston. She laughed and laughed when she told me, “He keeps calling me wanting me to play the person the bodyguard protected.” She thought it was so funny.’SARAH BRADFORDAlso known as Viscountess Bangor, royal biographer‘I always felt Diana was wary of Fergie and yet when Fergie was turned down as prospective lady-in-waiting for Diana because she was deemed “most unsuitable”, Diana was furious.         Diana and Prince Charles at Prince William\u0027s confirmation ‘There was always trouble afoot when the two women got together, like on Fergie’s hen night when she and Diana wore grey wigs, dressed up as policewomen and pretended to arrest a “prostitute” outside Buckingham Palace. They were put in a police van and driven down The Mall until one of the policemen recognised Diana. He was so shocked he couldn’t believe it and said, “Oh my heavens, it’s the Princess of Wales!”‘Later they went on to Annabel’s nightclub where they narrowly missed Prince Andrew, but they then succeeded in tricking the policemen on the gates at Buckingham Palace and they shut the gates in Andrew’s face as his car approached. Fearing an ambush, he screeched into reverse. That’s when Fergie wondered if she’d gone too far.‘I’ve not been a fan of Fergie’s and none of this would have occurred to Diana without Fergie’s bad influence. A member of staff said Fergie had her own agenda and used to get Diana into trouble and then disappear.’DARREN MCGRADYPersonal chef‘Because we were a small household it was up to Paul Burrell or me to fill her car up with petrol, because she felt vulnerable at the petrol station. She drove a BMW or a Mercedes. So I would drive out through the gate, the police would salute and I would pull faces. I would fill up the car and drive back but I would notice there were chocolate wrappers in the footwell.‘So while I was cooking her healthy food she was sneaking out and having chocolate bars in the car. Every now and again after returning the car I would say, “Your Royal Highness, here are your keys, but I found these in the car”, and hand her the chocolate wrappers.‘And she would say, “Oh they must be William and Harry’s” and smile. Because she knew that I knew! She liked Drifter bars and Time Outs.’MICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘It was customary to meet the Press at the start of a royal tour. In the British ambassador’s residence in Washington in 1985, the princess stood in the receiving line as familiar faces presented themselves, fresh from covering the Queen’s tour of the Caribbean. “Now, let’s see all these glorious suntans,” cried the princess in triumph. “Not much work has been done in the West Indies, that’s for sure.” I told her it was rust, not suntan, as it had rained throughout the Queen’s tour. “I am sure someone believes that,” said the princess. “But it’s not me”.’         Diana and Prince Charles share a post-polo kiss.

It was a Thursday, Ladies’ Day at Ascot, and these two girls were waving at me. I thought, “Well I can’t know those girls they can’t be waving at me,” so I looked the other way.‘Anyway, later when I was at KP doing a fitting I realised it was Diana and Fergie on their way to Ascot who’d waved at me. Diana said to me, “Are you still riding your bike?” I said, “Oh, yes, yes,” and she said, “I hope it disguises you more than when I go to things!” ’RICHARD YOUNGPhotographer‘I used to go to San Lorenzo restaurant a lot because I knew the owners. I’d be sitting there having lunch on my own — crudites and calamari — and a few times Diana came in to meet friends, and as she walked past my table she’d nick a carrot and say, “Oh, Mr Young, how are you?” ’MICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘Diana was shopping in Harrods in 1996 wearing the most elegant Yves St Laurent trouser suit that accentuated her height. There had been some photographs of her rapidly growing sons in the papers which prompted me to say, “You’ve certainly bred some height into the Royal Family.” She stopped and said, “And good looks, Michael, and good looks!” She wagged her finger to emphasise the point. She was proud of her Spencer genes and antecedents as a direct descendant of King Charles II.’         Former royal photographer Ken Lennox says \u0027Diana was a bold girl, and I think Charles found her too difficult\u0027JAYNE FINCHER Photographer‘She was always a bit suspicious when women reporters came along, new ones that she didn’t know. She’d say, “Oh watch that one, she’ll be fluttering her eyelashes at my security staff. And look, she’s got awful shoes from Russell \u0026amp Bromley.” Woman to woman, we’d laugh about that.’JENNI RIVETTPersonal trainer‘I didn’t realise I was supposed to curtsy to her, and one day we bumped into her best friend Julia Samuel in Kensington Gardens and she curtsied to her. I was a bit surprised, and I asked Julia why she was curtsying to her best friend. She said, “I’m not curtsying to her, I’m curtsying to the Crown and so should you.”‘So the next time I saw Diana I apologised and said, “I believe I’m supposed to curtsy to you — so I owe you four years of curtsies.” She said, “That’s why I love you Jenni, because you’re South African and you don’t know about these things. Don’t worry.” She really took people at face value — she used to take off my accent and talk like a South African, and say things like, “Yeeees Jeeeni”. She was very funny.’KEN LENNOXFormer royal photographer‘Diana was a bold girl, and I think Charles found her too difficult. Whereas Camilla was totally acquiescent to everything Charles wanted or said or did, Diana was a young girl with different ideas. If I turned up at something I wasn’t supposed to turn up to, she would point her finger at me and wag it, but it was always with a smile on her face.       ‘She had absolutely perfect manners and a great sense of giggles too. We used to say, though, that when she was upset about something, her laser eyes would be switched on.’MICHAEL COLEFormer BBC royal correspondent‘Although they did fall out from time to time, and were in or out of favour with the Press, Princess Diana and the Duchess of York were friends from way back and Fergie was always up for any devilment that occurred to Diana, like livening up an afternoon at Royal Ascot by poking the royal equerry Major Hugh Lindsay in the back with their parasols when they spotted him walking along to the paddock.’MICHAEL WHITLAMFormer director general of the British Red Cross‘On a trip to Washington about six weeks before she died she invited me to have tea with her. She had the room below mine and one of the staff came and said, “Diana would like you to join her and the ambassador’s wife for tea.”‘So I went downstairs to where her living room was. She was sitting there with the ambassador’s wife, in her dressing gown and with white stuff all over her face. I, of course, blushed and looked incredibly embarrassed, and they thought this was highly amusing and spent the next two hours ribbing me about it — “Come join the girls,” she said. “Come join the girls for some girly chat”.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Stonehenge tunnel scrapped funding not sorted end year","story":"Share this article Referring in particular to the massively delayed and overbudget Crossrail project he added:‘It will be extremely challenging to deliver the South West road improvements to cost and time.

We sent a Smith of our own along – to see what else Patti, Paul, Bob and Roberta have in commonCan you spot a Smith? Would you like to see one? Maybe you are one – I am. Having the most common surname in the western world makes you a member of a pretty big club. But what kind of art do Smiths create? That’s the focus of a new exhibition that brings together more than 30 creatives – Sir Paul Smith, Patti Smith, Bob and Roberta Smith and more – all united by their surname.So what’s it like being an artist called Smith? Emily Mae Smith, whose work is in the show, explains: “Growing up in a world where the persona of the artist has been made so very important – think of Picasso – I thought: ‘I’m never going to be successful because I have the most boring name in the world! This is never going to work for me … being an artist named Smith is a terrible thing.’“I have included my middle name ever since I was little because it was the only way I could be differentiated,” she says. “But when Marlborough galleries contacted me about the show, I started laughing because being called Smith has suddenly become the opposite of a terrible thing in a very funny, cute way.”John Smith, a film-maker, says his name has shaped his work: “I never quite forgave my parents for giving me this name. But as an artist it probably has had quite an impact on the ideas explored in my work.“Because it’s always been at the back of my mind that I have this kind of embarrassing name, my work revolves around the everyday, and it also plays with notions of truth and lies,” he says. “I’m quite frequently asked if John Smith is my real name.”He has chosen to show a video work, Om, where the viewer sees someone who appears to be a Buddhist monk but then reveals himself to be someone unexpected.Pascal Spengemann, director of Marlborough’s New York gallery, tells me how the show came about. “The artist Maurizio Cattelan told us he’d always wanted to do an exhibition called The Smiths, that has everybody who’s a Smith in it. Right away, I said: ‘we’ll do it.’“It’s like a test of curatorial practice. The show will either look great or like a total hotchpotch The only condition is the name, so it’s a kind of non-selection selection. The premise is a way to circumvent or short-circuit choice it is a great methodology of conceptual art but what the show is remains to be seen, which is exciting and maybe a little nerve-racking.”Its democracy appeals to the artists involved. “As a younger artist, I’m just excited about the proximity to the bigger names,” says Emily Mae. “To have your work in hung with other artists whose work you respect is really important.“A lot of group shows today, someone has just said: ‘hey, here’s some successful people, we’re gonna put them together’, so we might as well actually just be really plain about it. Let’s be plain and Smith about it. There’s a directness to being called Smith, and there’s a directness to saying: ‘Hey, this is what the show is.’”John agrees. “It’s an equaliser, isn’t it? I really like that as an idea, mixing together people who just happen to be called Smith.”The show includes a broad range of media: ink drawings, oil paintings, watercolours, sculpture and video. Bob and Roberta Smith presents a collection of placards entitled Make Your Own Damn Art – a series of statements in defence of arts education that were read aloud to Michael Gove when he threatened to remove arts from the core curriculum Patti Smith’s contribution is a drawing with text. There’s no live performance art though, presumably a reformation of the band the Smiths for the show was out of the question. But were they an influence?The show, however, takes its markers from pretty much any Smith you can think of. Flyers feature a pair of Stan Smiths.

Who would have thought electromagnetism could be so joyful?It’s hard not to use the word “magic” about the art of Takis. A nail floats motionless in space. A cylinder and a ball dance jerkily with each other. Angelic music is played withno sign of a human hand. Yet none of this is the work of the supernatural, nor is Takis trying to fool anyone into thinking that it is. The force that gives his art its innocent joy is part of the fabric of the universe.Magnetism – the phenomenon that Takis, who was born in Athens in 1925, has been making visible since the 1950s – has a long history of being mistaken for magic. Lodestones, with the power to attract ferrous metal, were coveted long before their properties were understood: it was said their spooky pull could be neutralised by garlic.When the scientist Michael Faraday investigated magnetism and electricity in the early 19th century, he didn’t so much dispel the mystery as give it new dimensions by showing how electromagnetism is at the heart of nature. In fact, Faraday made art with magnets a century before Takis. In the 1850s, he scattered iron filings on paper over a magnet and watched them arrange themselves along the lines of its invisible field, preserving the pattern under wax to create readymade “drawings”.Faraday’s fields led in just a few decades to Einstein’s theory of relativity and Takis uses magnetism to make all the mind-boggling phenomena of post-Einsteinian physics, from fields to quantum mechanics, visible. In his 1959-60 Telepainting, three metal cones are suspended on threads in front of a white monochrome canvas. Instead of hanging vertically, they fly horizontally towards it, attracted by strong magnets hidden under its surface. It’s as if a Russian Suprematist abstract painting has come to life.Instead of depicting triangles and cylinders in an imaginary space, Takis constructs a relationship between solid objects in real space – all done with magnets. It’s a trick he never tires of. This gets a bit repetitive as you explore one marvel after another. Another magnet! More nails! Yet it’s charming and thought-provoking as we are shown the hidden forces that create our reality.Telepaintings, Telesculptures: the names of his works from the 1950s and 60s refer to the technological revolution of their day. This was the age of the Telstar satellite and television. Takis has said that when he was a child in Athens, electric streetlights were almost unheard of. When he first visited postwar London, he was entranced by their prevalence.So lighting became his other obsession. Tall slender poles topped with coloured lights are another strand of sculpture he’s been producing since the 1960s. Other luminous works include a black painted box with flashing lights inside it, and a vintage control panel with the lights going on and off. Unfortunately these are period pieces. They’re an interesting insight into 1960s culture, but not living art that can challenge us now.Then again, it’s the very archaism of Takis that makes him lovable. His earliest works here include bronze and plaster statues inspired by ancient figures from Greece’s Cycladic islands. His leap from archaeology to electromagnetism may seem big, but there’s nothing slick or fashionable about what he makes visible. They are simply part of the structure of nature. Takis is not really so different from the Arte Povera movement whose members – including Greek-born Jannis Kounellis – sought in the 1960s to reveal the resilient vitality of oil and wax, wood and (in the case of Kounellis) living animals. Takis embraced the technological age yet he reveals the timeless within it. When all the ice has gone from the north pole, it will still be magnetic.Takis wants to show us the true beauty of the universe and he keeps at it, like a teacher repeating the same lesson until it sinks in. This is a lesson we need more than ever. We’re numbed to technology. It’s part of who we are and we live through it. Yet we don’t stop to savour the scientific intricacy on which our everyday lives depend. Takis is like a curious child who won’t stop investigating what we jaded adults take for granted."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd5f5ef03ea9f94bb93eb03466e7fec7e6894a5b/0_318_4724_2835/master/4724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bda5c174981e7bc8565848d1464df68d","title":"books by darcey steinke katherine angel andrea dworkin review","story":"Steinke’s Flash Count Diary, on the menopause Angel’s Daddy Issues, on fathers in the #MeToo age and Last Days at Hot Slit, a collection of Dworkin’s work, are all “books as actions” Among the epigraphs in Flash Count Diary, Darcey Steinke’s incandescent account of the menopause, is a line from The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir: “The body is not a thing but a situation.” Steinke is being assailed, even menaced by hot flushes. They come with a warning: first an aura, a vertigo-inducing plunge into anxiety, then an explosion of heat. They hit her at work, in bed, bringing insomnia and depression in their wake. They can be generated by the smallest shift in temperature – a plate of scrambled eggs placed too close to her stomach, the door closing on a bus. Lying on her sofa in Brooklyn, “a slab of frozen ham balanced on my forehead”, she recognises that she has become the butt of a cultural joke: the menopausal woman, out of oestrogen, evolutionary roadkill.In Feminine Forever, the 1966 book that kickstarted the popularity of HRT, she finds post-menopausal women described as “castrates” with pathologically dry vaginas. Half a century on, not much has changed. At the 11th European Conference on Menopause and Andropause in Amsterdam, she watches a video about laser treatment to sandblast the menopausal vagina, accompanied by an animation that shows a withered brown rose transform into a tight pink bud. As an Italian doctor dismisses a nurse’s concerns about the breast cancer risk of HRT, she realises “all his descriptions explain how the vagina might feel to an incoming penis”. Is the problem really her body, this ageing animal thing, or a cultural situation that insists women’s value is predominantly sexual or reproductive? And what is the word for this situation? Could it be patriarchy?Patriarchy as a concept was long out of fashion. As Katherine Angel explains in Daddy Issues, her smart, thoughtful essay about the cultural place of fathers in the #MeToo age, it was sunk alongside the corpse of second-wave feminism. “The nineties – decade of girl power, and of an insistence on women’s economic and social freedom, on the condition that women themselves abandon a critique of gender relations – gave invocations of patriarchy, as it gave feminism, a fusty feel, an old-fashioned whiff, conjuring all the age-old stereotypes of feminism: joylessness, sexlessness, uptightness.”Nothing embodies these stereotypes more than the monumental, dungareed figure of Andrea Dworkin, whose alliance with the religious right over the censorship of pornography dealt radical feminism a body blow. Now she too has been brought back into circulation with the timely publication of Last Days at Hot Slit, a selection of her writings that makes a powerful case for her complexity, wit, stylistic originality and political relevance in the grab-’em-by-the-pussy era. Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein: none of it would have surprised Dworkin. “Our enemies – rapists and their defenders – not only go unpunished they remain influential arbiters of morality they have high and esteemed places in society they are priests, lawyers, judges, lawmakers, politicians, doctors, artists.”The body’s situation was her prime territory. Her first husband battered her nearly to death before she escaped him, and her experience of being “just some bleeding thing cut up on the floor” drove all her work. How do you convey the systemisation of violence against women when there is a conspiracy of silence around it, when it is so tolerated and disseminated and sustained as to have merged with the fabric of ordinary reality?Dworkin’s decision, and the reason her writing remains so pungent and uncanny, was to amplify. To go hard. To find a language “more terrifying than rape, more abject than torture, more insistent and destabilising than battery, more desolate than prostitution, more invasive than incest, more filled with threat and aggression than pornography”. Though there’s plenty of material here that’s dated, hyperbolic or plain wrong-headed (like Johanna Fateman, the co-editor of this collection, I’ve often occupied the opposite position to Dworkin, particularly on issues of censorship and sexual freedom), her arguments are more nuanced than the caricatures perpetuated today. Then there’s her weird, electric style. “I want his boot off my neck.” “Carnivorous in its use of women.” “There are no innocent bystanders.” She wrote in 1995: “I have always loved the writing that takes one deep, no matter how strange or bitter or dirty the descent.”Her own eyes had been opened by the publication in 1970 of Kate Millett’s Sexual Politics, a revolutionary analysis of sexual dynamics in literature, which painstakingly revealed that the superstructure of patriarchy was by no means confined to economics or the law, but permeated to the furthest reaches of the culture, infiltrating and informing the domestic and erotic. Nearly 50 years on, it’s both gratifying and troubling that the same technique is still in use, deployed liberally by Steinke and Angel in books that have returned to the contested ground, if not the tone, of radical feminism. Angel assesses fathers in Sally Potter’s film Ginger \u0026amp Rosa, Radio 4’s The Archers and Sarah Moss’s Ghost Wall: narcissistic, self-involved, violently possessive. Both Steinke and Dworkin linger over The Story of O, Dworkin as evidence that men regard women primarily as a zero, a hole – Steinke in regretful post-post-feminist reverie about the erotic charge that submitting to this particular fantasy of abasement could induce.Patriarchy is a totalitarian system. How do you dodge conscription, or evade its all-seeing gaze? Angel, encountering Anthea Hamilton’s exhibition The Squash at Tate Britain, takes pleasure in the “deliciously genderless” nature of the creature – the performer in the squash-like costume. It has no eyes, or even a true face, but the “beautiful, bulbous, obscene” head nevertheless seems to turn and take her in. What a relief to have an encounter in which gender plays no part. On a whale-watching trip, Steinke likewise experiences a “dilation” of her sense of self when she’s miraculously eyed by Granny, the post-reproductive matriarch who leads three pods of killer whales in the Pacific.Animals are a way of thinking about the “thingness” of bodily existence without getting tangled up in the situations of human politics and culture. Androgyny, too, offers a way of refusing assigned and harmful gender roles. Catching a glimpse of herself in a window, Steinke first sees an old man and relishes the ungendering of age, the falling away of her visual identity as a woman. Reading trans memoirs by Juliet Jacques and Max Wolf Valerio, she luxuriates in a sense of gender as fluid, a hormonal tide between two poles, along which we all bob and drift, sometimes making drastic crossings and sometimes remaining tethered in place (being a white, cis, middle-class woman no doubt makes those crossings more alluring and less perilous than they actually are). Dworkin, too, advocates the destruction of the essentialist gender binary, writing in a utopian flourish: “Androgyny … may be the one road to freedom open to women, men, and that emerging majority, the rest of us.”The family tends to be where gender roles are inculcated and maintained, and both Dworkin and Steinke fret in particular over their mothers, the enforcers of impossible standards of beauty and behaviour. Dworkin’s mother, Sylvia, could not brook conflict and regarded independent thought as sinister revolt. Dworkin believed that stopping loving her was among the greatest achievements of her life. Steinke, awake night after night in the furnace of flushes, goes to work on the memory of her dead mother like a burying beetle. She remembers that on their final evening together, her mother pulled out a picture of Steinke aged 49, getting married for the second time. She wore a pink dress, and, though underneath she had on a thick beige bodysuit and control-top tights, her mother swears that in the photograph her pubic hair is showing. Shame: passed between women down generations, a technique of control that brings no more pleasure to the enforcer than the recipient.These stories matter, both to the inidual who experienced them and as cultural tendencies, but I can’t help wondering whether the logic of exposure might not be quite as powerful as Dworkin hoped back in 1973, the year her first book, Woman Hating, was published. What is the point of revealing the embedded presence of patriarchal ideology (another lost word) in books and family histories when an undisguised misogynist is the president of the US, and abortion rights, one of the first victories of second-wave feminism, are being obliterated? As Angel says, the telling of stories held so dear by the #MeToo movement, the desire to call out injustice, might actually reinforce what it seeks to pull down, since “the evidence of swaggering cruelty may both gratify and solidify the fantasy of dominance”.This doesn’t mean there’s no point in writing. Writing the self, Angel observes, is not just to do with catharsis or narcissistic revelation. It’s a route towards iniduation: the process of encapsulating what the self is, and of expelling what it’s not. Drawing on Jacques Lacan and on Donald Winnicott (whose relative freedom from misogyny has made him a linchpin in contemporary autotheory, from Alison Bechdel’s Are You My Mother to Maggie Nelson’s The Argonauts), she describes the mirror stage of psychoanalysis, the process by which the infant gains a sense of itself as separate through the mirror of the parent’s gaze. If the child is rejected, if their affection is coerced, if their aggression is forbidden, then the child will be trapped in a false self. But if the parent can withstand the child’s aggression and remain undestroyed, then the infant will have the immeasurable gift of feeling real. Not everyone will achieve this in childhood, but the work of writing offers a second chance.Maybe feeling real sounds like a luxury. It’s not. As a battered wife, Dworkin was hit with an iron bar, burned with cigarettes, punched in the breasts, her head smashed repeatedly into a concrete floor, but the worst thing she experienced was the isolation of being disbelieved, of being unable to convince anyone – friends, family, neighbours, police, doctors – to help. That was the nadir: “the pure and consuming madness of being invisible and unreal”.In the activist tradition from which Dworkin hails, writing an experience down is a way of reclaiming reality. Making something visible – rape, domestic violence, racism, misogyny – is the precursor to action, since if these things cannot be seen and, crucially, realised as shared, communal, and therefore political, then they are not available for transformation. Writing is the first step to political change. “I want writers to write books as actions,” she declared in Woman Hating. A generation on, Steinke too explicitly frames writing as resistance: “I wanted to fight back, resist how the culture stigmatises and denigrates menopausal women.”If hope of change is what drove Dworkin’s crusade, one of the most distressing aspects of Hot Slit is how she came to lose her faith. She had been raped many times. For a decade she gave a speech called “Rape Atrocity”, and for a decade women came up to her afterwards and told her what had happened to them: in an alley, asleep in bed, in a factory, a stockroom, a school, until she could no longer bear it and stopped giving the speech. And then in 1999, at the age of 52, she was raped again in a hotel room in Paris, only this time a date-rape drug was used and she had no recollection of the attack, just artefacts: a bruise on her breast, a bloody gouge on her thigh. She wrote about it in the New Statesman and many people did not believe her. In many ways, it was the nail in the coffin of her reputation.After her death of myocarditis in 2005, a 24,000-word document on her computer called “My Suicide” was found and part of it is republished here for the first time. In it, she wrote down what this abiding unreality had cost her. Her whole model of political change depended on memory and witness testimony. Without it, she was sunk. She described the death of her optimism, the nightly dreams that the husband she hadn’t seen in decades was going to kill her, that she was once again and permanently a prisoner of his brutality. The now of trauma, the impossibility of there ever being anything other than this encompassing, annihilating reality.This is what was in her mind in her final years: total desperation. Thinking that every person was like a lake with a beautiful surface, only once you went down into it, it was slimy and evil. Every person. She remembers hurting her dog and hates herself. She writes: “How could anyone be so stupid and so mean?” This was the woman who had studied human violence and degradation all her life, in the fierce belief that shining a light on it would bring about change, who had said of herself as an exuberant child, assaulted for the first time at nine: “I wanted to touch everything and do everything. This was my optimism … It’s a refusal to be afraid of life. Girls aren’t supposed to have it.”• Flash Count Diary: A New Story About the Menopause by Darcey Steinke is published by Canongate (RRP £16.99).

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“I’ve had a bit of a reading glitch the past number of weeks and had been unable to make much headway with whatever I picked up,” says captainlego. But Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast and a trip to Paris solved the problem:I thoroughly enjoyed his recollections of his time in Paris in the early to mid 1920s. As luck would have it I was staying in the 5th Arrondissement, which is where he mainly lived during this period so it was wonderful to be walking the same streets and stopping off in the same cafes.New York in 1872 has grown to a population of almost a million. A freelance journalist goes missing after telling his editor that he just seen his own father, who died the year before, though he had no sort of relationship with him, a man who had earned his fortune running slave boats along the Atlantic Coast. Always there is the spectre of corruption, of bribery and extortion headed by the gangster Boss Tweed. As gripping as the plot is, NY itself is very much the star of the show, a place imprisoned in thuggish corruption, where the police conspire with, rather than against, crime, a maze of alleyways crawling with the street-urchins who survive on the city’s garbage, darting beneath the wheels of carriages, acting as newspaper-sellers, and loitering at the edge of squalid saloons. It is brought wonderfully to life in his writing.Meanwhile, nina1414 takes us to the Dodecanese with Lawrence Durrell and his Reflections On A Marine Venus: A Companion To The Landscape of Rhodes:The best bits were about Durrell and his companions and life on the island of Rhodes when he was sent there in May 1945. They were delightful. My favourite phrase was “ferociously unshaven gentlemen”. I don’t know why - but I was taken by that.At the end, there is a calendar of flowers and saints. And a footnote acknowledges the help of Dr Theodore Stephanides - the Theodore of Corfu, I assume. For some silly reason, it made me happy to see his name. He was such a nice character in the Gerald Durrell books and, from what I can gather, well respected by his fellow Greeks as an academic.The Devil’s Diary by Patrick McGinley has delighted BaddHamster:Set in Donegal in the 1980s it tells of strange goings on in a seaside town. A priest disapproves of modernity and the introduction of a cash economy. His mysterious brother returns from overseas and may or may not be a little mad. And there’s something shady about their childhood days. Beautifully written, you can practically smell the turf fires and the seaspray and a creepy plot that threatens horror with every turn of the page. I’d never read McGinley before, but I’m delighted to make his acquaintance now and roam the spooky hills after dark where all manner of shenanigans may be transpiring, just out of sight.ID583532 “wasn’t looking forward” to reading Welcome to Lagos by Chibundu Onuzo, “but I did and how glad I am that I did”:It was a terrific read! I loved the detail and vibrancy of the description of life in the city of Lagos, the delta and rural regions. The characterisation was excellent and the dynamics of the relationships engaging and convincing. There was no happy ending as such (and how could there be?), but the ending was largely positive and the message hopeful.This year’s Man Booker Prize International winner, Celestial Bodies by Jokha Alharthi, has intrigued Rex Bowan:It started by reminding me of The Waves but by the end, with the village, the confusing shifts in perspective, the barrage of history and madness revealed at the end of the book, it brought Faulkner to mind even more. I was pleased to read something experimental but I didn’t feel like my understanding or knowledge of Oman grew as a result of reading it.Finally, Vicc is “slowly reading” The Narrow Road to the Interior by Matsuo Bashō translated by Sam Hamill:Such a joy. A few words painting wonderful pictures of Japan in the 17th century. Calming and serene with beautiful haiku. Even the difficulties and sadness are something Bashō accepts:Through nine hellish days of heat and rain, all my old maladies tormenting me again, feverish and weak, I could not write. Altair meets Vega tomorrow - Tanabata - already the night is changedWhat an antidote to the world of today.That does indeed sound like a tonic.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

If Markit’s PMI report is accurate, Britain’s next prime minister could inherit an economy half-way into recession.The authors of a respected economic survey are predicting the UK economy contracted in the second quarter of the year, raising fears of a potential recession ahead.If such a performance was to be confirmed by official statistics - and then the economy failed to achieve growth in the current third quarter - it would leave the country in a technical recession ahead of its next Brexit deadline of Halloween.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement \u0026amp Supply, fears that an autumn general election could drive the UK economy deeper into the mire.Here’s his take on today’s gloomy PMI report:“Service sector growth slid back last month reversing the small gains made in May, as the wave of political uncertainty and weakening economy continued to undermine confidence and the appetite for new orders. “This unwillingness to spend and invest by clients and consumers resulted in service companies upping the ante to compete for dwindling business opportunities. With the softest rise in prices charged to customers in three months, firms hesitated to increase their own prices for fear of losing ground in the marketplace. “However, staff hiring at some companies went against the grain in this stagnating backdrop, as the rate of new job hires rose to its highest since August 2017. Service providers either built up their workforces in anticipation of a speedy political resolution, but others opted for the status quo fearful of a prolonged period of indecision. “With a dampened mood across the sector, if a General Election is also thrown into the pot of political turmoil in the coming months, then the sector runs an even greater risk of following the manufacturing and construction sectors into cutbacks, cost-cutting and reduced workforces.” Many of the companies interviewed by Markit warned that they are running short of new work to keep their staff busy, as they complete existing contracts.Uncertainty over Brexit, and over who will replace Theresa May as prime minister, appears to be hurting the economy. Some companies fear that “domestic political uncertainty and subdued global economic conditions” would continue to hold back corporate spending. Today’s PMI survey is very worrying -- it suggests the UK economy has suffered its second-worst month since the financial crisis!NEWSFLASH: Britain’s service sector slowed to near stagnation last month, as the wider private sector went into contraction.That’s according to Markit’s latest survey of UK purchasing managers, just released, which suggests the UK contracted slightly in the April-June quarter.Service providers reported that business activity was “close to stagnation in June”, Markit says, with subdued client demand and a further reduction in “work-in-hand”. This dragged the Services PMI, which tracks activity in the sector, down to just 50.1, from 51 in May. That’s the lowest reading in three months, and virtually the 50.0 mark separating expansion from contraction.But there’s worse news too. We learned earlier this week that manufacturing and construction both contracted month. Add in the services data, and it appears that the UK private sector shrank in June for the first time since 2016 - just after the EU referendum.Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit, explains: “The near-stagnation of the services sector in June is one of the worst performances seen over the past decade and comes on the heels of steep declines in both manufacturing and construction. Collectively, the PMI surveys indicate that the economy has slipped into contraction for the first time since July 2016, suffering the second-steepest fall in output since the global financial crisis in April 2009. “The latest downturn has followed a gradual deterioration in demand over the past year as Brexit-related uncertainty has increasingly exacerbated the impact of a broader global economic slowdown. Risks also remain skewed to the downside as sentiment about the year ahead is worryingly subdued, suggesting the third quarter could see businesses continue to struggle. Data firm Markit has some good-ish news for Christine Lagarde -- the eurozone economy strengthened a little last month.Its Eurozone PMI composite Output Index has risen to 52.2, up from 51.8 in May. That’s the highest reading since November 2018, signalling a pick-up in economic growth of the single currency area. But the recovery is being driven by the service sector, with manufacturing contracting.Several City economists and analysts are expressing concerns over Christine Lagarde’s suitability to run the European Central Bank.The problem, as mentioned earlier, is her lack of experience at the sharp end of monetary policy.Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank reckons Philip Lane, the ECB’s new chief economist, will have to do a lot of heavy lifting on economics. Reid told clients this morning:Given her relative inexperience with the ECB’s (complicated) policy toolkit, there is a credibility risk, especially if and when things get more complicated economically, but markets will like the fact that she is a skilled and well connected political operator.The euro weakened a touch in response to the announcement, possibly reflecting the fact that a more hawkish inidual was not chosen. It’s probable that the intellectual economic legwork will now need to be carried solely by Chief Economist Lane, the only trained economist at the top of the new leadership team (recently-appointed Vice President de Guindos is, like Lagarde, a lawyer by training). That said, a lawyer could prove to be useful in the current environment, with the focus on the legal limits of ECB asset purchases, “disenfranchisement,” the risk of debt restructurings, and the prohibition on monetary financing of governments.Erik Nielsen, chief economist at Italy’s UniCredit, is also worried that Lagarde isn’t trained in monetary policy.He told Bloomberg TV that Lagarde was a very intelligent person, and a great communicator, knows how to run big organisations:In normal times she’d be fine, but it is not quite normal times now.She is not known to have engaged in a monetary policy discussion at G7 level.What if, or when, a downturn or a crisis comes, who does she rely on, without her own educational framework or experience at a central bank?Marc Ostwald of ADM Investor Services worries that the European Central Bank would be more ‘politicized’ under Christine Lagarde, rather than sticking strictly to monetaryThe appointment of Lagarde as ECB president will a) raise questions about politicization of the role, above all because b) in sharp contrast to Draghi, Lagarde does not have any background in economics or indeed monetary policy formulation.By extension this puts even greater emphasis on finding a successor for the excellent, always thoughtful and extraordinarily Benoit Coeure as director of operations - who would have been the ideal choice as Draghi’s successor.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, points out that Lagarde does have other powerful skills, which she’ll need to run the ECB.If confirmed – Lagarde would be the first ECB president ever without any experience in monetary policy. We think her management experience, including time as chairwoman of the IMF, would help her to lead the ECB as an institution.However, Lagarde will likely face many challenges along the way. While the IMF chief is considered a qualified candidate, that won’t necessarily make Europe a more attractive place to invest over a tactical horizon.”European stock markets are also rallying, matching the gains in the bond market, following Lagarde’s nomination.Banks are lagging, though (as a Lagarde-led ECB isn’t likely to help their profits by raising interest rates).I imagine that bonds would be moving the other way if EU leaders had chosen Germany’s Jens Weidmann as the new ECB president.Weidmann has been a persistent critic of Mario Draghi’s money-printing policies, and thus more inclined to raise interest rates or resist further stimulus move.Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group, explains:Lagarde, who has built a solid experience fighting against the never-ending financial crisis, is expected to walk on Mario Draghi’s dovish footprints to help the Euro area coping with the weakening global economy.Her nomination also means that Bundesbank’s more hawkish Weidmann is left out, which is good news for Bund investors. Investors are expecting Christine Lagarde to take a similar approach to Mario Draghi, explains Frederik Ducrozet, a strategist at Pictet Wealth Management.“We have to admit that we didn’t see this coming, especially after she strongly denied being a candidate last year.She should provide continuity after Draghi, an important driving factor for markets. The ECB’s reaction function is unlikely to change dramatically under Lagarde’s presidency.”Boom! Belgium’s 10-year government bond yield has just plunged below zero for the first time ever.This comes as French and German bond yields also tumble deeper into negative territory, as the eurozone bond rally gathers pace.This suggests investors are optimistic that Christine Lagarde will take a dovish approach to running the ECB..... and are pessimistic about growth and inflation prospects.Here’s Reuters take on this morning’s market action:Government bond yields in much of the euro zone fell to fresh record lows on Wednesday, after European Union leaders agreed to name France’s Christine Lagarde as the new head of the European Central Bank.Analysts expect Lagarde to continue current ECB chief Mario Draghi’s dovish policy stance. If approved by the European parliament, Lagarde would succeed Draghi when his term expires at the end of October.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.At the start of this week, you’d have got decent odds on Christine Lagarde becoming the eurozone’s top central banker.She certainly wasn’t seen as a front-runner to become the next president of the European Central Bank -- Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann or Banque de France governor François Villeroy de Galhau were more likely candidates.But when the dust finally cleared in Brussels yesterday, after days of tough negotiations between EU leaders, the head of the International Monetary Fund emerged as the chosen successor to Mario Draghi.Lagarde’s nomination is part of a package that finally breaks male dominance of Europe’s top institutions, with Germany’s defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen nominated to head the European commission.Investors are reacting to Lagarde’s nomination by piling into eurozone government bonds. They’re calculating that the ECB will continue offering easy money and record low interest rates on Lagarde’s watch, rather than tightening monetary policy soon.This is driving bond prices to fresh highs, forcing down the interest rate (or yield) even lower.Lagarde will join the ECB at a crucial time (assuming MEPs approve her appointment). With growth weakening and inflation low, policymakers are already pondering what fresh stimulus measures are needed.“I am honored to have been nominated for the Presidency of the European Central Bank.In light of this, and in consultation with the Ethics Committee of the IMF Executive Board, I have decided to temporarily relinquish my responsibilities as Managing Director of the IMF during the nomination period.”But, there’s already concern in the markets about Lagarde’s appointment. Although she’s run the IMF for several years, and also served as France’s finance minister, she is undoubtedly not a central banker. Before entering politics she served as a lawyer, not an economist. Now, a legal background didn’t stop America’s Jerome Powell becoming head of the US Federal Reserve. Lagarde was also one of the key figures (for good or ill) through the eurozone crisis, so knows the challenges facing the ECB well.But will she provide the same leadership as Draghi, who famously saved the euro in 2012 with a ground-breaking stimulus programme, in the face of firm opposition from hawkish colleagues.Investors may question whether Lagarde can be trusted to do “whatever it takes” when the next crisis comes.....New PMI surveys from Markit will show how the world’s service sector companies fared last month. With manufacturing struggling, and global trade under pressure, services is doing a lot of heavy lifting for the global economy. Eurozone and US services firms will probably report slower growth, while the UK could be lacklustre.We also get a flurry of US data, ahead of tomorrow’s 4th July celebrations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8967b82fa193026fb90d0ac4fd30a8be0ca78f45/271_4_4142_2485/master/4142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe1ed6f9d907e22d9e8037cb0749bbf","title":"zdenek hrib the czech mayor who defied china taiwan","story":"By refusing to expel a Taiwanese diplomat, the Prague mayor has joined the ranks of local politicians confronting contentious national policiesZdeněk Hřib had been Prague’s mayor for little more than a month when he came face-to-face with the Czech capital’s complex entanglement with China.Hosting a meeting with foreign diplomats in the city, Hřib was asked by the Chinese ambassador to expel their Taiwanese counterpart from the gathering in deference to Beijing’s ‘one China’ policy, under which it claims sovereignty over the officially independent state of Taiwan.Given recent Chinese investments in the Czech Republic, which have included the acquisition of Slavia Prague football club, a major brewery and a stake in a private TV station, the fledgling mayor could have easily agreed. Prague city council had, under the preceding mayor, signed a twin cities agreement with Beijing that explicitly recognised the one China policy.Instead, Hřib refused and the Taiwanese diplomat stayed.The episode is a rare case of a local politician defying the might of a global superpower while making a principled stand against a national government policy that has promoted Chinese ties.It also adds him to the ranks of mayors who have confronted contentious national policies, including US Democrats such as Bill de Blasio of New York and Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who have opposed the anti-immigration drive of the US president, Donald Trump, and declared their fiefdoms sanctuary cities.Closer to home, Hřib’s conduct invites comparison with the late mayor of Gdańsk, Paweł Adamowicz, after whom he renamed a Prague street following Adamowicz’s murder in January. Adamowicz offered his city as a haven for refugees and adopted liberal positions at odds with the hardline policies of Poland’s conservative Law and Justice party (PIS) government.Hřib has since gone further, demanding Beijing officials drop the clause stating Prague’s support for the one China policy in the 2016 deal and threatening to scrap the arrangement if they refuse.“This article is a one-sided declaration that Prague agrees with and respects the one China policy and such a statement has no place in the sister cities agreement,” Hřib said in an interview in Prague’s new town hall, close to the city’s historic tourist district, which draws an increasing number of visitors from China.“The one China policy is a complicated matter of foreign politics between two countries. But we are solving our sister cities relationship on the level of two capital cities.”Hřib, a 38-year-old doctor who spent a medical training internship in Taiwan, is challenging the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, who has visited China several times, installed a Chinese adviser at his office in Prague castle and declared that he wanted to learn “how to stabilise society” from the country’s communist rulers.The dispute has catapulted the unassuming Hřib to household name status in Czech politics, helped by Prague’s position as an international cultural draw and its outsize share of national resources.Hřib’s rise from obscurity is striking because Czech mayors, unlike their US and Polish counterparts, are not directly elected. He became mayor of a coalition administration after his Pirate party, a liberal group with roots in civil society, finished second in last October’s municipal elections.He says he is merely adopting the policy of his party and its two coalition partners in taking decisions that are cooling Prague’s relations with Beijing.In March, his administration restored the practice of flying the Tibetan flag from Prague’s town hall, reinstating a tradition begun in the era of the Czech Republic’s first post-communist president, Václav Havel, that was dropped by the previous city administration. At the same time, in a move tailor-made to infuriate Beijing, Hřib hosted the visiting head of Tibet’s government-in-exile, Lobsang Sangay.An official visit to the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, followed. During the visit, Hřib criticised China for harvesting organs from political prisoners belonging to the Falun Gong movement.Threats of retaliation came soon afterwards. A planned tour of China by the Prague Philharmonia in September is in jeopardy after it rebuffed Beijing’s demands to repudiate the mayor.Iva Nevoralova, the orchestra’s spokesperson, likened the request to the actions of Czechoslovakia’s former communist regime, which pressured artists to denounce Havel’s dissident Charter 77 movement as the price for being allowed to perform.Speaking to the , Hřib questioned whether Prague’s arrangement with Beijing was a fair relationship and criticised China’s “social scoring” system for good citizenship. He suggested that investment from Taiwan, with its western-style democracy and record of technological innovation, offered greater benefit.The mayor has won praise for restoring the Czech Republic’s image as a champion of human rights and self-determination at a time when its politics have been dominated by the populist messages of Zeman and Andrej Babiš, the anti-immigration billionaire prime minister.“It is empowering to see that a mayor of Prague can have a principled position, despite large portions of the Czech political establishment being co-opted by the narratives spread by the totalitarian government of China,” said Jakub Janda, executive director of the European Values thinktank, which monitors anti-western influence in Czech politics and beyond.Jiří Pehe, the director of New York University in Prague, said Hřib was using the mayor’s office to reassert the values of Havel, who died in 2011. “Everyone in this country knows that when you support Taiwan and Tibet, you’re saying exactly what Havel used to say,” said Pehe. “This was intentional on the part of the Pirate party as soon as he took over Prague. They are saying that the Czech Republic has a special history of fighting against communism and you should respect it.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6480461ef1d8c7c3ca3d68cdd2c7f51d95f2332/0_8_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bd01e8077c931516ca5d4874fef1692","title":"deep seabed off limits mining companies","story":"We still know so little about the wonderful world at the bottom of the oceans. Sending in giant bulldozers is a terrible ideaWhen I was filming Blue Planet Live, I was struck by just how much of the ocean has been altered by humans. From industrial fisheries ensnaring ocean giants in kilometres-long lines, to finding our trash at some of the deepest parts of the ocean: it’s clear that however vast the seas are, we are causing profound harm.Yet at this point in history, when the oceans are facing more pressures than ever before, a secretive new industry is seeking to move into the deep sea, the largest ecosystem on the planet, to start mining for metals and minerals.They want to send gigantic bulldozers, decked out with rotating grinders and mammoth drills straight out of Robot Wars, into the deepest parts of the ocean, disturbing the home of unique creatures and churning up vital stores of carbon. This is quite clearly an awful idea.As someone fascinated by weird and wonderful wildlife, the deep sea is a dream come true. Stoplight loosejaws, bearded sea-devils and vampire squid are just a few of the fantastically named creatures that make the deep ocean their home.On practically every mission down to the deep, scientists discover new species. We know more about the surface of Mars and the moon than about the bottom of the ocean. Mining the deep sea sounds just as ludicrous as mining the moon.And the damage won’t stay hidden in the depths. Toxic pollution from mining operations could travel hundreds or even thousands of miles, impacting the broader ocean food chain. And by disturbing the natural processes that store carbon in deep-sea sediments, deep-sea mining could even make climate change worse. When a million species are already at risk of extinction and climate change is fundamentally altering our planet – why would we sink to new depths, and make it all worse?In fact, with little to no public debate, a handful of governments and corporations have been parcelling up over a million square kilometres of the international seabed to explore for mining potential. As a new report by Greenpeace reveals, there’s very little standing between the natural wonders of the deep ocean and the mining machines: the agency responsible for regulating deep-sea mining (the International Seabed Authority) is putting profit over protection and has never turned down a single licence application.We’ve already seen the huge destruction ravaged upon our planet by corporations mining on land. Are we really prepared to give the go-ahead to the mining industry expanding into a new frontier, where it will be even harder for us to scrutinise the damage caused?Over the next year, governments are negotiating a Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations, which could agree the framework to put huge swathes of our oceans off-limits to exploitation, and raise the bar for any industrial activity in the global oceans: putting protection at the heart of how we manage international waters and the life-support system they provide for us all. The oceans and the stunning and downright bizarre creatures that live there have an incredible ability to regenerate – but only if we let them be.Yet with industries such as deep-sea mining keen to keep their business unrestricted by environmental protections, it will be an uphill battle to secure a strong global agreement. This is a fight for all of us. The global oceans are legally classified as the common heritage of humankind. That means they belong to us all, including future generations.Oil companies ploughed on to cement themselves in the global political economy despite the risks of climate change. Now the deep-sea mining industry is hoping to establish itself, despite catastrophic risks. Minutes of an industry meeting released to Greenpeace under the Freedom of Information Act reveal that “All agreed that environmental concerns are the biggest blocker to progress.”Well the game’s up. Sending massive destructive machines into the deep ocean that we know so little about is quite clearly a terrible idea.

In a 2018 op-ed for the Financial Times, Brûlé argued that people who send such messages are “out of step with the ways of the modern working world” and probably have a “fondness for wearing sweatpants”.

Chas Newkey-Burden meets the children getting involvedOn a five-a-side football pitch, a short stroll from the Arsenal stadium, local kids are falling in love with sport. But it’s cricket, not football, that has them buzzing.For the past four years, thanks to the Islington Chance to Shine Street Youth project, Mikey Thompson has run weekly sessions at this north London leisure centre for the Eritrean Youth Club.Holding classes all year round, whatever the weather – including snow – the Islington setup is a far cry from the sleepy sun-kissed village greens often associated with the game.Thompson, 55, is known as the godfather of inner-city cricket. He says his mission is simple: “to put a bit of joy back on to kids’ faces”.It’s working. The children are enraptured by his down-to-earth approach, which relies on simple drills to teach them the basic disciplines of cricket. As the sun shines, the kids support one another, screams of joy keep going up, and the smiles are everywhere.Eight-year-old Sesen says her favourite part of cricket is the batting. “It feels so nice when I hit the ball because the bat really vibrates in my hands!”But there is another reason why she enjoys picking up the bat. “It makes my hands more steady,” says Sesen. “This is important, because when I grow up I want to be an artist and then my hands will have to be still, so my art doesn’t go all wiggly.”Winta, also eight, says that the sessions have helped her emotionally. “It helps me feel more confident in life,” she says. “If I’m a bit upset in the middle of the week, I just think about cricket and it immediately makes me feel better.”The project has the “open to all” ethos of its backer, Chance to Shine, a charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through the game of cricket. Chance to Shine’s main partner, NatWest, also has a long history of supporting grassroots cricket, facilitating schemes to assist communities and to show iniduals that anyone can play, no matter their level of experience.Hiyab, 12, personifies this. He says that when he first came to the sessions, he knew nothing about cricket and wasn’t even sure whether he would be able to play it. “But now I’ve got really confident because I did better than I expected,” he says, with a big grin.Hanan, 10, is also “surprised” by how well he did when he started going along. Before he knew it he was being picked for his school cricket team he now dreams of playing in the Olympics one day.Nine-year-old Selina thinks more children should get involved in cricket, whatever their circumstances or knowledge of the game. “They can still try it,” she says. “It’s so much fun once you start.”Thompson believes the key to the fun of the sessions is for him to channel his inner child. “If you don’t go into their world, you’ve lost them,” he says.He sweeps aside cricketing jargon to produce an experience that captivates children, drawing on decades of coaching and playing involvement, as well as his experiences coaching the blind and those with other disabilities.Thompson fine-tuned his approach when he ran a project in Hackney. “We went into some serious estates where it was all concrete,” he remembers. “I knew that old-fashioned cricket coaching simply wouldn’t work there – the children would have just walked away.”So he introduced tape-ball cricket and speedy, 20-ball games. Nodding at the nearby football stadium, he says that he injected some of football’s speed and excitement to lure inner-city children away from that game and towards cricket.He is full of praise for the support of his charity backer. “Chance to Shine is one of the most wonderful, wonderful things that has ever happened to cricket,” he says. “If it wasn’t for Chance to Shine, state school cricket would be dying.”It is people like Thompson who keep it alive. He believes that, taught correctly, cricket can be “a vehicle to steer children away from crime and antisocial behaviour and towards the right paths”.A passionate, tireless worker, he now hopes to get government backing to take his work into young offenders’ institutions – something Chance to Shine is also looking in to. “I think I could really help,” he says. “I’d like to use cricket to steer young offenders away from crime and get them off welfare.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

A story of gender and power in theatre, Sarah Henley and Tori Allen-Martin claim they conceived the show, which is billed as a creative collaboration between the actor Idris Elba and the director Kwame Kwei-Armah.After four years working on the project they were dropped, they said, and then went through eight months “where we questioned everything and felt bullied and silenced”.They continued: “For us it’s been devastating proof of the way doors are shut on women, and on the underdogs. We became completely disposable because we’re not famous or important enough. We were expected to shut up, lie down, and take it.”Tree, which is a fusion of music, drama and dance, is being touted as one of the highlights of the festival, opening on Thursday before a run at London’s Young Vic in August.Elba’s Green Door Pictures company, the Young Vic and the festival (MIF) said in a joint statement they were “deeply saddened” to read the online article. All three were “passionate about supporting and nurturing emerging talent within the creative industry from the widest variety of backgrounds” and were “committed to ensuring fair representation on stage and behind the scenes”.They said they appreciated that Henley and Allen-Martin “were involved in exploring ideas for a project based on Idris’s original concept”, but “the truth of the matter is that MIF and Green Door did not feel their proposed direction was artistically viable. It was decided by these producers that the show needed to go in a very different direction with a new writer attached, using Idris Elba’s original concept as the starting point.”The added: “Several offers were made to Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley to discuss the future of the show, and how the producers could continue working with them, which they declined.”Henley and Allen-Martin, writing on the online publishing platform Medium, said the show was based on their work. “We put four years of work into that project, and the majority of those involved read our script, our proposal documents, our premise, and our synopsis – there is no way it’s a ‘different project’, no matter how much it’s changed.”The two writers said they had consulted lawyers and decided it would be too expensive to take the case to court. They said Tree’s producers had “continued to make financial offers to ‘buy us off’”.The show’s producers rejected that characterisation, saying offers were made in the spirit of reaching a compromise. They also denied a breach of any legal obligation, saying “Despite attempts by the producers to resolve the issue with them, they decided to instruct solicitors.”Henley and Allen-Martin said the most pressing issue was paying legal fees of £5,000 and have set up a donations page online to raise the money. Anything above that £5,000 figure will go towards a new organisation the pair have set up called Burn Bright, with the aim of driving positive change for female writers.He expressed sympathy for the two writers but rejected their version of events. “I understand the pain of being ‘released’ from a project. It has happened to me, and it cuts deep.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/282da622d2960423ad18df03f88a8ff785b17d6b/0_246_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68aec9b32cb669444231a578c4852378","title":"brexit putting pupils off modern foreign languages","story":"Teachers report shift in attitudes since referendum as well as complaints about harder examsThe aftermath of Brexit and the difficulty of new GCSE and A-level exams have combined to put off young people from studying modern foreign languages (MFL) at school, according to a new report by the British Council.While more than two-thirds of teachers surveyed by the British Council said the difficulty of the exams was causing concern, one in four said Brexit had “cast a pall” over pupils learning any foreign languages, with some parents actively discouraging their children.Teachers told researchers that they have seen a shift in attitudes since the Brexit referendum, with one reporting: “We have had parents mention that they do not believe their son or daughter should be studying a language as it is little to no use to them now that we are leaving the European Union.”Another teacher noted comments from pupils, “obviously heard at home, such as now we’ve leftare leaving the EU you won’t need this any more”.The annual report by the British Council on trends in language teaching in England also found a decline in schools taking part in cross-border activities including student exchanges or overseas trips, with schools blaming funding pressures, Brexit uncertainty and safeguarding concerns.School leaders warned that the country was in danger of becoming monolinguistic, with the report finding that children from disadvantaged families and pupils with lower academic results were much less likely to take up languages than their better-off classmates.Vicky Gough, the schools adviser at the British Council, said: “Everyone should have the chance to learn a language but teachers report that many pupils – particularly the most disadvantaged – are being put off by the difficulty of exams and a sense that languages just aren’t for them.“Coupled with a decline in the international experiences offered at primary and secondary schools, these findings paint an alarming picture.”One teacher told the British Council: “New GCSE is too demanding for lower attaining pupils. They are dissuaded as it is too challenging - even at foundation - and not seen as relevant for them.”Teresa Tinsley, the report’s lead researcher, said the results suggested that language learning in England’s schools was becoming increasingly segregated along socio-economic and academic lines.“Pupils from poorer backgrounds and those who are less academically inclined are much less likely than their peers to acquire any substantial language skills or access foreign cultures in any significant way, challenges that Brexit looks to exacerbate,” she said.“We all know the pressures schools are under, but these inequalities are not good for our society or the future of our country.”Teachers have long complained about the perceived difficulty of gaining high marks in modern foreign languages, especially at A-level, with concerns that results are skewed by the current grading system putting non-native speakers at a disadvantage.The report found that “very few” state secondary schools allowed pupils to study a language other than French, German or Spanish. In state primary schools, language teaching is often “ad hoc and minimal,” it said. “Languages are often seen as lower priority than other subjects and may be pushed out of the timetable, for example during Sats exams in year six,” it noted.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We are in danger of becoming a monolinguistic country unless we do something to rejuvenate the love and learning of languages.“Schools are also struggling with a severe shortage of language teachers and Brexit could worsen this situation because many of our language teachers come from EU countries.”Ofqual, the exams regulator for England, said it was already conducting a review of grading in GCSE French, German and Spanish. “We take seriously concerns about the perceived difficulty of MFL subjects and continue to look at this issue in detail,” a spokesperson said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5efd1137f9d40754484722f2eeb6694a6e20fb64/0_205_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f0155d65a059e48737225357336a8a0","title":"head of top catholic school stands down after damning report","story":"Inspection found Ampleforth college was failing to meet child protection standards England’s most prestigious Catholic school, Ampleforth college, is facing a new leadership crisis after an inspection found it was failing to meet child protection standards.The college confirmed its acting head, Deirdre Rowe, was stepping down after just 10 months in the job, and an interim head would be appointed.The move follows an unannounced inspection to monitor progress, carried out in May at the request of the Department for Education. According to a report in Catholic journal the Tablet, the highly critical inspection report found the school did not meet standards for safeguarding, leadership, behaviour, combating bullying and complaints handling.The north Yorkshire college was founded more than 200 years ago by Benedictine monks at Ampleforth Abbey. Its former pupils include Julian Fellowes, the Conservative peer and creator of Downton Abbey, the actor Rupert Everett and the sculptor Antony Gormley. Its fees are more than £35,000 a year for senior boarders.Rowe was appointed as acting head last August after five years in charge of safeguarding at the college. She will hand over to a new interim head, before a permanent head is appointed later this year.A spokesperson for Ampleforth College said: “We have recognised that a small number of incidents, where our robust policies have not been followed, have led to the judgment from the inspectors that we have not yet met all of the required standards. Each incident has been, or is being, investigated and addressed with the authorities and the students and parents involved.“Given the investment that has been made in our academic curriculum, governance and staff training, we know our school deserves world-class leadership. As a result, we aim shortly to appoint an interim head, to begin in post by September 2019, and we have advised the DfE of this plan. They will bring considerable change management and safeguarding expertise to the role, before we make an announcement on the appointment of a permanent head by the end of the year.”The leadership changes mean that, by the end of 2019, the college will have had four heads in just over a year, according to the Tablet.Last August, the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse published a highly critical 211-page report on Ampleforth and another Catholic school, Downside in Somerset.Ampleforth Abbey has been managed by a lawyer appointed by the Charity Commission since April 2018 after its abbot, Cuthbert Madden, was removed from post following allegations that he indecently assaulted pupils.

As it stands the story we are telling is incomplete,” the report said.The report called on the government to carry out research to find out exactly what was being taught in schools, and it said teachers, who may avoid topics they feel are controversial, needed more support and training.The Department for Education said it fundamentally disagreed with “the narrow scope” of the report. “The topic of migration and the British empire are compulsory in several parts of the history and English curriculum for both primary and secondary school,” a spokesperson said.“Our compulsory citizenship curriculum also teaches students about the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, which is historically linked to the British empire and its erse, national, regional, ethnic and erse identities.”Kimberly McIntosh, Runnymede’s senior policy officer and one of the report’s authors, said: “The influence of migration and empire both to our history and to the richness of British culture is unmistakable. Yet whether students get taught this vital part of our national story is a lottery.“A lack of understanding of migration and empire has consequences for contemporary Britain. Last year’s Windrush scandal laid bare the shocking lack of understanding successive governments had about the ‘winding up’ of the empire – with lives ruined as a result.“As we grapple with our post-Brexit future, a realistic appraisal of our past and present relationships with the wider world, as well as migration and empire, has never been more urgent.”For schools, however, there are already huge pressures on timetables. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The teaching of migration is clearly an important part of learning about the society in which we live, and is already referenced in various parts of the curriculum.“But there are only so many hours in the school day and making subjects mandatory means something else has to be taken out of the timetable. There is enormous pressure on school timetables, and school leaders are best placed to make decisions about how best to balance the competing demands.”The historian and broadcaster David Olusoga said: “It is the story of the empire that makes sense of the Britain we live in today. If you skip over that history what you lose are the backstories of millions of British people whose ancestors came from Africa, Asia and the West Indies.“I find it hard to believe that the Windrush scandal could have been possible if we were a country that was aware of and educated in the history of empire, decolonisation and migration after 1945.”Dawn Butler, who is the shadow women and equalities secretary, will chair a panel discussion on the subject in parliament on Thursday. The Labour MP said: “This report contains some important recommendations and I strongly support all efforts to educate our young people on how migration and empire have shaped Britain. Currently, children only study a small section of history and it is often a biased perspective.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3e977d0218b1c143c21c6a1f07ca5bd177e2962/0_243_2592_1555/master/2592.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa223908b947ece2f2accecac191ad78","title":"deep sea mining to turn oceans into new industrial frontier","story":"Greenpeace report reveals 29 floor-exploration licences have been granted worldwideThe world’s oceans are facing a “new industrial frontier” from a fledgling deep-sea mining industry as companies line up to extract metals and minerals from some of the most important ecosystems on the planet, a report has found.The study by Greenpeace revealed that although no mining had started on the ocean floor, 29 exploration licences had been issued covering an area five times bigger than the UK. Environmentalists said the proposed mining would threaten not only crucial ecosystems but the global fight against climate breakdown.Louisa Casson, an ocean campaigner at Greenpeace, said: “The health of our oceans is closely linked to our own survival. Unless we act now to protect them, deep-sea mining could have devastating consequences for marine life and humankind.”The licences, issued by a United Nations body, the International Seabed Authority, have been granted to a handful of countries that sponsor private companies. They cover vast areas of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, totalling 1.3m sq km (500,000 sq miles).If the mining goes ahead, large machines will be lowered on to the seabed to excavate cobalt and other rare metals.Campaigners said that, as well as destroying little understood regions of the ocean floor, the operations would deepen the climate emergency by disrupting carbon stores in seafloor sediments, reducing the ocean’s ability to store it.The industry has said deep-sea mining is essential to extract the materials needed for a transition to a green economy by supplying raw materials for key technologies including batteries, computers and phones. Its advocates say deep-sea mining is less harmful to the environment and workers than most existing mineral and mining operations.However, the report said: “The deep-sea mining industry presents its development as essential for a low-carbon future, yet this claim is not substantiated by actors in the renewable energy, electric vehicle or battery sectors. Such arguments ignore calls for a move from the endless exploitation of resources to a transformational and circular economy.”The environmentalist Chris Packham, writing in the , said deep-sea mining posed a serious threat to global oceans.“We’ve already seen the huge destruction ravaged upon our planet by corporations mining on land. Are we really prepared to give the go-ahead to the mining industry expanding into a new frontier, where it will be even harder for us to scrutinise the damage caused?”The report called on governments to agree on a strong global ocean treaty in the next 12 months, citing scientists, governments, environmentalists and representatives of the fishing industry, who warned of the threat posed by deep-sea mining to marine life.The report said the UK government held licences to exploit more of the international seabed than any government apart from China. It accused ministers of positioning the government as a leader on marine protection while simultaneously investing in deep-sea mining.Casson said: “We need the UK government to show strong global leadership and champion ocean protection. They have backed the call for global action to safeguard our oceans but they are also a leading advocate for deep-sea mining. Such hypocrisy is unacceptable.”A government spokesperson said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction. We have sponsored two exploration licences, which allows scientific marine research to fully understand the effects of deep sea mining and we will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031a767a117d6b264da5c7c854616ce2dccbffcd/0_0_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aea9d1b980899dd8e1f71b74fd161b9e","title":"ten common myths about bike lanes and why theyre wrong","story":"From congestion to cost, there are many entirely misguided arguments in circulationCycle lanes have been in the news recently, as have the many often entirely misguided arguments that opponents use against them.For all the (slight) progress in some UK cities over mass cycling, we are still at a stage where a leaflet from a local branch of the party of government (see below) will state falsehoods about bike lanes as if they were the undoubted truth.So perhaps it’s time to demolish 10 of the most common myths about cycle infrastructure. Do by all means suggest more in the comments below.This is perhaps the most common myth, possibly because critics confuse what feels like it’s true with what actually is true: the assumption that if you take some road space from motor vehicles, you get more traffic jams – as with (a commonly used parallel) forcing water down a smaller pipe.But fluid and traffic are not the same thing, as shown by 60 years of governments trying and failing to road-build their way out of congestion. The idea of induced demand – more road space brings more cars – has been known for decades, and it also works in reverse. This is especially so with bike lanes, which are such an efficient use of the same space that they can often mean the same amount of space carrying more people overall.Yes, traffic jams have worsened in some cities where bike lanes have been built, but studies show this is largely down to other factors, for example the growth in the number of Uber-type private hire vehicles and Amazon delivery vans.Most compelling of all, of course, is the fact that motor vehicles cause the congestion in the first place, and the only real way to reduce traffic congestion is to have fewer of them on the roads.It seems that on Twitter you’re never more than 10 minutes away from seeing a bike lane critic post a photo of an empty cycle route with the triumphant message: “See?!” Often this is just a cunningly timed picture, but other factors are at play, not least the efficiency of cycle lanes, which means any “traffic” tends to rapidly bunch up at red lights.Around the world, in just about every city where proper cycle routes have been built, many more riders start using them. One classic example is Seville in southern Spain, where the recent construction of 50 miles of bike lanes led to an 11-fold increase in rider numbers.The myth-busting here comes in two parts: first, it’s not as true as some argue, and second, where it is an issue, this is a sign that you need more safe cycling routes, not fewer.But yes, poorer people and those from minority ethnic backgrounds do ride bikes. Transport for London statistics show the ethnic mix of the city’s cyclists roughly matches that of the population. In the US, the group most like to cycle (or walk) to work are those from households with incomes of less than $10,000 (£7,930) a year – ie the very poor.The other thing to stress is that the more obviously safe the cycling in your town or city, the more erse and mixed the people on bikes. Without proper infrastructure, cycling becomes something of a specialist pursuit, mainly restricted to what you might call the hobbyists – people with the more expensive bike, the greater confidence and the willingness to mix it with motor traffic.The converse is seen in places such as the Netherlands and Denmark: while “cyclists” – people who have a drawerful of Lycra and an interest in gear ratios – do exist, they’re a different breed from the mass of everyday transport riders, who in socioeconomic terms encompass more or less everyone from royalty downwards.A series of barely connected bike lanes, such as in London, might be fine for commuters but people who make more varied journeys – for example those (disproportionately women) who need to go to work via a school and back via a shop – require a coherent network, including the other half of the safe-cycling equation, tamed backstreets, where cars are reduced in number and travel at slow speeds.Some of the noisiest opponents of recent London bike lanes have been inidual business owners, who argue that a separated bike lane and any loss of parking will be fatal to their enterprise.In broad terms, however, this is completely wrong. Towns, cities and inidual high streets are changing in how they compete. The growth of internet shopping means they must appeal more as destinations, which is hard to do amid wall-to-wall traffic.Studies have shown that shop owners tend to overestimate the proportion of customers who arrive by car, and that consumers on bikes often purchase more in the long term.Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the real-world impact of cycle lanes, undertaken in New York City, found businesses on streets with separated bike routes grew on average more quickly than those without. In contrast, I know of no evidence that points the other way.A surprisingly common charge – surprising in that it has absolutely no basis in logic, let alone reality. Sure, some elements of cycle lane design might seem new to Britons – for example, “floating” bus stops where passengers cross a cycle lane to reach them – but when they’re designed well there is no evidence they cause danger.More basically, there’s no getting away from the fact that motor vehicles are much, much, much more dangerous. On average each year in the UK between zero and two pedestrians die after being hit by bikes. About 400 a year die after being hit by motor vehicles, including more than 60 struck while on the pavement.As cannot be repeated enough, this is not about cyclists being somehow morally pure. It’s just physics. It’s possible to kill or maim someone if you are a 100kg-ish bike-and-human combination travelling at 12mph, but is extremely unlikely. In a 1.5-tonne SUV at 35mph, it is hideously easy.This is such a silly idea it’s baffling that it still needs regular debunking. People break road laws, on all forms of road transport, and if anything they do so more often on average in motor vehicles.See also: “My 85-year-old granny has two plastic hips and walks with a Zimmer frame – how do you expect her to ride everywhere?”The most tempting response to this is a deep sigh: no one to my knowledge has suggested that if you build safe cycling routes, that will be the only form of transport on offer, let alone compulsory. And while there’s a wider case for removing private cars from urban areas, even if you build cycling infrastructure then roads and cars – as well as buses – will still exist. They will also move more freely for those who really need them.Regarding heavy loads: again, no one says all road freight must vanish. But it’s also worth noting that cargo bikes or trailers, especially with electric-assist, can carry heavy loads – even that hypothetical fridge. Some tradespeople, even supermarkets, already use cargo bikes, particularly in big cities where distances are shorter and parking scarce. More widely there is huge potential scope for “last mile” deliveries, especially of Amazon-size packages, to be moved from vans to cargo bikes.The slightly trite riposte is that at one point even the Netherlands was not the Netherlands. In the early 1970s the Dutch had some of the worst cycling casualty rates in the world, as roads used for decades by cyclists were filled with more and more cars. This prompted a mass protest movement, the result of which was 40-plus years of building safe infrastructure. Ultimately, it’s about political will.See also: “But the NetherlandsDenmark are flat.” Yes, they are, though a classic Dutch headwind can feel like riding up a steep incline. But this is also by no means a deal breaker, especially in the e-bike era. Bristol, for example, has relatively high rates of cycling for the UK, and it’s not exactly flat.See also: “Ah, but LondonEdinburghyou name it are old cities with narrow streets.” This is perhaps the most desperate plea of the lot. It’s not as if Amsterdam or Copenhagen are Milton Keynes.Amazingly, this does get said, often accompanied by the curiously enduring myth that cyclists “don’t pay for the roads”.As Chris Boardman, the cycle campaigner turned cycle tsar for Greater Manchester, noted last month, his planned revamp of the region would cost £1.5bn and would deliver 1,800 miles of safer cycling. That might sound a lot, he said, until you remember that the government has agreed to spend £1.4bn improving a single roundabout in Bedfordshire. So yes, by transport standards, cycling is an absolute bargain.This is, in effect, the message of the critics: not this, not now – let’s try to get away with unambitious schemes without proper infrastructure, which will never change much.You could write a whole column – even a book – about why this is absurd, but it’s always worth stressing this point to the cycling naysayers: OK, what’s your solution to gridlock, pollution, a climate emergency to cities that are noisy, dangerous and unjust? They will not respond, because there is no answer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d51d06cc64fd0968d74b02200ee2e7d5c98967d/308_989_2442_1464/master/2442.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c447814b5056e33a1c0529fb99fa9fe","title":"curated ear why delicate decorative piercings are the new tattoos","story":"Multiple piercings make a strong fashion statement, and are less of a commitment than getting inked. But do you know your antitragus from your conch?Conch, rook, helix, daith: these words won’t mean anything to most people, but to an army of voguish women, they are immediately recognisable as the parts of the ear that can be pierced. Look around boutique gyms, co-working spaces for the creative industries and stylish bars, and you will see women – mostly in their 20s and 30s – with intricately pierced ears.So what is the appeal? “There was a good portion of my life where I was dunking my ears in salt water for most of an evening,” says Caitlin Quinlan, a 23-year-old who works in the film industry. She has 10 piercings across both of her ears, all in gold. “I get a few compliments on my ears, and I always really like it, because I feel like I’ve achieved something – I’ve curated my ears, and it’s nice that people notice it.”Another ear-piercing fan says: “I think I just need the rush every six months of having a stranger stab me with something very sharp in a safe and controlled environment.” Humans have been piercing their ears for thousands of years – bronze age frescoes depicting women wearing hoop earrings can be found on the Greek island of Santorini – but the craze for multiple piercings, often using fine metals and precious stones, is a more modern phenomenon. One of its early proponents was Maria Tash, an American jeweller and piercer to the stars. Living in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the early 90s, she watched body piercings became fashionable. Piercers would typically use titanium jewellery with little adornment, but Tash would customise her piercings by popping a rose gold bead into a plain ring, or anodising wire into different colours. She opened her first boutique in New York in 2004 since then, she has created a global piercing empire. In addition to two London outposts, Tash has studios in Rome, Dublin and Dubai, and her celebrity fans including Rihanna and Zoë Kravitz (Rihanna has worn a diamond stud in her helix, and a ring in her third lobe Kravitz has her tragus pierced, as well as other body parts).A Maria Tash ear does not come cheap: prices range from £42 for a simple gold threaded stud, to £5,890 for a pear-shaped diamond. As they are designed to be “stacked” in an ear, getting the look can run to thousands of pounds.“The curated ear is my philosophy of how we enhance a client’s beauty through layering jewellery on the ear,” says Tash. “We look very closely at the anatomy, skin tone … any scars or asymmetric features.”The most popular trends Tash is encountering include a “stacked lobe”, with ear piercings that go above and are parallel to first and second lobe piercings, and a “high conch” piercing, in the upper, flat part of the ear. Walking the streets of Manhattan, Tash sees her influence in many passing ears.“My eyes gravitate to things,” she says. “I think: ‘Oh, that’s a crappy placement, or that’s beautiful, or that’s my stone.’ It’s great.”Tash isn’t the only big-name piercer in the game. In much the same way that tattoo artists have become celebrities in their own right, some of the most celebrated piercers have huge social media followings, and lengthy waiting lists. Ben Tauber, for example, has more than 56,000 Instagram followers, while J Colby Smith is known for piercing the fashion and media glitterati in Brooklyn and Los Angeles.At least part of the popularity of multiple ear piercings may be down to the fact that they are a low-effort, reversible alternative to tattoos. Like inking, curated ears are seen as subversive, but they can also be worn every day. And they are a form of body modification that appeals to those wary of making long-term commitments. “The thing that has always been powerful about piercing is that you can take it out and you can change it as your mood dictates,” says Tash. And it is less of an undertaking, as Lucy Halligan, a 21-year-old PA from London, says. She adds that she got her 15 ear piercings “because I was too scared to get a tattoo”.Social media has also accelerated the trend. Browse the hashtag “curated ear” on Instagram and you will see thousands of posts. Brands such as By Nouck and J\u0026ampCo Jewellery use the platform as their predominant means of marketing. “Customers use platforms such as Instagram to inspire a whole new look for their ear,” says Williams, who adds that daith (a hoop of skin in the inner ear) and helix piercings are very popular now. Another reason why the curated ear may be so popular is because it is low-effort but also chic. Once you have forked out for the jewellery – and endured the twice-daily saline soaks needed for your piercings to heal – you are set. You don’t have to change your earrings, or match them to your outfit as you might with single lobe piercings.But the mania for piercings isn’t risk-free. After Halligan got her rook pierced in February, it got infected. “There’s no pain that can describe your cartilage swelling,” she says, grimacing. Halligan spent three days in hospital on an antibiotic drip. While there, hospital staff removed all her other piercings.“I could hear all of the little barbells dropping into a pot. I kept thinking: ‘That’s 20 quid.’ I was so upset.” Had Halligan not sought medical help, however, the infection could have spread to her brain.For now, it looks likely that the piercing trend isn’t going away. And, despite everything, Halligan would consider getting more piercings. She says there is a woman at her work who has her conch pierced, and Halligan finds herself looking at it enviously. “It looks so nice. Every time I say it, everyone’s like: ‘Not this again.’”  This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Together, they celebrate him as both a visionary, and a scammer.I wonder if the world would consider this self-professed “humbug” light, innocuous entertainment if they knew he sent henchmen to the colonies to kidnap and coerce Aboriginal men, women and children, before casting them as “human oddities” in Barnum \u0026amp Bailey’s “show-stopping” exhibition The Ethnological Congress of Strange Tribes?In truth, Barnum tore apart families, denying them the ability to practice their culture, all the while exploiting the western world’s voyeuristic curiosity about the colonies.Many Aboriginal people who were kidnapped or lured to join Barnum’s circus understood this to be their new lot in life, and some even embraced it as a vehicle to lead a new secret existence away from the missions.To escape the Aboriginal Protection Board, which governed where Aboriginal people could live or work and quarantined all their wages, many performers hid their identity to get ahead. Several “Spanish” or “wild Indian” performers went on to become some of the greatest circus acts in the world. When tightrope walker Con Colleano, one of the highest paid vaudeville performers ever, died in Miami in 1973, not one Australian newspaper mentioned him. Yet across the Americas he was widely celebrated as “the Wizard of the Wire”.Colleano possessed enormous skill no one has perfected a forward somersault on a highwire since. But he had to change his name and identity at huge personal sacrifice to achieve what he did.To learn that Con Colleano was an Aboriginal man from Lismore brings an enormous sense of pride and inspiration to First Nations communities, showing them that they too can excel against all odds. Colleano lived between two worlds, and has left us an incredible legacy – along with other notable Aboriginal circus performers.Consider too the story of Tambo. Tambo was kidnapped along with 17 Indigenous men, women and children from the Hinchenbrook and Palm Island communities, and became a “star” attraction of Barnham’s circus in the late 1800s. When he died, his remains were embalmed and exhibited in Drew’s Dime Museum. His wife and other members of his family were unable to perform the customary death rituals necessary for him to go off to The Dreaming. His remains were only repatriated to Palm Island in 1994, where the rightful ceremony was conducted.It’s important that stories like Tambo’s and Colleano’s are told. That’s why we are excited for Natives Go Wild, the Sydney Opera House’s new First Nations cabaret, which shines a light on the dark underbelly of Barnum \u0026amp Bailey.Fundamentally, the show is about resilience. It inverts the story of Barnham and his “Greatest Show” through song, dance, and, of course, humour, which is so often used to deal with intergenerational trauma in Aboriginal culture.But while humour has a long history in Aboriginal theatre, Indigenous productions these days can sometimes move into ‘“worthy” or serious territory. Yes, there was a moment in history when we needed those stories, but I think we’ve moved on from there – and I’ve been interested in the fun aspect of cabaret and vaudeville for a long time. We want to engage audiences in all facets of First Nations culture, not just the serious dance or theatre shows.It’s important to share a global First Nations story too – one that s the Pacific, as we’re all connected. While fewer Fijians were kidnapped (access to them was more limited), some Polynesian women were taken to join Barnum’s “Human Zoo” in London, alongside Asian, Aboriginal, Pacific Islander, African, Canadian and American performers. Within six months, almost half of them had died from pneumonia. When Barnum’s money spinning “Fijian Mermaid” passed away, he crudely grafted a monkey with a fish, which people travelled the world to marvel at. It’s still on display at Coney Island, although the monkey has now lost all its hair.For me, Natives Go Wild is about honouring the pain and resilience of First Nations people. We are incredibly adaptable. We can encounter the worst situations and wake up to tackle the next day with optimism and hope, to fulfil our inherited cultural legacy. The next generation of First Nations artists are sticking it to the establishment and having some fun in the process.• Natives Go Wild makes its world premiere at Sydney Opera House on 19 October 2019• Rhoda Roberts is the head of First Nations programming at Sydney Opera House"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e328f02de46911e66f545b340cf242f8ed190207/0_161_1430_858/master/1430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2623722792db0c3514c02d5343d1374e","title":"toy story 2 casting couch blooper deleted by disney after metoo movement","story":"Now removed scene features Stinky Pete behaving in an inappropriate way with Barbie dollsA fake blooper scene from Toy Story 2 featuring a “casting couch” scenario has been quietly deleted by Disney from the latest home releases of the animated film.A running gag in Pixar’s films are the faux outtakes that play alongside the closing credits, depicting the animated characters making mistakes, pulling pranks on each other, fudging their lines or speaking directly to camera as if they were real actors. The outtakes regularly make fun of Hollywood and the film industry more broadly.The now deleted scene from the 1999 film featured the character Stinky Pete the Prospector, a small, rotund, bearded toy, caught chatting salaciously to two Barbie dolls, stroking their hands and suggesting he could get them a part in the next movie.The scene reflects the practice within the entertainment industry of executives and men with power requesting or demanding sex acts from subordinates in exchange for career opportunities or promotion. The practice gained widespread condemnation after the #MeToo movement, particularly after the allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple women against film mogul Harvey Weinstein.The scene deletion was discovered last month by users in online forums and sites like reddit, and reported by the independent film site Rereleasenews. It reportedly affects both Blu-Ray and download versions.The deletion also comes after Pixar Animation Studios co-founder and Walt Disney Company animation chief John Lasseter permanently parted ways from Disney at the end of last year in the wake of the #MeToo movement, after allegations of misconduct and what he referred to as unspecified “missteps” in his behaviour towards colleagues.Lasseter, who directed Toy Story 2, said in a statement in November 2017 that it had been brought to his attention that he had made some colleagues “feel disrespected or uncomfortable”.“I especially want to apologise to anyone who has ever been on the receiving end of an unwanted hug or any other gesture they felt crossed the line in any way, shape, or form,” he said. “No matter how benign my intent, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and have them respected.”The Toy Story franchise has been one of Pixar and Disney’s most successful, in terms of both box office takings and critical acclaim. The first film in the series was released in 1995. Disney purchased Pixar Animation Studios in 2006.The most recent instalment of the series, Toy Story 4, was released in June. It was not without its own controversies, with Parks and Recreation star Rashida Jones quitting her writing role on the film, citing “philosophical differences” over a lack of ersity at Pixar.Disney has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00da6633319cb5f6615480e9b700750e60bcc354/0_187_1281_768/master/1281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25d57d4c45e27a28e4247eb9a5a47a4a","title":"alex morgan tea celebration usa england womens world cup","story":"US goal celebrations were a talking point yet again during Tuesday’s World Cup semi-final against England.

Mail us or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU“Is the Women’s World Cup the most penalty-ish tournament ever?” asks Thomas Levine. “Either in terms of percentage of goals? Or percentage of goals which impact on a result – which reduces the distorting effect of the Thailand thumping a bit.”Last week’s Knowledge archive section focused on players who have been involved in the most same-city derbies …Quite a few of you pointed out that Richard Gough should have two derbies revoked (Derby-Forest) and San José v Los Angeles Galaxy. “They’re more than 300 miles apart. That’s roughly the same as London to Cologne,” writes Chris Taylor. if we stick strictly to those rules then Paul Stewart loses two derbies (Sunderland-Newcastle and West Brom-Wolves), taking him back to four, while Christian Ziege loses one (Newcastle-Sunderland), moving him back to five.So, purely focusing on same-city derbies, Liam Patrick Corbett has a new leader in the category. “The Brazilian Ronaldo (who surely would have been the best of all time but for the injuries) played in the five below:”1) For Cruzeiro v Atletico Mineiro (City: Belo Horizonte)2) For Barcelona v Eyol 3) For Internazionale v Milan and for Milan v Internazionale4) For Real Madrid v Atlético Madrid5) For Corinthians v Palmeiras“That’s without counting El Clasíco (as non-same city). I also believe he scored in most of these too. I can’t find record of him playing in the Eindhoven derby v FC Eindhoven as they were in different leagues during his time in Holland so probably not unless they met in the cup.”“I surely can’t be the only one to point out this example from the ongoing Women’s World Cup. France’s captain is the wonderful Amandine Henry. Her club team is Lyon, which just so happens to be led out in matches by her fellow French international, the peerless Wendie Renard,” writes Aditya Narayanan.“Phil Stamp once popped the ball in a challenge during what I think was the 1998-99 season. Has any other footballer managed this feat?” wondered Paul Teigh in March 2006.“Ian Wright did it during one of the Arsenal v Manchester United league games in the 1996-97 season,” writes Chris McCluskey. “I’m not sure if it was the Highbury or Old Trafford game because Peter Schmeichel and Wright had bust-ups in both of them. Wright went flying in as Schmeichel was coming out to narrow the angle and his two-footed ‘first touch’ burst the ball against Peter’s shins. The momentum of the challenge also made Schmeichel do a comical break-dancing style spin.”But Mat Wood reckons he can top the BBC pundit’s achievement. “Being an ardent Minsterman I was at York City v Millwall in a match played at Bootham Crescent during the 1997-98 campaign,” he recalls. “I particularly remember this match as Nigel Pepper burst not one, but two footballs.

But the article warned that funders maintain a high degree of confidentiality and control over the results.In some instances, researchers who attempted to document negative findings had been subject to “personal and institutional pressure, intimidation and censorship”, the article said. The authors also warned of more subtle forms of bias, such as self-censorship on the part of academics and embellished findings.“It undermines learning,” said Katerini Storeng, associate professor at the Centre for Development and the Environment at the University of Oslo, and the lead author. “If we’re not forthright about the limitations of what is being implemented or the strategies that we’re pursuing it becomes difficult to learn anything.”She added that communities who are being served by health projects could also potentially suffer.A registry for global health evaluations, similar to the one promoting transparency in clinical trials, is among the article’s recommendations, which are endorsed by more than 200 researchers based in 40 different countries.“It is well known in clinical medicine that pharmaceutical industry-funded trials are more likely to produce positive, flattering results than independently funded trials,” the authors said. “It is time to debate this important issue in global health too.”Perverse incentives across the development sector encourage the use of “bad or fudged” data by agencies, it added. The article referred to previous warnings of a “success cartel” in global health, where pressure to achieve targets has led some governments and other development agencies to inflate their achievements.Cuts to research budgets in global health have left universities increasingly reliant on funding from government departments, private foundations and industry.The article says researchers often receive funding from donors , including the UK, US and French governments, as well as the international health body Unitaid, and the Bill \u0026amp Melinda Gates Foundation. Such bodies commission academics to evaluate programmes they are funding, the researchers warn, “even though they have a stake in results that demonstrate the success of a multibillion-dollar investment”.The researchers raised concern over rules imposed on them by the UK government’s Department for International Development (DfID), which state they must not embarrass the department, or bring it into disrepute.In a statement, DfID said the clause “does not have the intention or effect of gagging any party, nor of preventing whistleblowing, which would be unlawful, and it does not prevent criticism of DfID’s policy”.Donors, the editorial argued, should scrap such clauses and make it clear to NGO partners that they cannot interfere with the design, data collection analysis or sharing of findings. The recommendations also called on universities to refuse contracts that prevent researchers from sharing critical findings.Each study should also be overseen by an independent research oversight committee, which includes representatives from the communities that are being studied or civil society organisations, researchers added.The article was prompted by a recent paper in the Lancet, in which academics reported they had been subject to censorship when evaluating a maternal health project funded by the DfID – a claim the department denied.DfID said it was committed to supporting rigorous research: “DfID takes issues of research ethics, independence, quality and transparency seriously. We have procedures in place that we require projects and programmes we work with to adhere to.”It added that contract clauses are designed to protect DfID by ensuring that contractors adhere to “good working practices and do not engage in activities that bring DfID into disrepute”.A spokesperson for USAid said the agency had noted the editorial, adding: “USAid is committed to the pursuit of high-quality evaluative activities that support data-driven decision-making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c084576abb39ff6b11bdd694004cd469da9c4751/0_308_4796_2877/master/4796.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba09ee96fad9756f8ee3a5c4dc3fa50c","title":"london records biggest rise in cycling journeys in 2018","story":"Cycling campaigners welcomed the figures but cautioned previous studies had showed growth in distance travelled was not necessarily a sign of more people cycling, and said more needed to be done to encourage wider take-up.London’s walking and cycling commissioner, Will Norman, said: “The mayor is determined to enable more cycling all across the capital, and I’m really pleased last year saw the biggest increase in the amount of cycling in London since records began.”Norman added: “It is clear that where we have invested in new high-quality routes, people feel safer and more confident cycling on London’s streets. And it is yet more evidence for boroughs across London that investing in walking and cycling infrastructure works – getting more people healthy and active as part of their everyday routine, and making our streets cleaner, greener and safer.”Sam Jones, of Cycling UK, said: “The important thing is getting protected space and routes where people feel safe.”He added: “Any growth in cycling is a good thing, but we’re clearly a long way from when women, children and the elderly feel comfortable and safe enough to make those shorter local journeys – whether those are to the shops, school, education – all of which are needed not just to increase the ersity of people who are cycling but also the amount of people cycling.”Fran Graham, the campaigns coordinator of the London Cycling Campaign, said: “Time and time again, evidence shows that if you create the conditions that mean people feel safe cycling, they will. But the mayor has a way to go before London is known as a ‘byword for cycling’ – it’s why it is so important that he hits his target to triple protected cycle track by the end of his term.”She added: “Borough councils also have a large part to play – the recent actions of Kensington and Chelsea to oppose walking and cycling improvements are holding London back, stopping it from becoming a world-class cycling city.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54a08aa1437c3c8f50b8842c9a69ae6a4bce7df/0_676_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95223cfd6fafa7745ca90efaa5206fa5","title":"what children around the world eat in pictures","story":"Photographer Gregg Segal travelled the world to document children and the food they eat in a week.

The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck! Warm fuzzy comedy from the king of smooth: guess the animal pattern pants, guess the animal sound, and then the surreal banter with the BBC journalist! When she asks, “When are you going to start?” Jeff casually replies, “Well, I think I already have” to an uproarious, loving crowd. Thanks for an amazing memory Jeff! Gary McKillion, 43, BarnstapleThe IICON stage was absolutely incredible. Obviously I loved the music, but I couldn’t believe how amazing the stage design was. It looked like something out of a dystopian future: proper way to listen to electronic music. Zach, 25, BristolThe Killers absolutely smashed it! We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

An audience-shot clip of Asher, a British Sign Language interpreter, went viral, showing her gunfinger-happy, head-spinningly dextrous visualisation of the grime MC’s rapidfire lyrics.For Asher, who also interpreted Stormzy at Glastonbury in 2017, it was just another night’s work. “There’s not many interpreters who interpret music and do festivals,” she says. “There’s a shortage nationally.” And there’s even fewer who specialise in grime. “I’ve listened to grime since the Risky Roadz days, since the very beginning, so it’s easier for me, because I understand the context, the slang, all that stuff.”Alongside Asher, Stormzy’s set was also interpreted by Stephanie Raper. Overall, 20 interpreters volunteer their time with Glastonbury’s DeafZone to make sure that key Glastonbury performances are accessible for deaf audiences. With each song taking about a day’s preparation to learn, it’s a mammoth job – made even more difficult by the fact that interpreters don’t have access to setlists before shows. This means they usually look up an artist’s recent sets online, and spend weeks prepping all the songs that might be played. And if the artist goes off-script and plays something new? “We just have to go with it,” says Raper. “It’s about the beat, the words, the melodies, the feeling, the tempo change – it’s just trying your best to relay all that.”For most interpreters, the work begins with immersing themselves in an artist’s world. Paula Cox, who interpreted Janet Jackson’s set, explains that ahead of a gig, she “listens constantly – in the car, in the morning, in the evening, when I’m cooking my dinner. Part of the research is looking on YouTube, and seeing how the artist moves to this song, and what their mood is. If they’ve got a certain way they hold themselves, you want to try and match that.”For Benjamin Gorman, who interpreted his very first set at Glastonbury for Bastille, preparation is more intricate. Gorman is deaf himself and performed with the support of other volunteers giving visual cues. “I had to read as many lyrics as I possibly could,” he explains. “Also, when you sign in BSL, it’s not the same grammar and structure as spoken English, so you need to think about how to change it, but not change it so much that you depart from the original lyrics.”Part of what makes such translations consistently go viral is the sheer emotive power of the performances, stemming from the visually expressive nature of the language. Angela Dawes – who provided BSL interpretation for Christine and the Queens, Billie Eilish, and Loyle Carner – finds it easier to translate when she connects emotionally with a song. “Having an artist you can relate to – that really helps. We want to put that across in our interpretation: how you feel when you listen to a song.”As well as covering main performances, DeafZone also provide “roaming” interpreters who support deaf people accessing other aspects of Glastonbury, such as getting a massage or watching a debate. But DeafZone’s work isn’t only about helping deaf people – it’s also about raising awareness of BSL as a language in the hearing community. Volunteer Abigail Gorman (who is deaf herself) explains that the DeafZone tent provides free BSL classes to all Glastonbury-goers. “We talk about deaf history, culture, language. We don’t want people to just come in and learn a few signs – that’s tokenistic. We want people in the future to campaign on our behalf, be our allies and support us.”The best outcome of these viral videos would be more support for interpreters at festivals – who could benefit from access to setlists and an in-ear audio feed – but also, most importantly, improved access for the deaf festival-goers. The impact of that access can be immeasurable. “The first time I came to Glastonbury, I was a punter, and I didn’t expect anything,” says Gorman. “I’d been to other festivals with limited access – whereas here, it’s inclusive. I’m not ostracised. Festivals need to be more deaf aware. They need to employ deaf people to find out what deaf people need. I face a lot of barriers. There are no barriers here at Glastonbury.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe151c143b4f0e745784f08c0f53cd80fdb95b1/0_0_3016_2004/master/3016.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=411a976866b979bd7ec024846f6f6bc0 1400w","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts. I can’t tell them how to stitch the shoe. I have no idea how to stitch it.

Much longer. With the Conservative leadership hustings into their second week, the feeling of existential despair now feels total. What novelty there might once have been has long since worn off. Even Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson can barely keep their eyes open as they stumble their way through tired scripts. There is no sense of edge or danger. Of the next prime minister being tested. Just a continuing beauty parade of the incompetent and the inadequate. Lip service to democracy.There was barely a ripple of applause for the arrival of Hunt in Belfast. Not just because there wasn’t much interest in Ken doll – there was no greater enthusiasm for the appearance of Johnson later – but also because there are only 500 Tory members in Northern Ireland and most of them had better things to do with their life than turn up for something entirely meaningless. The others had merely come for the tea and biscuits.Overnight, Hunt seemed to have forgotten his 10-point Colonel Kurtz no-deal action plan and drifted back into his more familiar role of Barbie’s squeeze. His stump speech was delivered with all the passion of a man on heavy medication. Halfway through, he seemed to vaguely remember he was in Northern Ireland and dropped in a reference to Game of Thrones. Which is the one thing about Northern Ireland that people who don’t give a toss about Northern Ireland actually know.The MC for the day, the radio presenter Iain Dale, briefly woke up to point out that even by the standards of this leadership contest, this was a lie too far. “Hmm,” Ken grumbled. It was typical of the EU to deny that something that didn’t exist actually didn’t exist. Clearly bored, Dale then asked Hunt which Game of Thrones character he most identified with. “I know it’s a cliche,” Ken smiled coyly. “But it’s Jon Snow.” Because that was the only character he could name. So he probably had no idea he had chosen the one who ends up in exile after killing the blonde psychopath who was about to destroy the world. The chronicle of a death foretold.Audience questions quickly petered out as Ken promised to spend billions of pounds he didn’t have on problems he didn’t understand, and though he didn’t want a no-deal Brexit, he’d do it anyway – just for the hell of it – if Johnny Foreigner didn’t appreciate his entrepreneurial skills. By the end, everyone had given up and had taken to asking him about his favourite colour and whether he preferred dogs to cats. Just to fill time.Still, at least Ken had some idea of where he was. Which was more than could be said for Johnson, who gave one of his laziest performances yet. There’s a fine line between being utterly bland to avoid screwing up and not appearing to give a shit. And Boris was well the wrong side of it. Good evening, Glasgow!When asked to explain the continuing failure of the power-sharing executive in Stormont, he made Karen Bradley seem like Mo Mowlam. When asked to talk about Game of Thrones, he burbled on about Star Wars. Which had been filmed in the Republic of Ireland. It was almost as if he was going out of his way to cause offence. Yes, he’d happily turn parts of Northern Ireland into a tax-free centre for smuggling. Though he couldn’t say what ports might qualify. And he’d build the bridge between Scotland and Ireland that every civil engineer said was impossible to build. There was no detail over which he had the slightest grasp. No wonder he struggles to remember how many children he has.Piffle, paffle, wiffle, waffle, Johnson ad-libbed. Everyone just ought to stop being so glum. A no-deal Brexit was nothing to be worried about. The negative claims being made were being wildly overdone. Just believe. By now, Boris had lost the entire room, as everyone had tuned into Philip Hammond’s final outing as chancellor at Treasury questions. Freewheelin’ Phil had been determined to go down fighting. Ken and Boris were complete fantasists, he shrugged. A no-deal departure would cost £95bn minimum. Money we didn’t have. And he’d happily vote with Labour to prevent them from bankrupting the country.Johnson was still rambling when Dale cut him short. “Let’s wrap this thing up,” he said. Enough was enough. Best to end the embarrassment. Would the last Tory left in Northern Ireland please turn out the lights?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83746c50e67be255f9ccc649988edcc597f49f1e/0_220_4470_2682/master/4470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e76066726f9d7557d90b2f9c4f151e4b","title":"total solar eclipse thousands in chile and argentina marvel at something supreme","story":"Best views were in the Atacama desert, where a total eclipse has not occurred since 1592 • Thousands watch total solar eclipse from Chile and Argentina – in picturesHundreds of thousands of tourists scattered across the north Chilean desert on Tuesday to experience a rare and irresistible combination for astronomy buffs: a total eclipse of the sun viewed from beneath the world’s clearest skies.A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the Earth and the sun, plunging the planet into darkness. It happens only rarely in any given spot across the globe.The best views this time were from Chile’s sprawling Atacama desert north of the coastal city of La Serena, where a lack of humidity and city lights combine to create the world’s clearest skies.The region had not seen an eclipse since 1592, according to the Chilean Astronomy Society. The next one is expected in 2165.La Serena, a city of some 200,000 people, saw the arrival of more than 300,000 visitors, forcing the local water company to increase output and service gas stations to store extra fuel. Police and health services were also reinforced.Office workers poured from buildings late in the afternoon to catch a glimpse of the phenomenon and a run on special “eclipse-viewing” glasses downtown had led to a shortage in many stores, with street vendors charging as much as $10 for a pair of the disposable, cardboard-framed lenses.Northern Chile is known for clear skies and some of the largest, most powerful telescopes on Earth are being built in the area, turning the South American country into a global astronomy hub.“In the past 50 years we’ve only had two eclipses going over observatories. So when it happens and an observatory lies in the path of a totality, it really is special for us,” said Elyar Sedaghati, an astronomer working as a fellow at the European Southern Observatory in Paranal, Chile.“We can finally use our toys during the day because it’s always at night that we use them.”The town of La Higuera was also plunged into total darkness.Town officials distributed more than 2,000 cardboard-frame protective eyeglasses at local schools and community centres while workers built statues of huge sunglasses and a darkened sun on a local square.The total eclipse could also be seen in the Argentine town of Chascomús, where dozens braved near-freezing temperatures and strong winds and claimed a spot at a pier in a lagoon, hoping to catch a glimpse of the eclipse.“I’ve been looking at the sky since my youth. My first telescope when I was a kid was made out of cardboard,” said Ricardo Rumie, a 68-year-old veteran eclipse-watcher, who set up his camera with a tripod and a telescope with a sun filter along the banks of the lagoon.“I’ve seen other eclipses but never like this one. I just couldn’t miss it. For me it’s something supreme.”“This is something that they say won’t repeat itself for like 300 years, so we wanted to bring our son,” said Maximiliano Giannobile, who arrived at the pier with 18-month-old Vitto wrapped in a puffy jacket and several layers of clothes.The Earth’s next total solar eclipse will be 14 December, 2020, and it also will cross Chile and Argentina, though on a different path."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/231487590dfb74ebcdde0f410877b349abd74bc6/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c5e5a84a073ea9f8bf206d926f851750 1320w","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

That’s the first thing that hits you, 4,500 people working on it, and only 176 of those are riding. There is no other bike race that even comes close to this scale. Yes, there are two other Grand Tours, the Giro d’Italia and the Vuelta a España, yet they are family affairs in comparison.The nature of the course doesn’t vary massively: it’s approximately 3,500km long, made up of 21 stages, mixing from flat transitional days to battles of epic proportions over some of the highest mountain passes in Europe. The rider with the least accumulated time over the 21 stages wins the overall and the coveted yellow jersey, of course, but winning only one of those stages can be career defining.The yellow jersey, or maillot jaune, wasn’t always around. This year is the 100th anniversary of its introduction, and the race itself is 116 years old. The history of the jersey itself is fascinating: a masterpiece in marketing by the Tour’s creator, the newspaper L’Auto, which was printed on yellow paper. Here was a leading motoring publication tapping into cycling, the new big thing. Henri Desgrange, the editor, understood that by creating its own race it had exclusivity, and by making it a three-week race – and inhumanely difficult – it could create the most interesting narratives. Think of Big Brother, or Love Island, for newspapers.The public lapped it up, circulation increased more than sixfold, the participants went from unknown eccentrics to national stardom, and the greatest bike race in the world was born.It is this very nature of how and why the race was created that explains why it has become so important. It was never truly about the final results – this isn’t an event where winning is everything – but about the human condition. Failure is often celebrated as much as success. Making it to Paris is for every rider, from the maillot jaune to the lanterne rouge in last, an emotional experience, and one that transcends racing.This is what riding the Tour de France is truly about for me. It’s about becoming part of the history of our sport. There are so many stories, myths and legends that surround and engulf it, from glorious heights to the deepest depths of darkness, and being part of it means you have earned the right to find your role.It is this history that sets the Tour apart and what makes it so special. For me it was only ever about the history, and this is what I fell in love with when I was a kid growing up in Hong Kong. .As a rider I was never stressed by the circus nature of the race – in fact that’s what I loved most – and the noise made it easier for me to focus on what it was.Most of the other races were dull in comparison because they didn’t have the depth and didn’t mean as much because they didn’t have as much history. In France the fans don’t go to watch the Tour de France riders, they go to watch the Tour de France event.This year we will see a changing of the guard. Chris Froome looked on track to equal the greatest Tour racers’ record of five overall wins but his horrific crash on a recce ride at the Critérium du Dauphiné last week put him out. I have no doubt he will be back for 2020.So it falls to Geraint Thomas to defend the title he won in a magisterial manner last year. Although he also crashed out of his final preparatory race he did not suffer injuries that could qualify as affecting his chances. Team Ineos will be the team to beat. They know how to do it better than anybody with six overall wins in the past seven editions in the colours of Team Sky and, remarkably, with three different riders.Yet, in all honesty, who wins doesn’t really matter. The Tour de France is bigger than any inidual, it’s become a cultural phenomenon, a Proustian memory of summer for the majority of the French population, omnipresent in the background of their whole lives, memories of carefree childhood Julys and shared timelines.It’s often referred to as the Circus, and maybe that’s the best way to think of it: the greatest show of them all.David Millar is a former Tour de France rider and partner in the CHPT3 bikes and clothing range"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78faa76ae038061ab81d231db073d0d575dfc587/0_359_3785_2271/master/3785.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=180f33ac8d79bf1afc359b33c79a63f7","title":"england new zealand cricket world cup 2019 live","story":"2nd over: England 15-0 (Roy 11, Bairstow 0) This, as Athers says on Sky, is a key phase of the game. England struggle against left-armers and Trent Boult is a world-class swing bowler. His first ball curves back into the pads of Roy, who survives a biggish LBW appeal. Although it was missing leg stump, that’s a really encouraging start for Boult. With the ball swinging, Roy starts respectfully against Boult, but he is alert enough to put a poor delivery through midwicket for four. He has faced every ball so far.1st over: England 9-0 (Roy 5, Bairstow 0) Oh my! Santner’s first delivery is a beautiful arm ball that curves into Roy, beats his attempted cut and just misses the leg stump. It races away for four byes, but that could easily have been a first-baller for Roy. He gets off the mark later in the over by slapping a low full toss through the covers. Doom department: as Mike Atherton says on Sky, if the ball is swinging for the spinner, it will surely do so for Trent Boult.“Very old school choice of Cole Porter lyrics – nice,” says Brian Withington. “First saw George Melly perform it at a British Gas Dinner Dance (!) circa 1980 in an enormous London Hotel ballroom, which he described in his inimitable style as an ‘intimate little boîte’ (to the amusement of those of us with O-level French).”It’s time. The left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner will bowl the first over.You know it’s a big game when ... you have umpteen unread emails before a ball has been bowled. (It’s not as bad as the 2011 semi-final between India and Pakistan, when I had something like 94 unread emails before the toss.) Please keep them coming, even if I’ll struggle to read them all until tonight.“Are they playing on the same pitch as Sri Lanka v West Indies, who both scored well on Monday?” asks Scott Rutherford.No, it’s a new pitch and looks full of runs. The swing of Southee and especially Boult is probably England’s main concern.“Why am I doing this?” says Sam Collier. “I was an absolute wreck on Sunday. I remained that way even while there was only a mathematical chance of India winning. And after England won, as realised I was going to have to go through it all again. Possibly three times. I just need you to tell me it’s going to be okay. Okay?”Thankfully I’ve been an oasis of calm throughout this World Cup, and the crippling nausea I experienced all day Sunday was purely down to an excess of flat whites.“Is there are way - other than trawling through the matches, one by one - to find out the percentage of toss wins that England has achieved during this tournament?” asks Sarah Bacon. “Feels excessive.”They’ve won six out of nine.Dave Voss is confident. “The Fear,” he says. “I’ve got it. I feel sick and trembling and it’s going to be like this all day isn’t it? Is it cowardly to start drinking at 10am?” “We’ve finally made it to a match in England again,” writes Eva Maaten. “The Riverside is quite a change from the Wanderers in Joburg, lovely stadium. Witnessed some good-humoured banter between England and NZ fans on the bus to the stadium - it should be an exciting game on the most perfect of all English cricket days, sunny with picture book clouds.”England are unchanged. New Zealand bring in Matt Henry and Tim Southee for Ish Sodhi and the injured Lockie Ferguson.Kane Williamson says he would also have batted.“On a dark and stormy™ Wellington night, I’m hunkered down and ready for this to get started,” writes my old colleague Paul Cockburn. “I was in the Cake Tin for the monstering NZ gave England in 2015... but down here I think people are nervous England will end the 13k-day streak. The Black Caps have rather lost their way as this compy has unwound, haven’t they?”A little, mainly because they have too many players out of form. But they are – and I forgot to say this in the preamble – a dangerous team to underestimate. “Could you put the standings table up pls?” asks Rob Connelly. “I can’t find the link on the  site.”The things I do for you people.The ferocious Lockie Ferguson is out with a tight hamstring, which is good news for Eoin Morgan’s hook stroke. Matt Henry or Tim Southee will replace him in the New Zealand side.Birds do it. Bees do it. Even educated fleas do it. But let’s not do it. Please, let’s not underestimate New Zealand. Since England’s stirring win over India on Sunday, there has been an unspoken, possibly unconscious assumption that they have nine toes in the semi-final. It’s dangerous, disrespectful and just plain wrong. England are below New Zealand in the table and have not beaten them at a World Cup for 13,173 days.Thankfully, any complacency is unlikely to have spread to the England dressing-room. Eoin Morgan is an unashamed Kiwiphile, and England’s journey (sic) to this point started when they were giving the mother of all shellackings at Wellington in the last World Cup. Under Morgan, England are unlikely to take their eyes off the process. Not today not when so much is at stake. If they get it right, the prize is a first World Cup semi-final in 1992. If they fail, the post-mortem could take some time.

She will show you astonishing things – and leave you agogIt is amazing to see Judi Dench in the wild. Almost the last of her kind – there are thought to be only three or four grandes dames left in the country, mostly roaming round Downton Abbey – the ITV documentary Judi Dench’s Wild Borneo Adventure was a rare chance to see her unscripted and at play. Her natural habitat is the stage and screen, but with the adaptability for which this species is known she looked as comfortable in the jungle as she does anywhere else, from the Lyttelton to exotic Marigold hotels.Hang on, I’m getting a message through my earpiece … Ah. Apparently, we were meant to be marvelling at the creatures and canvas of the tropical rainforest through which Dame Judi journeyed, not Dame Judi herself. But who, really, has ever been able to take their eyes off her when she’s about? She looks, at the age of 84, as she has always looked – part-sprite, part-empress – and sounds like she has always sounded – whisky, honey and just about to tell the filthiest joke – and remains the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen. This time, with orangutans nearby.Her Wild Borneo Adventure was the kind of jolly-with-a-point that is occasionally offered to national treasures. This time, it was a trip to the island land of slow lorises, sun bears, elephants, hornbills and trees that grow straight up into the heavens, all of which we are killing because we are so rapacious in our consumption, because we are so relentless in our quest for profit, because we are so endlessly, fathomlessly stupid. La Dench is a particular fan of orangutans, and this is enough for her to get the job. She sponsors three of them, and I do like to imagine them all sitting in a literal green room together wearing cast-off kaftans and swapping tales about careering round the countryside on Ralph Richardson’s motorbike (“Killed several civilians, darling – nobody cared! It was the 60s!”) while Larry looked askance.With the conservationist David Mills (“my chap”), Dench flew over the deracinated outskirts – the logged forests and palm oil plantations – on into one of the last untouched regions of rainforest in south-east Asia, in the heart of the island. It is also one of the oldest in the world – 130 million years old there when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. There she meets scientists who show her all the extraordinary sights therein, from the dung beetles that clear the floor poo-ball by poo-ball, to the ferns growing 250ft off the ground (she heads up there in a harness while you try not to think about the insurance admin involved) in trees that play host to an estimated 40,000 types of insect, and the harlequin tree frogs that leap and glide among them. There’s also the kubong, which I am not over yet. We watched one of these arboreal mammals jump, stretch out a furry blanket of skin and virtually fly to its next post. It was like watching a billion years of evolution both expand and telescope before you. I’m going to need someone to send Eileen Atkins or Joan Plowright over there to take a more in-depth look.Dench’s greatest contribution – apart from pulling in the punters in the first place – was to treat every revelation of the forest with equal awe and wonder. She was as agog at the insects she saw (the giant katydids were worth the price of admission alone, even if you will never close your eyes easily at night again) as she was the orphan sun bears being released into the jungle after their stay at a local centre that rescues cubs whose parents have been killed for their parts, which are considered valuable in traditional medicine. This approach kept the delicate balance of all the elements of a fragile ecosystem at the forefront of your mind, which should always be the way.So, all we’ve got to do now is stop killing things, despoiling forests, plundering virgin lands and plumbing the depths of stupidity and selfishness. Oh, and keep Dame Judi Dench alive for ever. I know we can do all this if we try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e4e48b08863bd7fec2dd12077953373632ec86/0_0_5061_3038/master/5061.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=797c5b1577fb4ed9f477885c2f9433bb","title":"straight pride organizers suspicious envelopes glitter","story":"Anonymous envelopes sent to members of ‘Super Happy Fun America’ who believe straight people are an ‘oppressed majority’Organizers of Boston’s so-called “Straight Pride” march have revealed that threatening envelopes posted to them and which prompted them to call law enforcement turned out to be full of nothing more hazardous than glitter.The suspicious envelopes, filled with a “granular substance”, were addressed to three members of “Super Happy Fun America”, a group whose membership have previously organized and attended events, some of which have turned violent and who have links to far-right figures.In 2018, Think Progress reported that Resist Marxism had links with white nationalist groups, and that members had expressed antisemitic sentiments in leaked chats.The sender or senders of the glitter parcels remains unknown.

And the French managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will move to Frankfurt to take over from Mario Draghi as the first female president of the ECB once it is formally signed off by the Eurozone group.Von der Leyen, 60, who speaks fluent English and French and studied at the London School of Economics before taking a medical degree, is now the European commission president designate. She will only formally become the first female head of the EU’s executive branch if she wins the support of a majority of MEPs.Donald Tusk, the outgoing president of the European council, said after the marathon talks: “I am really happy about it – after all, Europe is a woman. I think that it was worth waiting for such an outcome.”The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose coalition government abstained in what was otherwise a unanimous decision to back the nomination, said: “For me, it is also a good sign that a woman will have this office for the first time.”Merkel noted that it was the first time in 52 years that a German national would be heading the commission.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, had proposed Von der Leyen to lead the commission after Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Italy rejected the candidature of the Dutch former foreign minister Frans Timmermans over his previous criticism of populist governments which fail to protect the independence of their judiciary.Von der Leyen, a gynaecologist who only came to politics in her early 40s, regularly emerges in opinion polls as one of Germany’s most popular politicians.The mother of seven introduced improved maternity and paternity benefits as Germany’s family affairs minister and drove forward boardroom gender quotas.She has been working to increase funding for the country’s armed forces in her most recent government role although she has been mired in controversy over the awarding of contracts and has faced criticism about gaps in military readiness.On Brexit, she has fully supported the commission’s position on the Northern Irish backstop, and criticised the “hollow promises” of those who campaigned for the UK to leave the EU.At the end of the summit, Tusk said the new leadership would not offer concessions on the Brexit deal struck with London.He told reporters: “I am absolutely sure that the new leaders of our institutions will be as consistent as we are today when it comes to the withdrawal agreement and our readiness to discuss our future relationship with the UK”.Macron confirmed Tusk’s reading of the new leadership’s position on Brexit, adding that the EU should “not be afraid of a no deal”.The president is proposed by the European parliament and nominated by the European council of leaders of the EU member states. They lead the commission\u0027s work in implementing EU policies, chair the weekly commission meetings and set its policy agenda. They also represent the EU at European council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and at bilateral summits with third countries.The role was held by Jean-Claude Juncker from November 2014 until July 2019, when the German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, was nominated to replace him.The 28 heads of state and government, of which only five are women, were under pressure to break the male monopoly on the top jobs although there was never any certainty this would happen.The debate over the future leadership proved extremely difficult, with the leaders talking through the night on Sunday, and needing to meet again on Monday and Tuesday to find the right gender, geographical and political balance for the five top jobs soon to be vacant.Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, 43, has been chosen to replace Donald Tusk as president of the European council. Spain’s foreign minister Josep Borrell, 72, will become the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs if the commission as a whole is signed off by the parliament.The European parliament is expected to elect its own president in a vote in Strasbourg on Wednesday, with the main political groups likely to support David-Maria Sassoli an Italian MEP for the Socialists and Democrats political group, as part of a delicate ision of jobs among the parties.Michel, who is in a caretaker role while Belgium’s politicians seek to negotiate a new federal government following May’s election, is a member of the Renew Europe political group formed out of a combination of the former liberal group in the parliament and French MEPs from Macron’s La République En Marche party.The leaders’ nomination for the commission marks a break with the “Spitzenkandidaten” system, under which lead candidates were chosen by the political groups to campaign for the post during the elections.Juncker was appointed in 2014 after his European People’s party group became the biggest party. This time he had championed the candidacy of Manfred Weber after the EPP group again proved to be the largest party, albeit weakened and in a more fractured parliament.He said he feared the nomination might run into trouble when MEPs had their say. The parliament is able to reject the leaders’ candidate, and the entirety of the new president’s commission.“The solution we’ve found is a good one,” Juncker said. “Ursula von der Leyen has extensive experience in defence and social policy. I believe it would be in the European parliament’s interest to approve this, though I am sad the Spitzenkandidat process suffered a setback.”Tusk added: “I am not a prophet. It’s not for me to assess what is the real chance to achieve success in the parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944259.1562077584!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"heatwave made five times more likely by climate change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA woman cools off in the fountain of the Trocadero esplanade in Paris on June 25th.

Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFPGetty ImagesMan-made climate change probably made last month’s European heatwave, in which southern France experienced a national record 45.9 degrees, 4 degrees hotter than it would otherwise have been, scientists said on Tuesday.“Climate change is no longer an abstract increase in global mean temperature, but a difference you can feel when you step outside in a heatwave,” said Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Senior Researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and one of the paper’s authors.“The observations show . . . similarly frequent heat waves would have likely been about 4C cooler a century ago,” said the report by the World Weather Attribution group of scientists.It also said that climate change had made the record-breaking heatwave at least five times more likely.“We experienced a heatwave whose intensity could become the norm in the middle of the century,” said Robert Vautard, senior scientist at France’s CNRS institute.Climate scientists have long said that a warming of the earth’s surface caused mainly by industrial-era emissions of carbon-dioxide from fossil fuels will make weather events more extreme, and make those extremes – such as storms, drought and flooding – more frequent.The World Weather Attribution group used computer models over three days from June 26-28th to calculate the temperatures they would otherwise have expected.France’s new record modern-day temperature, registered in Gallargues-le-Montueux, in the southerly Provence region, was nearly two degrees above the previous high recorded in August 2003.Meteorologists say a weakening of the high-level jet stream over Europe is increasingly causing weather systems to stall and leading summer temperatures to soar.The World Meteorological Organization said on Friday that 2019 was on track to be among the world’s hottest years, and that 2015-2019 would then be the hottest five-year period on record.It said the European heatwave was “absolutely consistent” with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. – Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Bogdan Hainal (28) was one of three men who entered Paul and Patrick Kenny\u0026rsquos home in 2014Germany\u0026rsquos defence minister advanced as next European Commission president.\u0026lsquoExceptional\u0026rsquo circumstances led to limitation period delay, judge saysFindings suggest horse\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoattitude\u0026rsquo may be critical factor in training regime -reportPolitics digest: Varadkar stands with rebels against MerkelCancer Research UK says more needs to be done to help people lose weightMinisters to consider plans for increases in allowances for up to 2,500 staffDog board and club to go before Oireachtas as sponsors cancel deals over RT\u0026Eacute revelationsParty tables Bill amendment about \u0026lsquounnecessarily aggressive\u0026rsquo questioning of womenFamily court: Fearful father tells court he feels intimidated by son\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquoviolent tempers\u0026rsquoFianna F\u0026aacuteil says David McCourt should make an appearance to address concerns\u0026lsquoI am so lost without you,\u0026rsquo writes partner of boxer in a letter left at the scene of the deathRashmi (24) is campaigning for a pathway to residency for young undocumented peopleTests have been carried out on private water source at Croagh Kilfinny GAA GroundsRev Trevor Sargent emphasises social justice, human rights and humility at Dublin forumMinister of State to meet chair and board of Irish Greyhound Board to discuss dog welfare issuesSiobh\u0026aacuten Jordan was 100m from finish line during race in Dublin when she collapsed"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944642.1562096902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry s tea and fbd insurance pull greyhound racing funding","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBarry’s Tea and FBD Insurance have pulled their sponsorship of greyhound racing in the aftermath of an RTÉ programme on the industry.

They had said at the weekend that their sponsorship of the sport was under review.The companies had relatively small involvement in sponsorship, with Barry’s Tea backing a race in Cork and FBD having an arrangement with Kilkenny Greyhound Stadium. Industry sources said while the loss of the sponsorship would not present a commercial threat, the departure of two household names would be a blow to a sport that has struggled to attract sponsors in recent years. It could also increase pressure on headline sponsors such as Boylesports, which is among greyhound racing’s biggest commercial partners.The RTÉ Investigates programme last week raised concerns over the treatment of dogs and potential widespread culling of thousands of animals based on performance.The sponsorship development comes as the Irish Greyhound Board and Irish Coursing Club have been asked to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture next Tuesday. Committee chairman Pat Deering TD said they will be asked what structures are being put in place after the recent revelations. “We want to see exactly how quickly they will do this,” he said. “The Irish Greyhound Board will have received €16 million in Government funding this year.

Photograph: by Frederick FlorinAFPNigel Farage and his Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the European Parliament. As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber on the first day of the new parliament, the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall.Labour’s leader in the European parliament, Richard Corbett, later described the move as pathetic.More than three months after Britain was scheduled to leave the EU, 73 British MEPs have arrived in Strasbourg to take up a mandate that is due to expire on October 31st, the new deadline.The Brexit Party’s 29 MEPs marked their arrival in Strasbourg, with a photograph underneath the 28 national flags outside the Strasbourg parliament. A few wore turquoise ties, the colour of the party intended to mark the difference with Ukip purple, Mr Farage’s old party.Mr Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999, said Brexit Party MEPs would stay beyond October 31st “if we have to stay longer” and delivered a carefully-crafted message to the two Conservatives battling to become prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Crude slogan“Now we have two contenders telling us whatever happens, come hell or high water we are leaving on the 31st of October,” he said. “I don’t believe a word they say but I will give them this warning: if they don’t deliver Brexit on that date they are toast and then we will then see a turquoise takeover.”His new MEPs cheered as Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party was the biggest in Europe. While the 29 Brexit MEPs are the joint largest party in the European Parliament (along with Germany’s CDU-CSU alliance), Mr Farage has been unable to forge a pan-European group, meaning he will no longer have a prime-time speaking slot in European Parliament debates.Massing on the other side of the parliament, the British Liberal Democrats also trumpeted their arrival by walking into the chamber together wearing yellow T-shirts emblazoned with their campaign slogan Bollocks to Brexit. The party has a record 16 MEPs, while Labour and the Conservatives have been reduced to all-time lows.Chris Davies, re-elected for the Liberal Democrats after losing his seat in 2014, said he expected to serve out his full five-year term. “Of course I do. If Brexit isn’t delivered by the 31st of October I don’t think it will happen. There is no majority in the country there is no majority in the House of Commons.”The MEP denied the crude slogan was unparliamentary. He said that when he met MEP colleagues who told him he would stay only a few months, “I say no. ‘I am here for five years. Bollocks to Brexit.’ And I get the same reaction every time: a big smile. It’s amazing how well Bollocks to Brexit translates into 24 different languages.”Protests were also held against the decision to deny a seat to Catalan separatist Carles Puigdemont and this issue was addressed by Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy. Newly elected Irish MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly arrived for their first sitting of the parliament wearing matching teeshirts emblazoned with the slogan “Free Assange - No US extradition”. Tuesday marks the opening of the new five-year session of the parliament, though the length of the UK’s involvement remains in doubt.UK MEPs may sit in the parliament until the country formally leaves the EU.A deadline of October 31st has currently been set for the UK to leave, though this could be extended if a deal is not found by then. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944509.1562106072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ursula von der leyen profile who is proposed new eu commission president","story":"German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen was attending an away day for the Bundeswehr armed forces on Tuesday, 45 minutes south of Berlin, when her name began circulating as a possible new president of the European Commission.As a woman and a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU), part of the European People’s Party (EPP), the 60-year-old already ticked two important boxes to head the sprawling EU executive.In addition, she is trilingual, speaking French and English alongside her native German. Though at home near Hanover, Lower Saxony, she was born in Ixelles in the southern suburbs of Brussels and grew up as the daughter of an influential Lower Saxon politician and later state premier, Ernst Albrecht.In addition, the so-called Visegrád states – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – were reportedly not opposed to the idea of her appointment.The appointment would solve one problem for Merkel but caused complications elsewhere. It would end Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann’s ambitions of heading the European Central Bank (ECB) and block EPP spitzenkandidat (lead candidate) Manfred Weber from any top job. That would be seen as a betrayal by Weber’s colleagues in Bavaria’s ruling Christian Social Union (CSU) – Merkel’s conservative allies.“After years of anonymous EU leaders we agreed on the lead candidate system to increase European election legitimacy,” said a CSU source to The . “Ignoring the candidates people voted for at the first opportunity would be very difficult to communicate.”Asked if ditching Weber for Von der Leyen would cause a crisis in Berlin’s ruling grand coalition, the CSU source added: “By no means.”Medical doctorVon der Leyen is Lutheran and a medical doctor by training. She married in 1986 and has seven children, the youngest now 20.Seen as a liberal and reliable pair of hands, she has held three posts at the Merkel cabinet table. As family minister (2005-2009) she boosted funding for childcare, generating controversy in the more conservative wing of her own political camp. As labour and welfare minister (2009-2013) she oversaw a toughening up of the Schröder era reform programme.Her greatest challenge has been as defence minister since 2013. Her task: to retool and rebuild the Bundeswehr after years of underinvestment and ongoing confusion over its role at home and abroad. It has proven a complex, perplexing and often thankless task – in particular amid growing US pressure on Germany to boost its military spending in line with Nato commitments.She made several decisions that earned respect within the ranks: agreeing to buy unmanned drones backing weapons deliveries to Iraqi militias battling Islamic State forces and adding a new cyber warfare pillar alongside the army, navy and Luftwaffe.But, now in her sixth year in defence, she is increasingly unpopular over a series of cost overruns on military aircraft, as well a surge in spending on outside consultants.Never a close political ally of Merkel, Von der Leyen was once considered a potential reserve chancellor. However, the minister eventually took herself out of the succession stakes, pointing to the four-year age difference between the two women.It remains to be seen whether the European Parliament will back Von der Leyen as successor to Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Tripoli government blames self-styled Libyan National Army for attackUnited States has increased military presence in regionPrincess who invited Mary Robinson to Dubai in aftermath of Latifa case flees UAEMiddle Eastern royals had previously been in the spotlight over fate of Princess LatifaMove defies European warning to stick to terms of 2015 agreement despite US sanctionsYoung men\u0026rsquos right to skip army for yeshiva religious schools at risk as elections loomIsrael threatens to reinstate sanctions if commitments are not fulfilledUS sanctions inflaming tensions without punishing those responsible, say expertsUS president insists he does not \u0026lsquoneed exit strategies\u0026rsquo when asked about risk of Iran warTens of thousands have driving licences but activists are detained and laws still restrictiveMany foreigners among 55,000 captured Islamic State fighters and their families detainedPalestinians boycotting event, while Israelis not invitedTurkey\u0026rsquos ruling party concedes defeat in vote that will have major repercussionsMove after US aviation agency issues order following shooting-down of US drone in regionPresident condemns downing of aircraft but says it may not have been intentional\u0026lsquoJoints will be separated, it will not be a problem,\u0026rsquo journalist\u0026rsquos killers were assured\u0026lsquoBaseless allegations\u0026rsquo: Saudi official rejects report by rights investigator as \u0026lsquonothing new\u0026rsquoDeath of ousted former president likely to increase pressure on Cairo over human rights recordWhite House calls move \u0026lsquonuclear blackmail\u0026rsquo as 2015 deal in danger of total collapseWife of Israeli prime minister is fined more than $15,000 under plea bargain"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945195.1562142444!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"another dubai princess defects anguished poetry ensues","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum with Princess Haya, the most visible and glamorous of  his reported six wives, at the Epsom Derby festival  in England on June 3rd, 2017.

Photograph:  AFPGetty ImagesFew world leaders are known to write poetry. Fewer still offer it up for public consumption. And almost none record their marital breakups in verse on their personal websites. Then there is the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who has been publishing his romantic anguish online, in Arabic and English, for anyone with an internet connection to read. “O sweetheart, there’s nothing more to say.Your deathly silence has worn me out,” he wrote in one poem posted on his official website. “You no longer have a place with me,” says another. “I don’t care if you live or die.” Princess Haya, the most visible and glamorous of the sheikh’s reported six wives, has left him. She fled with their 11- and 7-year-old children to London several months ago, a person close to the royal family said, making her at least the third woman to flee Sheikh Mohammed’s palaces in Dubai, the largest city of the United Arab Emirates. Haya (45) is seeking political asylum in Britain and is asking for a orce, said the person, who asked not to be identified speaking about a sensitive family matter. Her defection follows attempts by two of Sheikh Mohammed’s daughters, Sheikha Shamsa al-Maktoum and Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed al-Maktoum. They were recaptured by Emirati forces and are said by advocates to be held in Dubai against their will.Haya has been criticised for her role in helping to, in the words of critics, whitewash the disappearance of Latifa, by inviting her friend, former president Mary Robinson, to visit Dubai and testify to Latifa’s well-being. Haya has not been seen recently or spoken publicly about her departure, and the sheikh’s poems do not identify the subject by name. The governments of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates did not respond to requests for comment. ‘Perfect couple’Haya’s biography is well-travelled ground in the British press, which frequently reported her appearances, along with her husband, at Royal Ascot, the Epsom Derby and other highlights of the English equestrian calendar. She is a daughter of Jordan’s previous king, Hussein was educated at British private schools studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford represented Jordan as a showjumper at the 2000 Olympics is a former president of the International Equestrian Federation and is reported to be friendly, along with her husband, with Queen Elizabeth II.The Emirati press frequently wrote tributes to her humanitarian work and her marriage to Sheikh Mohammed (69), whom she wed in a small ceremony in Amman in 2004. “We can’t get enough of these two,” Emirates Woman magazine wrote in a feature titled “11 Moments Sheikh Mohammed and Princess Haya Were the Perfect Couple.” The article chronicled their joint visits to Royal Ascot where the sheikh, who owns a heavyweight racing stable in England called Godolphin, is a regular.But the princess was conspicuously absent at this year’s Royal Ascot in June. The Times of London reported on Monday that she was living with the couple’s two children, Sheikh Zayed and Sheikha Al Jalila, in a mansion near Kensington Palace worth about $107 million. Other unconfirmed media reports said that she first sought asylum in Germany before landing in London.A German government spokesman told The  earlier this week that it could not confirm the report, and the German interior ministry said it had no information on the case.Divorce is likely to be complicated for royals with two young children, billions of dollars and a tangle of political relationships, including the United Arab Emirates’ long-standing alliances with Britain and Jordan, at stake. The princess is a half sister of Jordan’s King Abdullah II. While men can easily orce their wives under Islamic law, which governs marriage in the UAE, women must go to court and overcome several legal barriers before they can end a marriage. Though orced women may retain day-to-day custody of children up to a certain age, legal ship of the children – and control of their education and finances – generally goes to the man.What makes Haya’s departure especially intriguing is her role in the case of Latifa – whose mother is another of the sheikh’s wives – and whether, at some point, she may shed more light on it. Robinson interventionLatifa tried to escape last year what she said was a suffocating existence in Dubai. She got as far as a yacht on the Indian Ocean, headed for India and then the United States, when she was forcibly retaken by armed Emiratis who took her back to Dubai, her companions said.Sheikh Mohammed’s office issued a statement in December, saying that she was safe in Dubai, celebrating her 33rd birthday with family “in privacy and peace”. Latifa has not been publicly seen since her escape attempt except in December, when her family released photographs of her meeting with Robinson, the former president of Ireland and United Nations human rights commissioner, in what seemed to be an attempt to show that the sheikha was alive and well.Haya, who has said she had been friendly with Robinson for years, had invited Robinson to Dubai for the visit. Both women drew criticism for appearing to help justify the disappearance of Latifa, who looked dazed and inert in the photographs.An activist who has worked on Latifa’s case, Radha Stirling, called on Princess Haya to co-operate with international authorities to investigate wrongdoing by Sheikh Mohammed. “Princess Haya, in all likelihood, is both a victim and a witness,” Stirling said in a statement. (A spokesman for the Jordanian Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The British Foreign Office declined to comment, and a spokesman for the British Home Office, which handles asylum claims, said the office could not comment on inidual cases. Though the couple were married in Jordan and are both Emirati citizens, James Stewart, an international family lawyer at Penningtons Manches Cooper in London, said orce negotiations could proceed in London as long as Haya could establish residency there. While complications might arise in a British court because the marriage was polygamous, he said, wealthy international couples with complicated circumstances often hold out-of-court settlement talks in London in part because of the legal system’s privacy protections.Whatever the final terms, Sheikh Mohammed may be ready to grant the princess a orce. “We have an ailment that no medicine can cure,” the sheikh wrote in another recent poem. “No experts in herbs can remedy this.” – New York Times"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTory leadership latest: Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock at odds over promise to end \u0026#39sin tax\u0026#39China accuses Hunt of \u0026#39fantasising in faded glory of British colonialism\u0026#39 in protest over Hong Kong warningTeachers who try to be friends with pupils are failing black boys, education expert warnsJuly 4th 2019: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayWhat is Article 50?

But the French exchange is becoming a thing of the past, according to a British Council report which found that red tape is partly to blame for its decline.Sending children on exchanges has “fallen out of fashion” in part due to the “safeguarding culture” and Government red tape, according to Vicky Gough, schools advisor to the British Council.Guidelines from the Department for Education state that English families that host foreign pupils should undergo Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks and for this reason many schools and local authorities are put off, she said.“Because the regulations say parents should be DBS-checked, this makes people think this is a risky undertaking,” Ms Gough told the . “Some schools and local authorities don’t allow any to take place for this reason. The whole culture of safeguarding has changed”.Now just a quarter (25 per cent) of state secondaries now offer exchanges, down from 29 per cent last year and 30 per cent in 2014, the British Council’s annual language trends survey found.The poll of 1,600 teachers showed that while a greater proportion of private schools organise exchanges, they have seen a steeper decline over the same time period.Just under half (48 per cent) of fee-paying schools currently offer the trips, down from 53 per cent last year and 77 per cent in 2014.“When I was at school everyone did an exchange, everyone’s older brothers and sisters had done one,” Ms Gough said.“If it’s something that has always happened, pupils have heard about it from others and seen their photos, they feel comfortable.  “But when it falls out fashion and falls out of the school’s culture, it then sounds a bit odd and risky.”Ms Gough said that exchanges may be declining faster in private schools than in their state counterparts due to the management being more “risk averse” and cautionary.At a glance | How to learn another languageShe said state schools are under more financial as well as time pressure, and may not see organising exchange trips as a priority.Ms Gough told how at in the mid 1990s, every secondary school in Durham did one or even two exchanges, but now there is only one secondary left that does it.The number of pupils taking French and German GCSEs and A-levels has plummeted in recent years.Entries for GCSEs in both subjects has dropped by 30 per cent over the past five years, while Spanish has dropped by a more modest two per cent. A-level entries are also declining, but at more gradual rate.Earlier this year, the Government set up a £2.5 million fund for schools to spend on taking disadvantaged children on trips abroad, including foreign language exchange trips. Ministers hope that the move will boost the numbers of pupils taking modern foreign languages at GCSE.Do you have fond memories of foreign exchanges from schooldays gone by?

If she was abused, she could not go to the police if she wanted a orce, she could not go to the courts.“Princess Haya, in all likelihood, is both a victim and a witness and thus we hope she will remain safe, and that she will also cooperate with international authorities to expose the alleged abuses going on behind the doors of the Dubai Royal Palace.”China accuses Hunt of \u0026#39fantasising in faded glory of British colonialism\u0026#39 in protest over Hong Kong warningTory leadership latest: Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock at odds over promise to end \u0026#39sin tax\u0026#39Teachers who try to be friends with pupils are failing black boys, education expert warnsJuly 4th 2019: How a tax on playing cards and a thwarted tea shipment led to American Independence DayWhat is Article 50?

Equality, dignity and the right of self-determination for millions of women across the Middle East is at stake.“We hope that Princess Haya and her children are safe and that she well use her new found freedom to speak publicly about what has really happened to Lata and we would urge her to contact us and join our campaign.”In July it was reported that Princess Haya is living in a £million town house in Kensington Palace Gardens in London.She is said to be fearing for her le after she learned more details about Latasto Dubai, alleging she was taken back against her will.The BBC reports that Princess Haya believes she could be abducted herself and rendered back to Dubai.He is said to have asked authorities in Berlin tothe princess, son Zayed, seven, and daughter Al Jalila, , to the UAE.But they have refused and security officials are said to be protecting her.This has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Germany and the UAE.Since Princess Haya disappeared, Sheikh Mohammed has denounced his we in a rant on Instagram, accusing her of “betrayal”, adding: “Go to whom you get busy with!!!!! ” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy hunt liam fox trade brexit","story":"It’s made Brits wealthier and boosted our standing. From Pakistan to Poland, Israel to Ireland and South Africa to Switzerland, people enjoy the best of British.But there is undoubtedly more to do to turbocharge trade. That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An emergency Budget. Huge sums found to keep certain industries afloat. Civil service holidays scrapped.Hunt, though, is unlikely to become PM. Andhe does we doubt even he believes he would preside over No Deal.Boris Johnson is more likely to do both — and must have a similar strategy. It was crazy that Mrs May did not.Today Dominic Grieve’s bid to block No Deal by threatening to inflict ­poverty on millions may be put to a vote. Labour may back it. Good luck explaining that to pensioners and those on benefits.No Deal remains the fallback. Let’s be as ready as we can.SIR Clf Richard and DJ Paul Gambaccini are innocent men who were ly accused and shamefully treated by the police and the BBC.But they are wrong to demand ­anonymity until charge for suspected sex offenders.Had paedophile TV star Stuart Hall not been named on his arrest he might have swatted away the three claims against him and lived on as a national treasure. Publicity triggered a flood of new accusations, proving a pattern of behaviour.Likewise for cab rapist John Worboys.We greatly sympathise with Clf and Paul. But the answer must not be an affront to open justice which risks the guilty getting away with crimes.It is for police to be less credulous as they sort fantasists from victims, to charge or clear suspects far more ­rapidly and to punish all  accusers.Secrecy is not the solution.LABOUR’S limitless self-harm continues.Taxing children for parental gts is a sucker punch for young middle-class urban Remainers — rapidly becoming Labour’s core vote — who rely on mum and dad to help them buy or rent.And the working class face punishment too. The pensions of , ex-miners, British Coal and British Steel workers will be trashed by Labour’s cut-price nationalisation of the private utilities they’re invested in.Labour detests the rich.

It shook the kitchen.I thought my house was falling down. I went upstairs and looked out window and saw the body.John had been out sunbathing. He is a lodger and is friends with Bob the owner.I saw John outside he was shaking and trembling. He wasnt saying anything. He could hardly speak.My husband called the police. It was horric.John, a software engineer in his s who previously worked for Ticketmaster, has since fled back to his hometown of Exeter, Devon as he comes to terms with the near-miss.The corpse fell from the passenger plane at around .pm as it came in to land at Heathrow following a nine-hour flight from Nairobi.Airline workers said a bag, water and stash of food were later found in the planes landing gear - where the stowaway had been hiding.The body only narrowly missed a packed Clapham Common and High Street where families were out in their droves in the C heatwave.John, who rents a room in the four-storey house from pal Bob Renwick, is said to be struggling to come to terms with the ordeal and is being comforted by parents Michael and Phi.Johns friend said: “He was so lucky not to be hit and killed. The impact obliterated the body.“He didn’t even realise what it was to begin with. He was asleep and then there was a huge impact.“The body literally landed one metre away from him and was obliterated. My friend was very shaken.“There were a few of us in the house at the time and it was lucky only one of us was in the garden.“Nobody would have survived being hit. The impact was horric.”John has been living in the property for around six months, moving in while working for Bobs firm Plexi, based in Bermondsey, London, and Birmingham.Another neighbour added: “I heard a whomp so I went to look out the window. At first I thought it was a tramp asleep. He had all his clothes on and everything.I had a closer look. I saw there was blood all over the walls of the garden and his head was not in a good way.The Clapham resident said a plane spotter, who had been following flight KQ on an app from Clapham Common, had seen the body fall, and arrived almost at the same time as the police.He added: “I spoke to Heathrow and they said this happens once every five years. There was a previous man who was frozen and this one, he was like an ice block.”The Kenya Airways flight passed over the house just after .pm on Sunday — descending to around ,ft and flying at mph as it prepared to land.Landlord Bob Renwicks brother said John “very badly shaken.He added: “It was a narrow miss. The garden isn’t very big.“There was more than a lot of blood. It wasn’t pretty and caused a signicant amount of damage.”The force of the impact was so severe that police were initially unable to tell whether the body was male or female.It is now understood the man was wearing a blue t-shirt and jeans. Forensics examined the scene for five hours before removing evidence.One female resident said: There was an almighty bang. My husband went out into the street where my neighbour was standing on the phone to the police.He was really shaken up. Hed been in the garden when it happened and the body must have landed so close to where he was.My husband came back in and I asked him what was going on and he said havent you seen the man  The man who fell from the sky I wondered what he was talking about and went up to see for myself and there in the middle of the lawn was a body of a man.The stowaway, who has not been identied, is believed to have been working at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. Investigators are understood to have found CCTV footage of him.A source told The Sun: “It looks highly likely he was an employee as security has been beefed up and no one without a pass could get near a plane. He could have been a baggage handler or one of a number of staff given airside clearance.“It’s possible that he could have bribed someone to get inside the perimeter but this seems unlikely and the CCTV will hold the key.”He is likely to have blacked out just  minutes after take-off as oxygen levels fell and would have been frozen to death by temperatures of around -.C.A source said: “There have been rare cases where stowaways have survived but in the main they lose consciousness because of a lack of oxygen and hypothermia and then they fall when the wheels go down.”A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “This is a shocking incident and our thoughts are with those involved.“While we do not comment on operational matters, we are liaising with the Kenyan authorities and the air carrier as they carry out their investigation into this incident.”Mozambican Carlito Vale hit an office roof in Richmond, South West London, in June  after plunging from a British Airways jet.A second man miraculously survived the same -hour flight from South Africa in the undercarriage of the plane.A -year-old Romanian man also survived in the undercarriage of a private jet from Vienna to Heathrow in .It had flown at comparatively low altitude with enough oxygen for him to breathe.But Turkish stowaway Kikmet Komur, , froze to death in the landing gear compartment of a BA jet in July .He hoped to get from Istanbul to the UK to see his girlfriend.There are no recorded incidents of anyone hit by a falling body from a plane in the UK.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

These stick to the hair – usually close to the scalp – and are often still seen after treatment has killed all the lice.There are two main treatments for head lice. The first is strictly physical – wet combing using conditioner and a specially designed ‘bug busting’ comb.They can cause an itchy scalp and general discomfort as the parasites live by feeding on human blood.Nits are particularly common in school children aged between -.But heres some facts you might not have heard about nits...It’s time consuming and needs to be repeated several times - repeated every few days until you’ve had three sessions in a row where you have not seen any live lice.However, it is very effective when done properly and can be used regularly to check for new infestations.The second is to use topical treatments - lotions etc - to kill the bugs. These are ided into two main types.The first are chemical insecticides, which poison the lice. There have been lots of problems in recent years with head lice becoming resistant to these chemical insecticides.The second type is the physical insecticide.

The hospital has apologised to Wendy Robertson and son Daniel over his treatment. Ms Robertson, , had taken Daniel to Hullaposs Westbourne NHS Centre over fears he had a chest infection. The mum says she and Daniel, who is non-verbal and also has epilepsy, were then sent to Hull Royal Infirmary with a letter from the doctor advising that Daniel needed intravenous antibiotics. However, when the pair arrived they were sent to the acute medical unit where Ms Robertson says Daniel was left with bruises all over his body after nurses repeatedly tried to take blood samples off him, reports Hull Live. The Hull NHS trust has since apologised to Mrs Roberton, saying their standard of care fell short.  Ms Roberton said the pair arrived at the acute medical unit at pm, and it was four hours until they saw anyone. She said: A nurse came and said he had to have a blood test done and he was trying to take his bloods for what must have been about an hour but he couldnapost do it. He wanted to get some sleep and heaposd had enough by then. The nurse left and he left the needles and equipment in the room, which wasnapost very safe so I took them back out to the nursesapos station and she said she would tell the other one not to leave it there again.    But Mrs Roberton claimed her son was then left in a pool of urine for an hour, which she had to wipe up with her cardigan. She said: It got to .am and he wouldnapost sleep, he was scared and then he had an epileptic fit. I thought the stress of the day had brought it on. The next thing I know, the nurse who had done the bloods came back and I was ushered out of the room and lots of other doctors and nurses came running in. They shut the door and all I could hear was banging and crashing and really loud noises. I fell on the floor and had an asthma attack. I screamed out and managed to shout, aposDonapost hurt him.apos Someone came out and said I could then go in and see him.    Ms Roberton alleged that after the fit her son, who was  at the time, was left covered in bruises that spanned his whole body.

Letter of apology from nurses Soon after the incident, which happened on March  this year, she received a call and a letter of apology from the wardaposs matron who said that an unacceptable amount of time was taken trying to take blood from Daniel. She was offered a home visit by some of the hospitalaposs nurses but turned it down. A letter she was sent said: Please accept my sincere apologies for the distress your son and you have experienced as a result of the circumstances. The issues have been investigated and then shared with myself, senior matron. I contacted you to discuss the findings and it was clear through discussion that your son was let down by the team and I was saddened to learn that your son is now very scared of hospitals.    An unacceptable amount of time was spent trying to obtain a blood sample and his hygiene needs were not met. Sister X will remind the team that they must work within their limitations andthey are not able to obtain a blood sample in a timely manner they are to seek support from the anaesthetic team who are experts in obtaining blood samples and access in dficult circumstances.

Xavier Parkins  was crowned the Lees Brook Community Schoolaposs prom queen in Derbyshire last week. Days before he turned  the teenager strutted his stuff in outfit starring a short, pink strapless dress that took six hours to perfect. He became the first boy to win the schoolaposs prom queen at the event at Pride Park Stadium in Derby, Derbyshire Live reported. While the reaction to his victory has largely been positive, some people have aimed jibes at Xavier, suggesting he aposneeded a father figure in his leapos and that a girl should have won the crown.    But he isnapost bothered by the haters. He said: Every negative comment has made me laugh, Iaposve turned it into a positive. Negative comments make me want to do it even more. They make me want to put four wigs on at a time and wear five layers of foundation. I read through all the comments but Iaposve only responded to two or three ones which got to me because of how personal they were. Xavier said the comments question whether he should have won havenapost affected him because of the positive things he associates with dragging up. Getting all the attention was good and Iaposm grateful for it but it isnapost what I intended, he continued. Drag makes me feel so empowered and confident, itaposs just fun. Iaposm just being me but I look dferent. Winning Prom Queen is what every girl wants.  Xavier first went out wearing make-up at a show when he was invited up on stage with RuPaulaposs Drag Race judge Michelle Visage. When he won a lip-syncing competition at the show he decided to dress in drag at the prom. He bought his first wig on a shopping trip and went home to dance around his living room while wearing his mumaposs heels.    More wigs followed as Xavier starting building a collection of his own home-made clothes. The teenageraposs family have been supportive as have his friends, who said the idea to don a dress at the event was sick. His mum Sharnee, , said some people who commented were using religion to justy their actions.    She added: You do read the comments and it is very dficult not to reply, but sometimes silence is more powerful. People messaged me saying seeing Xavier has really helped their child and thataposs just wonderful. Itaposs so unexpected actually and thataposs just the icing on the cake. Iaposm so proud. Xavier is set to perform at Derby Pride on September .    Toni Jacobs, a trustee for Derby Pride, said: It’s truly heartwarming to see a local school supporting the right of young people to express themselves freely. Drag has always been a very important part of LGBT+ culture, both as a performance and as a way of exploring gender identity and self-expression. Encouraging and supporting young people to be themselves is very important and celebrating ersity leads to a more accepting society for all.” "},{"url":null,"title":"bumble couple who married first","story":"NewsBumble couple who married on first date in Las Vegas orce after just two monthsSarah Elliott and Paul Edwards tied the knot in Las Vegas on Christmas Day just hours after they met at Gatwick AirportShareCommentsByChris kitchingSenior Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv tv-news video bumble-couple-who-married-after-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA nanny who married a stranger just days after they met on the Bumble dating app says she got a orce after just two months toto her polyamorous lestyle. Sarah Elliott, , and lighting technician Paul Edwards, , tied the knot in Las Vegas on Christmas Day just hours after they met in person for the first time. The pair wore their wedding outfits at Gatwick Airport as they boarded a flight to the US. They had matched on the dating app just ten days earlier and even before meeting face-to-face they had the crazy idea to have a shotgun wedding. Ms Elliott - who later revealed her love of BDSM and sex fetish parties - said her marriage is over and she has sworn off monogamy.    The couple had been living with two of her ex-boyfriends, also called Paul, and there were claims Sarah was sacked from her job as a nanny after photos of her at BDSM and sex fetish parties emerged. One showed her walking around in a topless corset and leading around a man in golden mask at a Torture Garden event in Brighton. Ms Elliott has said she loves being a dominatrix and she has had trouble finding a man to keep up with her high sex drive.  She said she is now dating two toy boys - aged  and  - and will never settle for having just one partner again. She also said she will never date another man named Paul again. She told the Sun: “My marriage may be over but it has opened me up to a whole new world.  “I no longer believe monogamy and marriage is the be-all and end-all. “Now I’m living the polyamorous lestyle and loving it. She claims she tried to introduce her then-husband to the world of BDSM and sex fetishes, even taking him to a Torture Garden event in Brighton, where Ms Elliott was previously pictured topless.  She claims they went to a swingers’ night at Le Boudoir, a club in central London, shortly before they split, but it only further strained their relationship. Ms Elliott claims they split for good just days before their two-month anniversary after couplesapos counselling failed. Mr Edwards hasnapost commented on the split.  Ms Elliott, originally from New Zealand and now living in Crowborough, East Sussex, said her family and friends thought she was bonkers for marrying a complete stranger, so the orce did not come as a surprise to them. She had previously told how the marriage was rocky while she and Mr Edwards were living with two of her ex-boyfriends. Despite everything they had talked about having children. Dad-of-two Mr Edwards had moved from his home in Chichester, West Sussex, to be with his new we. Ms Elliott said the former couple still speak, but they have not seen each other since they split in February.

But a CCTV camera at the Judge Roy Beans bar in Newbridge, Co Kildare, Ireland, caught her appearing to place the shard in her own mouth.Pub owner Vivian Carroll told Irish Mirror: Sadly, this is typical of what I and many other publicans face on a weekly basis. It’s clear from the footage that after hiding glass in her clothes, this person then deliberately places it in her mouth. She told a member of staff that the glass was in her food, which was obviously not the case. Butit wasn’t for security cameras I could possibly have faced a massive claim.    She said the entire incident had been recorded and the Gardaí were alerted, but they let her go after taking her details. Padraig Cirbben, chief executive of Vintneraposs Federation of Ireland, slammed the aposcompo cultureapos saying it could force businesses to close. He said: The so-called aposcompo cultureapos stems from the fact that people think they can get away with making outrageous insurance claims, a belief supported and encouraged by some within the legal sector and facilitated by insurers settling dubious claims.    Peter Boland, director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, said: This footage is a timely reminder of the type of personal injury incidents experienced by organisations all over Ireland and the crippling insurance costs they cause. Unsustainable insurance costs are now pervasive right across Irish society and threaten the ability of small businesses, charities, voluntary groups, sports and arts organisations and festivals toor survive.Equally, incidents like this demonise legitimate claimants for whom insurance cover is intended.    He added: The slow pace of reform by Government to address this crisis is compounding the issue. Despite all the political promises we have heard, we have yet to see tangible evidence of reforms that will make a real dference.  Reforms like the establishment of a fully-funded and resourced Gardaí response, a meaningful reduction in the level of general damages being granted for minor, fully-recovered injuries and a commitment from the insurance industry to quanty the scale of promised premium reductions.

A photo of Pte Gue and L Cpl Zulu was allegedly defaced with ­swastikas, Hitler moustaches and the words “f*** off”. Pte Gue said he felt “racism was systemic within the Army and nothing was being done”.  He added: “My experiences of racial harassment and ­discrimination during the course of my employment have led me to realise that the Army is not the honourable ­institution I once thought it to be.” Both men claim there was an attempted cover-up and that officials did not acknowledge their reason for leaving. While in Kenya their colleagues called children begging for food “shit c**ts” and the country a “sh*****e”, the tribunal was told. Pte Gue said: “I was stunned by the racial abuse. I confided in Mr Zulu and he shared my feelings of hurt and anger.” Ugandan Pte Gue said the racial slurs were “often passed off as ‘banter’, although I found it very intimidating”.  It was said Pte Gue moved companies “as a result of the shocking behaviour”. He said his door and another private’s were “urinated on, have bottles smashed on them, and racial slurs written”. He requested early termination last year but his confirmation “did not state my reason for leaving was racial discrimination or harassment”. The tribunal heard that at his and L Cpl Zulu’s leaving party a colleague said: “If I ever see you in the street I’ll bang you so hard you’ll wish you hadn’t done what you’ve done.” Pte Gue wants a public apology to him and L Cpl Zulu, and Kenyan soldiers and nationals. He said: “No amount of money will ever be able to truly compensate me.” The hearing continues Kingsway Employment Tribunal in central London "},{"url":null,"title":"hunt man seen cctv running","story":"NewsHunt for man seen on CCTV running away from murdered pregnant mums homeKelly Mary Fauvrelle, who was eight months pregnant, was stabbed to death and her baby boy - who has since died - was delivered by paramedics at her home in Croydon, south LondonShareByChris kitchingSenior Reporter:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video hunt-man-seen-cctv-running-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDetectives probing the murder of a pregnant mum have released new CCTV footage of a man walking towards her home and running away minutes later.

The force acknowledged speculation that Ms Fauvrelleaposs attacker was known to her, but said we simply are not in a position to say and we must retain an open mind.

So when Zachary leaves for the final time at .pm on July , it will be just as disorientating for her as it is for him, reports Surrey Live.    Linda said: In some ways it will be a relief but I think I will miss it. After  years you get used to the same routine. Her eldest, Rebecca Lamberth, is now  and first joined Holly Lodge in January . Rebecca would become something of a trailblazer for the family with Benjamin Lamberth, , Daniel Lamberth, , Abigail Lamberth, , a son Linda has lost contact with who is , and Naomi Kenton, , all following suit. The remarkable run was nearly broken when there was an almost seven-year age gap between Naomi and Lindaaposs seventh child, Evie Harlow, being born. But due to how their birthdays fall, Evie, who is now , started Reception just as Naomi left Year . Three years later Zachary, , started at Holly Lodge. Getting in and out of the house with one child can be a challenge, so with eight it had to be done with military precision, and the kids were all well trained. I sounded like a stuck record basically, said Linda.Iaposd say aposshoes on the rack, hand mummy your coats, slippers onapos. What my husband [Michael Harlow, ,] loved was seeing all the dferent coloured beakers in the kitchen lined up.    People used to say I looked like a mother duck with all her little ducklings, walking down the road. Linda said she would like £ for every time Iaposve done the walk on the school run and it would earn her a decent sum too.She has walked the half-mile route from her home or the reverse journey a combined total of more than , times. With children in the youngest years having a shorter day, at times she was walking there and back twice in a day. Holly Lodgeaposs current inclusion manager Carol Pedley has known Linda since her son Simon started at the school at the same time as Rebecca Lamberth. Mrs Pedley, , who started working at Holly Lodge in , said it was a bit of a running joke when Linda brought a new child into Reception.She said: It was just a production line. We used to see her walking up and down Vale Road for however many years doing the drop-off and then on to the pre-school. For so many years she was pushing a buggy. Those children came to school on time every day, always immaculately turned out. I donapost know how she did it. Linda has started working as a part-time leguard as she will have a bit more free time when Zachary joins Evie at Ash Manor School.All eight children have also gone to the same secondary school, where Linda is just as familiar a face. She said: Iaposd go for the next induction day [at Ash Manor] and they would be like, aposYou again apos.

The only hope he does have in speaking to Meghan again is arguably his age and his health. Thomas pulled out of the royal wedding just days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, due to a heart condition. Perhaps Meghan will regret not speaking to him or at least opening up a channel of communication againhe was to fall ill. Or maybe just too much damage has been done already. When the sun sets on this saga there are no winners and Meghan must concentrate on the future she can shape for her family and her newborn son.

A pollen bomb has hit following last weekaposs mini-heatwave and counts will remain at dangerously high levels as temperatures rise to C on Thursday and C on Friday. Grass pollen season peaks during the first two weeks of July. More than three million asthma sufferers are at risk of a potentially deadly attack, and they have been advised to stay indoors. For about  million hay fever sufferers, this weekaposs sunny and warm weather could be ruined by symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, runny or blocked noses, or headaches.    The Met Office said Thursdayaposs pollen levels are very high across England and Wales, and high or medium in parts of Scotland. Northern Irelandaposs pollen count is medium. The conditions will affect people in rural areas and cities, where hay fever is made worse by pollution. Temperatures will soar into the mid to high s in southern England and Wales this week with long spells of sunshine for some places. This yearaposs hay fever season started three weeks early thanks to an unusually warm winter that brought record-breaking highs of C in February and spring temperatures that were ten degrees warmer than usual. Tree pollen, which affects one in four hay fever sufferers, was released earlier than usual. The season normally runs from late March to the middle of May. Grass pollen season has two peaks between mid-May and mid-July , and weed pollen season covers the end of June to September. When grass pollen levels are high, more people are admitted to hospital with asthma attacks, said Asthma UK.    About  per cent of people with hay fever are affected by grass pollen. Symptoms include sneezing and coughing, a runny or blocked nose itchy, red or watery eyes, an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears, loss of smell, pain around the temples and forehead, headaches, earaches, and tiredness.Hay fever is a problem for about  per cent of people with asthma. People who suffer from hay fever should avoid alcohol, as it is known to worsen their symptoms. Asthma UK suggests sufferers take their prescribed preventer medicine to soothe irritated airways so they are less likely to react to the pollen trigger. Hay fever medicines such as antihistamines can stop the allergic reaction that triggers asthma symptoms and keep itchy eyes and runny noses at bay. Asthma UK says: Everyone with asthma should keep their blue reliever inhaler with them at all times in case of an emergency.

In the lead up to her Royal Wedding to Prince Harry and in the year since, the Duchess of Sussex has dealt with numerous embarrassing outbreaks from her dad Thomas and sister Samantha. According to insiders her new father-in-law Prince Charles has been a huge source of support during some of the tougher times, which we saw when he offered to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day, and the Queen is also happy with how sheaposs dealt with the drama. A source told the Mirror: “The Queen is very fond of Meghan, as is Charles, and they both believe she has dealt with the situation in a dignied manner.    The whole family is ­sympathetic on how much she has had to deal with.” The heir to the throne has become very protective of his daughter-in-law, who he calls “Tungsten” because she is as “tough and unbending”, and they are understood to spend a lot of time together during family trips. A senior royal source said: “Meghan’s overriding view is that there is no place for her father or his extended family in her le right now. She has a strong family unit around her in Harry, with their ­adorable newborn son, and he has been very, very clear that she only wants ­positive influences for Archie.    “If anything she has developed a strong bond with Harry’s father and has discussed the situation with him. “She definitely sees Charles as a father figure, a principled man who has had his le played out in the public eye. “Despite the desperate pleas from the family, there is zero chance of a ­reconciliation at this stage.    Meghanaposs -year-old father recently used an intermediary to “reach out” to her, however she flatly refused to respond to him, saying she has been “grossly betrayed”, despite other members of the Markle family suggesting she should offer an olive branch. Meghan has had no contact with Thomas since she wrote him a letter in August last year begging him to stop launching hurtful public attacks on her and the Royal Family.

Hannah Bharaj died of ‘catastrophic injuries’ following the fall inside the department store in Cheadle, Stockport, on July  last year.Today an inquest was told that Hannah was a ‘high-achieving perfectionist’ whose le began to ‘unravel’ following the death of two close family members, reports the Manchester Evening News .At the time of her death, the -year-old was a residential patient at the nearby Priory psychiatric hospital seeking treatment for her eating disorder and serious mental health problems.    On the evening of her death, the Birmingham University student was visiting the first floor cafe in John Lewis with her parents Harnovdeep and Sarah. Giving evidence, Mr and Mrs Bharaj told of the horrying moment Hannah, from Bolton, got up from the corner table they shared saying she was going to buy another drink before ‘walking briskly’ to the balcony ft away. Mrs Bharaj said: “We went to the Priory to pick Hannah up at about .pm. We would tend to go to the upstairs cafe in John Lewis because it stayed open later. Hannah had a book with her, I had a crossword. We all had a drink. Then Hannah said she wanted another drink, but she said she fancied a mocha, which was very unusual because of the calories. I gave her £ and she got up and something fell out of her book. It was a card addressed to mum and dad. That made me concerned. She went off to get a drink and when I looked up she didn’t go left to the drinks bit, she went right. I think I knew she was walking towards the balcony. I said ‘Harni, look at the balcony’. I knew then. He leapt up and ran after her. She walked briskly, it was very measured. She stood on a chair then a table then I just saw her legs go down the glass.”    Mr Bharaj added: “I ran towards her. I was about to grab her. She went over. I watched her fall. I couldn’t do anything. I screamed aposplease, anyone call an ambulanceapos.” Mr Bharaj said he believed the fall was a ‘deliberate’ attempt to take her own le. Earlier the inquest had heard how Hannah, a former pupil at Manchester High School for Girls, was a ‘tremendously hard worker’ who could be ‘quite tough on herself’. Her parents said she would set herself ‘very high standards’ and could get ‘very distressed’she didn’t meet her targets. A gymnast, dancer and swimmer, Hannah did ‘fantastically well’ in her GCSEs, and set her sights on a career in medicine, eventually applying to study at Birmingham University. She went on to get an A*, two As and a B at A-level. Initially, the grades weren’t good enough to get on the course, and Hannah ‘considered herself a failure because of the B’, Mrs Bharaj said, but eventually the university did offer her a place. But in her first few weeks in Birmingham Hannah’s grandfather, to whom she was ‘very close’, died. Hannah, who felt the late offer of a university place left her unprepared and was struggling to adapt to le as a student, found the death ‘very dficult’. Mrs Bharaj said: “It was almost like a secret le. She had a good group of friends at university and they would go out socialising but at home she would be very stressed and anxious and just not quite the same.” Hannah began a ‘fanatical’ exercise regime combined with a ‘low calorie high protein’ diet. She became ‘obsessional’ about food, weighing everything she ate and refusing to allow her parents cook for her. Eventually she was consuming just  calories a day, about a third of the recommended intake for an adult woman, and lost a ‘signicant amount of weight’. Mrs Bharaj said: “I think she felt everything in her le was out of control, so the only way to get on top of it was to control everything in a regimented fashion. That was her way of coping with the stress.” During the early stages of her second year at university Hannah was diagnosed with depression and admitted to Oak Trees eating disorder unit on the Wirral with a body mass index of . and was diagnosed with ‘severe anorexia’. Despite being given ‘intensive support’ her weight continued to fall and her depression escalated to the point where she became suicidal and ‘ending her le was her only topic of conversation’. Dr Jessica Morgan, a consultant psychiatrist at the NHS trust which runs Oak Trees, told the inquest Hannah was a ‘high-achieving perfectionist’ who suffered from ‘at least two severe mental illnesses’ and ‘acute grief’.  After six months in the unit Hannah began to show signs of improvement and was allowed tohome. But the inquest heard the death of a second close family member left her ‘absolutely devastated’. Shortly after Hannah attempted to take her own le by taking an overdose of her prescribed medication. She was admitted to an acute psychiatric ward at the Royal Bolton Hospital, before, because of a lack of NHS beds, she was transferred to the Priory, a private clinic in Cheadle. Mr and Mrs Bharaj told the inquest they felt the Priory wasn’t the right place for their daughter to be treated, describing it as ‘quite a scary place’ where Hannah ‘didn’t have the support she had at Oak Trees’. The inquest is expected to last for four days. Representatives from the Priory, John Lewis and the NHS are expected to give evidence.

Not Coco Gauff. The -year-old reacted to her win with grace and charm, just like the defeated Venus Williams. And between them, they provided the best news of the week. We watch sport for the stories. Coco was the youngest player to qualy for the event since . Venus was the oldest woman in the draw. Youthful enthusiasm took on a woman of experience, and won in straight sets. Coco – real name Cori – was also a wildcard, just like a -year-old Boris Becker back in . Who could forget him vaulting over the Centre Court net after clinching the championship  It was a joy to hear people chant “Boris! Boris!” then. Not so much today. But most importantly, Coco was playing a woman she’d looked up to since Venus inspired her to pick up a racket aged seven. To compete against what you worship is hard, to win astounding – and Coco managed it for one simple reason. Over years of coaching she learned to focus like Venus and her sister Serena, whose picture was on her bedroom wall, urging her on. She trained, studied, suffered, strived, to be like them. And then she went on to Court One, brought her own game, and won.    Every strand of the story in that match is inspiring, but none more so than the power of having a good role model. Whether it’s Venus, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, or Ellen White, an adult who, win or lose, plays a good game gives youngsters a space they can grow into, and then grow out of. It’s like parenting, in a way, but on a grander, better-paid, and less-forgiving scale. Parents are always flawed, because we see them up close. An idol is distant and perfect, which is why the public get so disgusted when other pictures on bedroom walls turn out to include adulterers, gamblers, or tax dodgers. Venus Williams has known for  years the responsibility of being so admired. Perhaps that’s why after losing to Coco she made a brief appearance for the cameras to congratulate her, before retiring to punch the wall in private.    One of my idols was a chief reporter on my first local paper. She taught me how to handle death knocks, sub editors and Fleet Street drinking games. Another was my gran, who railed at Tories after Sunday lunch and baked stonking cakes. I remember being , desperate to have a purpose, and adulthood, and the ability to have a crack at all these things. They taught me how, just like Venus did Coco. Idols matter. Applaud Coco for finding her purpose, and applaud Venus for delivering it.

Cameron Gallagher was set to jet home from his holiday to Cypriot party resort when he realised heaposd lost the crucial documentation. The -year-oldaposs week-long dream trip turned into disaster, reports the Daily Record. Cameron, from Kilmarnock, realised his passport had vanished at the island’s airport last Wednesday morning. Cameron’s  pals, some of them in tears, all headed home without him and to add insult to injury, a case mix-up at the airport meant the only clothes he had left to wear belonged to his friends while his own luggage made it back to Glasgow.    The former St Joseph’s Academy pupil has been pleading with authorities to let him go home but a series of hold-ups have trapped him in the party island that more than , sun-seekers flock to each year. “It’s been a bit horrible and frustrating to say the least,” Cameron said. “I was  minutes away from boarding the flight and realised that I didn’t have my passport on me and I was running round the airport like mad trying to find it but I couldn’t. “It was a heart in the mouth moment, and I didn’t really know what to do. “By that time everyone was on the plane so I told my friends to go and board the plane and leave me. “I still haven’t found my passport but I’m always losing things.”    Cameron was up for around  hours while trying to find a way home and took an hour-long bus ride to the British Embassy. Officials told him that it would take two working days to cobble together emergency travel documents but the embassy is closed on weekends. Speaking from the island earlier this week, Cameron said that the authorities said his temporary passport was ready on Monday, but couldn’t be collected until Tuesday. “The British Embassy has been shut over the weekend so it’s been a bit of a nightmare,” Cameron said. “I stayed in the town of Larnaca, where the airport is, for the first few nights and then went back to Ayia Napa for a night. But I’m now back in Larnaca. “I’ve been lucky because my parents have sent me some money to tide me over. “I haven’t even enjoyed being out on my own, I’ve just been sitting watching movies in my hotel. I get really bored easily.” And Cameron is now desperate to get back home to resume his summer job teaching English to kids at St Andrew’s College Language School, which he’s held down for three summers now. “I really want to get back because I was meant to start my summer job on Saturday and I don’t want to let them down. “My work have been great and really understanding of the situation though. “First time I spoke to my parents, my mum called me an idiot but they’re now as frustrated as I am and just want me home.” Cameron is  hopeful of getting home today by flying to London Heathrow and on to Glasgow. Last year, the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeissued emergency travel documents to over , Brits who were abroad. Officials say that it takes around two working days to issue an emergency travel document. An FCO spokesman said: “We have provided assistance by issuing emergency travel documents to a British man in Cyprus who had lost his passport.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tributes beautiful talented teen who","story":"NewsTributes to beautul and talented -year-old who died from cardiac arrestMischa Allan, , from Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, suffered a cardiac arrest and died in hospital surrounded by her familyShareCommentsByAmanda Keenan:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsOne friend described Mischa as the most lovely and caring person I’ve met \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA teenage girl who died days after collapsing at home has been described as “beautul and talented” as grief-stricken friends come to terms with her death.

The heat will steadily increase this week as temperatures rise from highs of C today to C tomorrow and C on Friday. The mercury will be fairly high across the country today, with most of the country experiencing temperatures in the late teens to early s. While tomorrow will be hotter in the south of the UK, it will be a milder day for Scotland, which will likely be hit by rain. Most of of Wales, central, north-west, east, north-east, south, south-east and south-west England will bask in sunshine today, with similar conditions tomorrow. Friday should be even sunnier, although there will be cloud and potentially rain in Scotland and north-west England.    Meteorologists reported recorded the Earthaposs hottest June on record last month, with Europe coming to a standstill during an unprecedented heatwave last week. The EUaposs satellite agency reported June was the warmest on record, with average European temperatures C higher than normal. Climate change made the European heatwave last week at least five times as likely to happen, analysis suggests. Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the environmental change institute at the University of Oxford and one of the experts behind the analysis, said: This is a strong reminder again, that climate change is happening here and now. It is not a problem for our kids only.  Both observations and models show a strong trend towards stronger heatwaves. However, the observed trend is stronger than the modelled one, and we do not yet know why. Temperatures observations suggest the kind of extreme heat seen last week has become at least  times, and potentially  times, more likely since , analysis from the World Weather Attribution group found. But the scientists said other factors were at play which affect temperatures, along with climate change, such as changes to land use, air pollution and irrigation. The Met Office said the UK was spared the scorching temperatures seen in parts of Europe as a result of an undercut of cooler air coming in from the North Sea. A netweather.tv spokesman said: The UK managed to escape the most extreme heat thanks to an easterly wind off the North Sea, which is still relatively cool at this time of year. Even so, a top June temperature of .C at Heathrow and Northolt occurred on Saturday  June. Not far off the all time June record of .C. Without that undercut of less hot air, the record would have fallen in the stling air from the south.  Despite the heat, Britain saw widespread flooding in June, with over a monthaposs worth of rainfall falling in some areas in less than  hours. The worst of the weather hit Lincolnshire, south-east England and parts of Wales and Scotland. The Met Office even issued a danger to le warning as a result of the fast flowing floodwater in some parts of the country.

In June, the Government said it would issue a recall notice of up to , dryers which are a fire risk. But when pressed by MPs yesterday, company chiefs admitted the number of unmodied machines could be much higher. Whirlpool also revealed, in recent years, it had logged  fires in its dryers and admitted three of those were models that had been updated. Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, said it had seen a wide range of faults causing fires in machines which had already been modied.    MPs were taking evidence over the scandal that has seen . million products modied so far. Witness Jemma Spurr, whose modied dryer caught fire, told the Business Committee she was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Whirlpool bosses were asked by MP Antoinette Sandbach why some victims were asked to sign NDAs, when the company had stated it wanted to raise awareness of the issue.She said: “Why is it that you are trying to shut people up by asking them to sign NDAs ”    Jeff Noel, from Whirlpool, defended their use, saying they are an “important part” of any settlement. He was also asked about the Grenfell fire and whether the firm stood by its statement the blaze may have been caused by a cigarette. An expert told a public inquiry it probably started in a Whirlpool Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Mr Noel said: “I’m not in a position to say anything other than I think it’s appropriate for issues to have been raised.” Five million dryers had a fault that allows fluff to touch the heating element and has caused at least  fires. The Creda and Hotpoint brands are also affected.

Looking back on it, it was pure hell. A nightmare no child should have to endure. My mother used to weigh me, she would make me strip off my clothing and step on the scale.

Luke Freeman, , from Reading, Berks, died instantly after falling from tourist apartments in the Costa Brava resort of Lloret de Mar just before .am yesterday morning. Police are treating the tragedy as an accident after concluding that he lost his balance and toppled over the balcony after a night out with friends. He was staying at Apartamentos Trimar in the centre of Lloret but had gone back to another block with six friends who had checked in a week earlier.    They were due toto the UK late yesterday after giving statements to police. Close friend Jack Luttman, also from Reading, said: “Words can’t explain how devastated I am. “Luke Freeman, you were like a brother to me and I’ll always love you man. “Rest easy bro. Thank you for all the memories you have given me since the age of six. You were truly a legend. “And you have no idea how much you will be missed by me and everyone who knew you.

All it took was a request and the work was done in time for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day on June .Geordie Rhodick, chairman, LAFDSirFor the past two years, since he was elected to Argyll and Bute Council by the skin of his teeth, Councillor Alastair Redman has bombarded local newspapers with a constant stream of drivel attacking the Scottish Government.In his latest diatribe, he alleges that #the SNP has completely misjudged the mood of voters up and down the country#.I know it will be extremely painful for him, buthe can bring himself to review last week’s European Election results in Scotland, he’ll see the complete fallacy of this statement, andhe wants to look even closer to home, he’ll see that the SNP polled , votes in Argyll and Bute – , votes ahead of the Tories who came a distant fourth.Hardly a sign of his mythical assertion that Ruth Davidson is poised to be the next First Minister of Scotland.Robert Macintyre, Serpentine Road, RothesayDear PaulI write on behalf of constituents in Tarbert regarding the application for the Inveraray to Crossaig kV overhead line, which is with the [Scottish Government] Energy Consents Unit.A very large number of constituents have contacted me regarding this matter and almost  have signed a petition.They believe the proposal will have a major deleterious effect on the village and will be a huge and ugly blot on the landscape which, given the very attractive and scenic nature of the area, will be a big disincentive to tourism and will spoil the enjoyment of the area for residents as well.I have met with SSE to discuss this issue and have made it clear to them that the community wishes the company to come forward with alternative proposals, which must include undergrounding the cableno route can be found which does not spoil the visual amenity of the village.I know that the new line is needed for entirely understandable and positive reasons, and I have had only a few complaints from other parts of the area which will be affected.The opposition in Tarbert is virtually unanimous and there is also concern being expressed from those who know and value the area but do not live there.I hope that any consideration of consent will ensure that this issue is dealt with in accordance with the views of local people and I would be grateful to hear from you what the timescale is for that decision .Michael RussellSir,Newly-elected UK MEPs will take their seats in the European Parliament in July and it is crucial they recognise their signicant role in shaping the policies that impact on farming businesses. This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have. We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"dementia week recognised in lochgilphead","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAlzheimer Scotland is holding some informative activities in Lochgilphead to help spread awareness and aid on dementia for Dementia Awareness Week.Representatives from Alzheimer Scotland will be in Lochgilphead Library offering advice on dementia on Wednesday June  from pm to pm and Friday June  from am to pm.Dementia Awareness Week takes place from Monday June  to Sunday June  and will this year focus on dementia research and support.Alzheimer Scotland#s messages for this year#s awareness campaign are:dementia research is crucial to making a dference for people living with dementia now, and in the futuredementia research can only take place with the help of volunteers who have dementia and those who do notto make sure that we can learn more about dementia prevention and improving quality of le, in our journey to ultimately finding a cureit is vital that people living with dementia feel recognised, valued and supported in their local communities to prevent isolation and stigmaand that Alzheimer Scotland provides a wide range of dementia-specic support, delivered through our localities in the heart of communities across Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray senior citizens gain culture at kelvingrove","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens Club had its annual bus outing this month.This year members travelled to the much-loved Kelvingrove Art Gallery in Glasgow on Wednesday May .The first stop was to The Loch Lomond Arms Hotel in Luss for a morning coffee stop, then on to Kelvingrove in time for the pm organ recital and a look round the exhibits.The trip was rounded off with a stop at the Stables Restaurant in Balloch for high tea and thenhome."},{"url":null,"title":"the easy club is taking the show on the road","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Easy Club is taking to the streets of Mid Argyll this summer to spread its musical message of ersity and inclusion –  although they will have a Plan B in place should the weather disagree.Club members will play by the Baptist Church, Lochgilphead, from pm to pm on Saturday June , then Ardrishaig by the Kelpies in Pier Square, from pm to pm on Saturday July .The club will also hit the Stag Hotel in Lochgilphead, either just before or just after early one evening.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger.

The highlight of their day was to excavate the soil in their trench and the children enjoyed ‘trowelling’ the soil, then sieving their excavated soil checking for any objects that may have escaped their eye.Finally, at the end of the dig sessions, the pupils gathered round to examine the objects no matter how big or small, they had each found on the day.

reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new

The school has reported to the parent council that the noise levels in the library has at times been disruptive to other library users and to nearby classes, and excessive litter has been left in the library.ldquoDespite a self-service system that is aimed to be straightforward to operate, books are not finding their way to their correct place in the library once they have been ed.ldquoS pupils have been tasked throughout the year to keep the library running, but they also have their own studies and other activities that they volunteer for.ldquoThe former library service provision has in effect been replaced with a service run by pupils with little or no training, who should not be left to police their peers.ldquoThe perception is that this is merely another cost-cutting exercise by Scottish Borders council with little or no obvious benefit to the pupils.ldquoThis experience has been similar in Eyemouth, in the memberrsquos own ward, and has been backed up by a detailed letter from the chair of Eyemouth Parent Council sent to her and other councillors.ldquoThis backs up the experiences at Galashiels Academy. Dare I say it, there appears to have been a lack of lsquoinspired learningrsquo in this process.ldquoSurely you must agree that it is time to abandon this ill-conceived pilot and get our school libraries back to being fully al centres for study and learning for the benefit of our pupils.In response, councillor Hamilton acknowledged that there are issues with the scheme at Galashiels Academy: ldquoLast night I went to Galashiels to watch their production of High School Musical and I did speak to the parent chair, and I am aware of the issues and we are addressing them.ldquoThere are still a report to come about the libraries and wersquore having to look at each library as each library is dferent in terms of its layout, and the building.ldquoSome schools are looking a dferent service from their schools sothere is anything further Irsquoll come back to you."},{"url":null,"title":"roads-firm-to-rewrite-signs-following-tourist-u-turns","story":"CONTRACTORS behind a closed road near the Grey Mares Tail have been forced to rewrite their signs.Because of Openreach cabling being laid near Moffat, the A road to Selkirk is closed in both directions for  days.The daytime closures, between am and pm, started this week.And businesses in the Yarrow Valley have already reported a major downturn in trade.Although the closure on the Dumfries and Galloway side of the local authority boundary was expected to lead to a drop in visitors from the south-west, misleading signs from the other end of the road have hurt retailers and hoteliers further.Closure signs placed in Selkirk, Traquair, Innerleithen, Tweedsmuir and at other minor roads leading onto the A dont indicate where the road is closed.And, according to business owners in the valley, many tourists are performing u-turns rather than making their ways up to the scenic St Marys Loch.On Monday morning, the Glen Cafe next to St Marys Loch had only served a handful of customers.At the nearby Gordon Arms staff were also twiddling their thumbs.Susan Cree from the Gordon Arms told us: \"I went into Selkirk to see what the signs said and during the time I stopped there were two camper vans pulling up at the sign and about to turn around.\"They only continued up the valley after I told them where the road was closed.\"Weve already had cancellations from people who were intending travelling from the Moffat side, and we are a lot quieter today than we would normally be.\"We appreciate that things have to get done but this is our busiest time of the year -

Inclusive Growth Deal.The deal is seeking to attract tourists to the area and boost business, and is the result of collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up

said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous

planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys-sees-sales-tumble-further-amid-tough-supermarket-environment","story":"Sainsburyrsquos has seen like-for-like sales continue to tumble over the past four months, as pressure continues to weigh down on boss Mike Coupe.Mr Coupe is expected to face criticism from some investors at the supermarketrsquos annual general meeting on Thursday, following the collapse of its planned mega-merger with Asda earlier this year.The retailer saw like-for-like sales decline by .% in the  weeks to June , as its decline accelerated from .% in the previous quarter.--vw,vw,px, px\"--Total retail sales excluding fuel fell by .% during the period, as the company said it was impacted by a ldquotough retail environment.Grocery sales declined by .% over the period, as the decline in sales slowed down from .% in the previous period.Sainsburyrsquos also reported sales slumps of .% and .% respectively for its general merchandise and clothing isions.The sales figures come just months after the competition watchdog, the CMA, blocked Sainsburyrsquos from joining forces with fellow ldquoBig Four supermarket Asda.Wersquove blocked the Sainsburyrsquos   Asda merger after finding that it would lead to:# Higher prices for groceries and fuel# Less choice and worse quality of products## A poor shopping experienceRead more: https:t.co FrOpssqwSpic lJQtkBbeCmdash Competition  Markets AuthorityApril , Sainsburyrsquos has tried to win over shoppers in recent months by lowering prices, with reductions on more than , food and grocery items.The supermarket said it has also committed to reduce its net debt by at least pound million over the next three years.It has also outlined signicant store investment which will make improvements in  stores nationwide.Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsburyrsquos, said: ldquoWe continue to adapt our business to changing shopping habits and made good progress in a challenging market.ldquoWe reduced prices on over , everyday food and grocery products and improved our relative performance.ldquoIn a tough trading environment, we gained market share in key general merchandise categoriesand in clothing, where we are now the UKrsquos fth largest retailerby volume..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Sainsbury us sees sales tumble further amid  utough u supermarket environment"},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities. We then refine our idea, seeking feedback from people in Prestonpans. Then we follow the commercial path of least resistance, working with East Lothian Council and other bodies. We bootstrap the idea ASAP with initial funding needed to install the equipment, secure and manage the premise. Then we use the success of the venue to fundraise for improvements and enhancements to the structure of the building to renovate the interior.Brian Weddell, chair of the community council, said: ldquoI was delighted that the feedback from community council members was  per cent positive.ldquoIt is an exciting and imaginative use of a grossly under-used community asset that could help kickstart the revitalisation of Prestonpans High Street.The Town Hall was identied as one of the six viable properties across the county suitable for a CAT, offering local organisations the chance to lease or buy them."},{"url":null,"title":"work-on-affordable-homes-at-letham-mains-haddington-under-way","story":"In total,  new council houses and a further  housing association homes are being built at the Letham Mains site, off the B near Oaktree Junction.The site has a number of dferent developers currently at ious stages of construction as more than  new homes are planed alongside a new primary school on the land.East Lothian Council said that the work on the affordable housing, which was recently awarded to Hart Builders with a total cost of pound.million, was now under way.The homes are expected to be completed in phases between spring and autumn next year, with three more affordable developments expected to start on the Letham Mains site in future years.Councillor Jim Goodfellow, the councilrsquos cabinet spokesperson for housing, said: ldquoThis is great news for current and future residents of East Lothian.ldquoThere is a clear need for new affordable housing developments and these sites at Letham Mains will help contribute to meeting our local housing strategy outcomes by increasing the supply of affordable housing and improving access across dferent tenures and house types.The new Castle Rock Edin will take ownership of the  housing association homes being built on the site.Richard Jennings, the associationrsquos managing director, said: ldquoThere is strong demand for mid-market rent accommodation in East Lothian and we are delighted to deliver an affordable choice of high-quality, well-managed homes for people wishing to be part of the vibrant new community at Letham Mains."},{"url":null,"title":"preview-3-harbours-festival","story":"Residents and visitors alike can enjoy art galleries, live music events, family afternoons with pebble decorating and ukulele orchestras, open houses, cooking demonstrations and workshops over the course of the festival, which runs from Saturday to next Sunday .The festival, which was started more than  years ago, is going from strength to strength, expanding and becoming more erse, with something for everyone in its programme.For the live music fans out there, there is a chance to see the Tom Fairnie Band play their famous Americana music supported by Paul Brown, then Andy Brown, Dropkick and Fuzzystar for the Indie lovers, Alex Hodgson and Rhys Heaven for the folk fans, and to get an eclectic mix all in one sitting, there are the Live on the Lawn sessions, an afternoon of music in the majestic Cockenzie House and Gardens .To keep the young ones and old ones entertained all at once, this year will see a Harbour Family Afternoon added to the programme.

It provides a superb vertical foil to the horizontal expanse of the beautul little town, or Royal Burgh of Inveraray. From the top of the tower, the views can be magnicent, sweeping from the Arrochar Alps, Beinn Ime and the Cobbler above the head of the loch, down to the Firth of Clyde and the western hills of Kintyre. From above, the shape of the geological pressures that created Scotland are laid out impressively. At the foot of the Tower, lies the th century planned Royal Burgh.Climb the Tower , look around, and down. On the way up, visit the bells themselves, fitted like a jig-saw into the space, and see the video display of the bells ringing - an almost frightening sight! On the ground floor is an exhibition of Argyll in the First World War.The Tower has a poignant history. It was conceived and built by the th Duke of Argyll, Duke Niall Diarmid, as a memorial to the dead of the First World War, in particular to the Campbells and the ldquomen of my lands. It was an act of personal piety. Ten bells were commissioned from John Taylor and Company of Loughborough. The ten were cast as a single perfectly matched suite. The Scottish Association of Change-Ringers keeps them perfectly timed, and as the second heaviest set of  bells in the UK, they are known and visited by campanologists from around the world, particularly at the bell-ringing festival . Bells traditionally have names, and these bells are named for the ancient Celtic saints who inhabited the boundaries of the Dukersquos possessions: Moluag, Columba, Mund, Brendan, Maelrubha, Blaan, Murdouch, Brigid, Molaise, and Our LadyStella Maris.The Bells were cast in . First they had to reach Inveraray. The first lorry carrying them broke down in Lancashire. Then the second lorry proved unable to climb the Rest and Be Thankful - like so many other visitors before and after. Two bells and the frame had to be dumped and rescued the next day.Then the Tower had to be built. The Duke taxed all his friends and visitors for money. The facing stone came from the quarry in Furnace during winters, the Duke himself collected rubble in his wheel-barrow for the interior of the fabric. The tower was begun in , and finished  years later in , and the bells hung. The cost was just over pound,, approximately pound million in todayrsquos money. The bells could be heard in St Catherinersquos, across the loch.Before long, the tower was struck by lightning, and with the Second World War, ringing ceased. The Tower became almost ruinous. After the war, Lady Glenkinglas founded the Friends of Inveraray Bell-Tower, and gradually restored the Tower to safety, from where the bells ring proudly today during the summer months for visiting bands.The House of Argyll traditionally belonged to the Presbyterian party, with its strong links to the Hanoverian monarchy. In the s the then Duke married an Anglican Duchess, and built the church of All Saints for the Scottish Episcopal Church.

I know nothing of the Queenrsquos soul. I can neither judge her good or bad, but I accept many see her as a person of moral standing. However, the character of Elizabeth Windsor is meaningless in any debate about monarchy.The institution of monarchy should have been buried decades,not centuries, ago. Like the death penalty or denying votes to women or jailing people for who they have sex with, the idea that a person has a hereditary right to rule stands in opposition to every principle of modernity.What slaves it makes us to accept this state of affairs. This isnrsquot a call for some Robespierre revolution. Britain ndash England in particular ndash has been sucking on the crack-pipe of royalty for too long to be weaned off any time soon. Whatrsquos needed though is an intelligent ongoing conversation which challenges the accepted wisdom that monarchy is a good thing when it clearly isnrsquot.The time is ripe for that debate. It may be an ugly thing to say but the Queenrsquos age makes the discussion pertinent. Even Republicans like me accept that the monarchy is safe as long as she lives. However, the entire fabulation ndash every palace and power, every penny and privilege ndash needs to be put to the test before her Crown passes on.I struggle to find one argument to sustain monarchy. People cite tradition. It used to be traditional to burn witches. The traditions of this country have served us badly. Britain clings to the past like a drowning sailor ndashthe country hadnrsquot been so obsessed with the war, the flag, and the Royals, we might have seen clearer and avoided the red, white and blue disaster thatrsquos Brexit.

We take a handful of people and elevate them, gting them gilded lives, while at the same time the UN describes the poverty in Britain as tragic and systematic.

A child has power and prestige heaped upon it in the cradle ndash like gts from fairy godmothers ndash even it that child should grow up to be intellectually or morally inferior to many of the rest of us. Monarchy murders meritocracy.Social mobility barely exists in the UK. The top professions are dominated by public schools and Oxbridge. No wonder. The monarchy effectively codies inequality in law. Britain remains a country of the one per cent, and the Queen is the great symbol for that class-ridden stratication of society.Meghan and Harry have spent millions in public funds doing up their already free home, Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The final bill is expected to be pound.m. It will be the perfect home for their baby. There was a headline in one of the glossy magazines recently which read \"Why the Royals canrsquot stop giggling\". It had lots of pictures of Harry and William and all the rest of them laughing. I couldnrsquot help but think, theyrsquore laughing at us.Amid all the squandering of money on these people, it feels redundant to make the point that there are working families unable to pay their mortgages across the land, and jobless families struggling to clothe and feed themselves. Yet, the British doff their cap, and donrsquot bat an eyelid.The philosopher Thomas Paine said \"a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right and raises at first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.\"Britain, with its stubborn anti-intellectualism and ingrained deference, has refrained from critical thinking about the royals. One moment spent in true thought about monarchy and what the institution says about Britain, what it symbolises within our society, and the entire edice would logically come tumbling down. Monarchy is incompatible with equality.There was one person who dared to hint that the emperor had no clothes, though. When the Queen came north, Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Greens, refrained from the usual obsequiousness, dropped the phrase Your Majesty from his address to Holyrood and simply referred to the Queen and the rest of the audience as Friends. Mr Harvie also stated that itrsquos the people of Scotland who are sovereign ndash no-one .That simple levelling ndash of bringing the Queen down to the same status as the rest of us ndash was an important act which quietly and politely said: \"not everyone accepts this grotesquerie\".Britain is locked on a path of seismic and inevitable constitutional change and the royals will have to change with the times. Britain may soon be a rump state, with a unied Ireland to the west, an independent Scotland to the north, and a lost Europe across the channel. The Queen may find herself ruling over a very little England indeed.

Indeed both candidates threw in poundbn for post-Brexit agriculture and fisheries.By now, the adults in the Tory poker room were beginning to fret. Spoilsport Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that theyd spent his ldquopoundbn fiscal headroom many times over.

The IFS Director, Paul Johnson, pointed out that the poundbn was available for one year only.And Brexit  Well, Jeremy Hunts response to the Chancellors strictures was to toss in another poundbn to compensate industries hit by Brexit tarfs The IFS believe the cost of Brexit will be vastly greater than that.

Scuttlebutt insists that the -year-old is nothing but a puppet, leaning on colleagues for support, mouthing their ideas, and too decrepit to do much more than clutch the lectern and issue an occasional rallying call to his troops.With most unfrail alacrity, Mr Corbyn has refuted all these suggestions ndash apparently made by senior civil servants ndash and is asking for an independent inquiry into whoever is spreading such lies. He is right to insist on this, but sadly the damage is already done. Now every blink and tremor, every hesitation and stumble, will be cause for analysis and concern.No-one beyond the Labour leaderrsquos closest family and associates can know how much,any, truth this gossip holds. Wersquove been told about eye problems, but are they an indication of more serious underlying health problems  Or is it simply that the burdens of office are exhausting him, making him appear older than his years  Impossible to tell. With a man whose demeanour has always been more energy-saving bulb than dynamo, it is dficult to detect any appreciable dimming of wattage.As questions were being asked about his ability to run the party, let alone turn the key in the door of Number , I found myself thinking of Mr Corbyn when watching democratic hopefuls for the next US presidential nomination. Bernie Saunders, who will be  in September, is impressively impassioned, but he cannot surely be anybodyrsquos idea of the perfect candidate, given the demands that would be made of him in arguably the most high-profile and pressured job in the world.

New Zealand accents!\"Nailed itOUR stories of lunches in workplace fridges helped Russel Martin in Bearsden recall: \"When I was an apprentice in a Clydeside marine engineering works, refrigerated storage facilities for lunchtime food were not a concept. Lunchtime pieces or chits as they were known, were often taken to work in a small tin. It was unwise to leave these lying around unattended. The more mischievous of the apprentices would remove the contents and drive a six-inch nail through the bottom and into the wooden work bench, before replacing everything.

Apologising to him, I said Id put it in the bin, but he said he could still use it. I pointed out that the egg was now actually full of small bits of dirt and grit but he said itll be ok as theyll just think its pepper. We used the egg without any complaints.\"What a tailUSING Airbnb to stay in someones spare room is a great way to travel, but it can lead to misunderstandings. One woman traveller who had booked a room received the text message before she arrived stating: \"I apologise in advance. But Kevin may try to sleep with you.

This went on until he phoned one extremely attractive lady parishioner, and when she asked who was calling, he replied that he had visited her, dined with her and even danced with her. Not having a clue who he was she asked, Have you slept with me  After that scenario he changed his telephone approach.\"Flight of fancyGREAT to see all the brides in their vintage cars just now, although we didnt realise how complicated some weddings have become.

You might remember what happened: the house went up for sale in  and it looked like the estate would be broken up. The Chippendale furniture would be sold and the house emptied, and weather, vandals and entropy would be left to do the rest.:Neil Mackay: We need to start talking about the abolition of the monarchyHowever, thatrsquos not what happened, thank God: the consortium led by the prince was successful in buying the house and, in the years since, it has spent many millions in renovating the buildings and the estate. But itrsquos the effects in the wider community that are particularly striking ndash effects Irsquove seen for myself as someone who lives nearby.Our local swimming pool was on the point of being closed for example. The Princersquos foundation renovated it and saved it. The same with our once decrepit town hall. I was there on the day it reopened and I listened to Prince Charles talk about why he got involved. Dumfries House had a special place in his affections, he told us, but he also wanted to do what he could for the people of Ayrshire.And he has. Partly, itrsquos been through some of the softer benefits Dumfries House has brought, such as a new book festival and classes for local children on food and farming. But there have been hard benefits too, such as new jobs. In fact, you may have read the testimony of some of the people whorsquove benefited in this way when The Herald featured their stories the other day.People like Graeme Bone, who took a course in one of the training centres at Dumfries House and now works on upcycling factory offcuts to make bags. ldquoItrsquos hard not to be inspired here, he said. Or Kris Muir, who used to be unemployed but is now a gardener on the estate. ldquoThis place has lted New Cumnock, he said.There are lots of other people like Mr Bone and Mr Muir in the villages around Dumfries House ndash in fact, the estate is now the second biggest employer in the county ndash and I think their stories matter because they undermine one of the traditional arguments of republicans, which is that the Royal Family costs too much. It sometimes seems like British citizens who take this viewwould apply a kind of reverse austerity to the country, stripping it of everything that glitters and leaving only the useful and the utilitarian they would reduce it all to figures that can be balanced on a spread sheet. Perhaps they could print it out and take it down the Mall in a horse and carriage and see what kind of reaction it gets.However, the truth is the Royal Family is more complicated, and wonderful, than that. I know that some royalists talk about the benefits to tourism but Irsquove never been entirely convinced by that argument ndash who can say how many visitors come because we have princesses and dukes  I would point out, instead, that the monarchy costs less than a pound per person per year, but more importantly I would point to the bag-maker Graeme Bone and the gardener Kris Muir and the thousands of others like them who live near me. Their lives have been improved by the influence of the Prince of Wales and the investment and attention he attracts.And anyway, money is never what really matters in the end is it, even with the royals  The other day, Prince William did the most extraordinary thing: he told young members of an LGBTQ group that he would be fine with any of his children being gay. It reminded me of the moment his mother put aside the prejudice of the s and shook the hand of an Aids patient without her gloves. It demonstrates, then and now, that an institution that is accused of being behind the times is often ahead of them.:Mark Smith: A new secret weapon in the fight against Scottish nationalism: the pamphlet of loveThink about this too: the Royal Family does cost a lot of money ndash in  , pound million ndash but so would the paraphernalia and pomp of its replacement: a president or head of state. And we need to think carefully about what we want to spend that kind of money on: a monarch who, in the age of populism, has an approval rating of some  per cent, or some of the alternatives Sadly, you know what they are: the Scottish nationalist in Bute House or the British nationalist whorsquos about to be in Number . Some people think those two would be value for money. I would rather spend my pound per year on something better."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-english-nationalism-demeans-our-politics","story":"English nationalism is not mentioned in Mr Smithrsquos column, but it is arguably the element which has driven Brexit and left the country in its present state of lemming-like idiocy. Is it not noticed by media commentators, because it has become so normalised and taken for granted  It does appear to be a signicant mote in Mr Smithrsquos eye and it greatly diminishes his arguments for a better style of politics.Dr Angus Macmillan, Dumfries.IT is a lovely idea that a kinder politics could flourish in Scotland rather than that which we have become accustomed to. Mark Smith points out that the remarkable victory of Ekrem Imamoglu as mayor of Istanbul was based on just such a strategy, having concluded that ldquoyou cannot fight polarising populists by being polarising.Those who have become hardened by the angry confrontation that so often accompanies exchanges over Scotlandrsquos constitutional future might think it naiumlve to imagine that we could get away from all that rancour, yet the Istanbul example shows otherwise. Turkish politics has after all suffered more than its fair share of isive and angry political struggles over the years.Personally, I believe one of the biggest turn-offs when it comes to considering future options for Scotland is the grievance-led narrative favoured by the SNP leadership. The challenge for those who value Scotlandrsquos positive place in the UK is to try to dfuse discord, and to emphasise the positives we share with family, friends, colleagues and fellow citizens across the UK. Many of the dferences that nationalists seek to exploit are short-term or exaggerated, whereas the advantages of being in the closest of possible unions have lasted over the course of many generations.Keith Howell, West Linton.RORY Stewart was right to be ldquoafraid of the word ldquolove in political discourse. All you need is love, said the Beatles, and that ended in an acid trip at Haight-Ashbury. Mark Smith seems to regard love as a political tool that might be utilised so that ldquowe might be able to take on popular movements that rely on national identity, such as Scottish nationalism. His particular brand of love does not seem to be universal. Who are ldquowe Tricky word, love. Professor William Barclay used to lecture us on prime-time telly, to the signature tune of Mendelssohnrsquos Scottish Symphony, on the dference between ldquoeros and ldquoagape . The trouble is that a lot of people who think they are in love are actually in a relationship of coercive abuse. The greatest act of love you can possibly bestow on a person about whom you are crazy, but who just isnrsquot right for you, is to let her go.Dr Hamish Maclaren, Stirling.MARK Smith comments on the positive nature of ldquolove in the political sphere. What he doesnrsquot say is the first proponent of inclusive political positivity was Alex Salmond in the  referendum, and who always referred to our big southern neighbour with complementary affection. Of course his objective was Scottish self-government and his opponent was Anglo-British nationalism, the nationalism seldom referenced in the media. The term ldquoUnionist, in the time of Brexit surely being an oxymoron, and certainly contrary to majority opinion within the Tory Party.Mr Salmond gained nothing for his positivity, being told a Scottish English border would be ldquocustom posts, barbed wire, and armed guards: contrast that with the proposed ldquoinvisible border in Ireland. Or Scotland being rebuffed on a currency union, oddly this is now cast as the ldquoSNP ditching the pound by todays British nationalists.And there is not much love coming from the Tory leadership contest. What we are told by the contestants is that Scotland will not be ldquoallowed to be independent: that while border polls in Northern Ireland are guaranteed by international treaty , that winning elections with a Scottish electorate, or gaining a majority in Scotlandrsquos parliament is not ldquoa mandate for a plebiscite.GR Weir, Ochiltree.I NOTE with wry amusement the ambitions of Jo Swinson, prospective Liberal Democrat UK Leader .Ms Swinson will have no truck with the SNP or an independence referendum she hopes for a Liberal Democrat government after Brexit. Again we read about the LibDems breaking the mould of British politics, something they have forecast every time they make a small advance. The mould of British politics was well and truly broken by the Brexit Party in this yearrsquos European election  seats, with the LibDems on . I might also point out that the Tories got four and Labour .Two things she hinted at: she is not completely against co-operation with the Tories, despite their previous alliance with that party destroying any credibility the LibDems had. And her ambition to be Prime Minister would be dunted by the fact that there is a thing called English Votes for English Laws which could debar her from any Cabinet office on that score I am constantly surprised at the survival of David Mundell.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amSerco NorthLink Ferries has partnered with one of Scotland’s digital start-ups to improve journeys for customers who require additional support.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course. Ongoing funding will be needed to support the work of the local management group and allow coordination to take place.#The minister agreed to look at ways in which this might be achieved and to come back with more detailed thoughts in due course.“I am encouraged by the developments today but also determined to make sure that this now translates into effective action to address what has been a long-running issue affecting Orkney’s farming community”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

One of the new measures is a study looking at how the birds# numbers could be brought down to .SNH have committed to supporting egg oiling and corralling activities, with an expert in corralling geese to visit the county to advise farmers on how this could be used and training for egg oiling being made available.Contractors will also be funded to carry out egg oiling at specic areas next season.As mentioned, a study will also be carried out to create an Orkney-wide plan to reduce geese numbers. According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney. Working closely with the local goose management group, we have committed to measures that will help protect crops, while still maintaining the balance between conservation, farming and hunting.”News of support for these measures also followed an announcement earlier in the week that the sale of goose meat and funding have been extended in Orkney and the Western Isles, until the end of .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

No violence is acceptable but HK people MUST preserve right topeaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showedtoday.mdash Jeremy HuntJuly , He said the authorities need to ldquounderstand the root causes of what happened, which is a deep-seated concern by people in Hong Kong that their basic freedoms are under attack.Mr Geng said Britain restricted Hong Kongrsquos democracy prior to the  handover to Chinese rule and had no authority to discuss matters in the territory, despite the existence of a  agreement that Hong Kong would retain its Western-style economic, legal and political system for  years. Hong Kong was under Britainrsquos rule for  years, during which it was run by a series of governors appointed by the British crown.ldquoThe UK considers itself as awhich is nothing but a delusion, Mr Geng told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday.ldquoIt is just shameless to say that Hong Kongrsquos freedoms are negotiated for them by the British side, Mr Geng said.Chinarsquos central government has voiced strong support for Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and the cityrsquos police force in dealing with the recent protests, which have highlighted doubts about the validity of its ldquoone country, two systems formula for governing the semi-autonomous Chinese region.The protests, which roughly coincided with celebrations of the nd anniversary of Hong Kongrsquos handover from British to Chinese rule, were originally sparked by a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China for trial. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam--Ms Lam has shelved the bills but not agreed to scrap them altogether as opponents insist.Many are also calling for Ms Lamrsquos resignation, a demand she has refused to address.The extradition legislation has heightened fears of eroding freedoms in Hong Kong and given fresh momentum to Hong Kongrsquos pro-democracy opposition movement, awakening broader concerns that China is chipping away at the rights it guaranteed to Hong Kong for  years.Two marches in June drew more than one million people, according to organiser estimates, marking the biggest outpouring of anti-government sentiment in years.copy -.

We’ve declared a climate emergency! However, it doesn’t really feel like an emergency yet. It feels more like waiting in an emergency room which is slowly filling up with impatient in-patients.All that’s happened so far is the Scottish Government has scrapped their proposed cuts on the air departure tax. An important move, as, given limited technological options, we need to curtail increasing aviation demand. Some people are afraid of flying. I think we need to make more people afraid of flying. Perhaps glass floors or actual snakes on a plane  A first step amongst many on the path to consistent decision-making across the economy. But we now need to even the playing field by taxing aviation properly compared to other forms of travel.The Committee on Climate Change’s advice is to make the UK emissions reduction target net-zero by  and that Scotland should do it even faster, by . In typical Scottish fashion, what will spur us on is proving we can do something better than the English. The race is on. You may take our condensing boilers but you’ll never take our freedom !It may very well be rivalry that spurs us on to greatness. Like Andy Murray in the tennis, it is the achievements of those around him that made him work harder to reach the top. Glasgow and Edinburgh are now in direct competition to become the UK’s first net-zero city. Having lived in both cities, I am looking forward to a wind turbine on the top of the Duke of Wellington’s cone and tourists’ footsteps on the Royal Mile powering local homes. If we could harness the unleashed rivalry of Scottish sports fans and turn that into something positive, like ‘nine in a row’ for largest emissions reductions, then we’d sort the problem in absolutely no time. We always want to feel we’re better than our neighbours so get out there, start telling Susan next door about how little you drive and watch her sell that Volvo and become an eco-warrior.: The proof that the private sector cannot secure just transition to green economy – Richard Leonard: Scotland fails to hit climate change targets for past two years in a rowWe have done well so far, especially on decarbonising the power sector, as Scotland’s actual emissions are now half what they were in , back when coal reigned supreme and wind power was virtually non-existent. That is the easy stuff. Heating is next and I don’t knowyou’ve noticed but we are a Baltic nation, so we use an awful lot of it. I think  per cent is my gran. However, there has been very little progress in emissions reductions in transport, agriculture, forestry and land-use sectors, although some plans are now in place.We need to drive electric cars but also have more car-sharing options and to drive less. Changes in road transport will also have extra benefits, mostly health related. Firstly, it will reduce air pollution which hopefully means the only filter kids will need on their face is on Snapchat. Parents often choose quieter routes to walk with their children, away from traffic, as this can cut pollution exposure by almost two-thirds. We’re so afraid of inconveniencing drivers that the people being poisoned are the ones having to change their behaviour. If we continue with that logic we’ll soon just be telling children to stop breathing.Secondly, there’s the benefits of walking and cycling more. Run to the gym to cancel your membership. Then there is changing our diets. To cut emissions I have changed my milk. I now only drink oat milk, which is especially weird when I have it in my porridge. Oat on oat action. I feel like the most Scottish man in the world. I want my oats ground into liquid and poured over more oats. I’ve also gone from eating meat in most meals to only a couple times a week, which has been hard as I like a burger as much as the next Five Guys.In Scotland, it is quite clear that the view on the role of the oil and gas industry has changed since the independence referendum in . This industry which has given us all so much will, whether as part of the UK or not, need to be mostly dismantled over the coming decades. Here, with the current expertise, we have the opportunity to become a world leader in carbon capture and storage that will be required for hard to decarbonise sectors in industry. But it requires signicant policy support to come to fruition.It has been quite the year for climate change in Scotland. School strikes, dire climate reports, wildfires, protesters gluing themselves to buildings, and the warmest February on record. And now a climate emergency. It feels like a turning point. I started my PhD on this very topic about  years ago. Back then we were the first nation to introduce legislation on limiting our contribution to climate change. We paved the way and other countries followed suit. We now have  years to reduce global emissions by  per cent in order to stay below .C increase. It’s time for us to show the way once again and finish the job. Show them how it’s done.However, we cannot underestimate the scale of the challenge required. Achieving this is going to require everybody throwing everything at the wall. This will not be easy. Almost every aspect of society will see signicant adjustments. How you get to work, where you work, how and where you take holidays, what you eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner, what you buy, and how your home is heated. People often say we could do with a war, well here it is, it’s against our carbon-intensive society. Treat it like an emergency and do your part in your personal, professional and political lives.Matt Winning is a comedian and podcaster of Operation Earth, who works by day as an environmental economist at the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources.

However, they were unable to truly test Paul Pritchard in the home goal, either in the remaining half an hour of play of five minutes of injury time.Shetland will now battle for bronze on Friday afternoon when they meet Isle of Man in the third-fourth place play-off match.Manager Main said after the match: #I#m very, very disappointed in regards of the result, but obviously very proud of the display we put on here in front of , people.#We took ten minutes or so to get into the game, but from there and they#re on I think we were certainly competing and then in the second half I thought we owned it and chasing that second ball.#We pushed hard, created chances, their goalkeeper pulled off a couple of great saves and on another day we may have made a decision by the referees.#It will be a tough one to take that, but once again we can take plenty of positives from it. We came here to compete at a higher level away from our domestic season, our domestic league and we#ve experienced some great highs and we were almost there to get into that final.#On how hard it would be to get his players up for the bronze match on Friday, Main said it would be #tough#.He added: #The guys are hurting but I#ve asked them to pick themselves up – and pick themselves up quickly, this is just part of character rolling.#There#s a lot of positive to take away.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course.

Like many people in our society, it has been irrevocably marked by our recent conflict, during which he suffered several personal tragedies, including the death of his eldest sibling, Patsy Quinn – a -year-old IRA volunteer who was killed in action in .Around two years after his brother’s death, Frankie managed to join the IRA, aged , by lying about his age. Many of his subsequent years were spent between being on the run and terms of imprisonment in Portlaoise Gaol, Mountjoy Gaol, Crumlin Road Gaol and the barbarity of Long Kesh. It is these stark experiences, as well as the beautully normal experiences of love, nature, and joy that shape his incredible new book of poetry, ‘Open Gates’.“I found that poetry was a way of expressing some grief,” Frankie said.“It’s a way for me to write down some of my feelings. It was a bit of escapism as well because you can be anonymous in a poem too.“A lot of my poetry would consist of things I was going through personally and things I have watched other people go through. There is a lot of political writing in it – I like to write about Bobby Sands, the hunger strikers, about imprisonment and Irish freedom. There is also a lot of romantic stuff, and some nature poetry.”Despite his current poetic talents, Frankie had little academic success at school, and was barely able to read or write in early adulthood. It was during his time in Portlaoise Prison in the s that he began reading again and studying for his O-Levels. Later while in Long Kesh, he began studying at the Open University and began studying poetry with visiting poetry lecturer, Medbh McGuckian.“Medhb was an influence who came into the jail’s education system and taught some of us and helped some of us create better poems and structure them properly,” Frankie explained.“I had very little education in school. I actually went to school in Belfast, St. Anne’s in Finaghy and then I was a first year in De La Salle, and then we were burnt out of our home in Finaghy. When we were put out by loyalists mobs we went back to Tyrone where my family were from. You’ll find some of that in my writing too.”During his time in prison he read a lot of poems and writings of fellow Irish writers. Some would have a profound impact on him, while others, where deemed modern greats, elicited his criticism.“I’ve read Pearse, and even Yeats, who lived through part of our conflict but never wrote anything about it,” he said.“I see something similar in Seamus Heaney’s poems, which I’ve read a lot of. I haven’t seen a poem about Francie Hughes, who was his next-door neighbour. I think Danny Morrison confronted him about that on a train and I think Heaney said ‘ I was ever going to write about him, I won’t do it now’. People like Danny, and Tim Brannigan and all of those people with a disposition for writing encouraged me a bit. Turlough Connolly would be another person, who was educated in Oxford – he was a very intelligent man who was inside with us as well. Pat Sheehan is another one who would have encouraged our writing.”From his first personal poetry collections – pages glued to the glossy covers of old Open University covers bearing the Long Kesh stamp – to his new book of poems, Frankie’s personal and literary journey is a fascinating one. His works have seen him give talks in and Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dublin, and Cork, with further success undoubtedly on the horizon. However, for Frankie his poetry is all about further understanding, creativity and emotional expression.“Poetry, from a revolutionary perspective, is very important as well. It has an awful lot to add to people’s understanding and struggle. Each poem that is written has a certain message, hidden or otherwise, about certain events. It’s good for people to be able to draw them out. One of my poems is called ‘Hunger’ where I talk about the crystallising of sands, but it’s actually about Bobby Sands and the Palestinian hunger strikers – it’s a play on words. It links the whole lot together and gives a political perspective.”He continued: “It doesn’t matter to meI don’t make a penny out my poetry – it’s all about understanding. There’s a lot of deep emotional stuff there about mental struggle from when I was in solitary confinement. I was in solitary confinement for around four years.“There is certain post traumatic stress that I would deal with, and there is a lot of people in West Belfast and others places here that would have that and they don’t even know it. I like people like that to sit down and be able to read something that they can grasp.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ardoyne dancers top of the world","story":"AN Ardoyne-based Irish dancing school are celebrating after their success at the An Chomhdhail World Championships in Killarney.Lawrenson-Toal Academy of Irish Dance brought home a world champion to North Belfast with Caragh Hendron scooping first place in the under- category.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward.

It is a highly sensitive political construct, a physical manestation of the constitutional dispute between nationalism and unionism.Heavily fortied during the Troubles, and often the scene of bloodshed, the border has become almost invisible since the peace process – with people and goods moving freely between north and south.Despite dferences on many things, there is almost universal political consensus across the island that anyto checkpoints on the border would be a backward step, with police chiefs north and south warning that the erection of physical infrastructure could prompt an upsurge in dissident republican violence.Why are many Brexiteers opposed to the backstop They fear the backstop could lock the UK into a customs union with the EU, preventing it from striking lucrative new trade deals and fulfilling the promises of the  referendum.They insist the mechanism gives the UK no unilateral way of exiting the backstop, without the approval of the EU.In regard to the dferent arrangements in Northern Ireland, Brexiteers also fear the backstop will undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK by erecting economic borders down the Irish Sea.The DUP, the Conservatives’ confidence and supply partners at Westminster, is vehemently opposed to backstop. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A bullet riddled welcome to Northern Ireland sign For the DUP, the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland comes above everything.The party could potentially stomach the mechanismit was time-limited orthe UK could pull the plug when it wanted.The withdrawal agreement contains neither provision, with the backstop theoretically remaining in place “unless and until” alternative arrangements are found.So has anyone found these any alternative arrangements Brexiteers believe they have. They insist it is possible to have ergent regulations and dferent tarf regimes and yet still keep the border open.The key, they contend, is through the use of technology and light-touch monitoring conducted away from the border.Proposals include trusted trader schemes and advanced use of data and IT systems.The Government has established a number of expert  to examine these so-called alternative arrangements while a group of Brexiteer MPs set up their own commission to look at the issue.Among its recommendations, the Alternative Arrangements Commission proposed forming a new UK Ireland single zone for food standards.There is widespread scepticism among EU leaders whether any technology solution exists that could effectively keep the -plus road crossings flowing freely, particularly when it comes to the movement of animals and food products.Brussels has committed to exploring alternative arrangements in talks on the future relationship, but onlythe backstop is agreed up front.And therein lies the current Brexit conundrum."},{"url":null,"title":"grandfather gets the chance to meet his favourite performer lady gaga","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel backs Mr Weber, the German conservative whose centre-right EPP is the largest political group in the European Parliament but lost seats in the EU elections in May.French President Emmanuel Macron has suggested Mr Weber lacks the political and government experience for such a high-profile role.Mr Weber could still be considered for the head of the European Parliament, which is the EU’s only elected institution.Mrs Merkel said there was still a good possibility for Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, the top centre-left candidate from the SD group, to be among the winners of the top positions. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the EU summit Other leaders from the same political family disagreed.The EPP and the SD are the two biggest political groups in the EU, but both lost seats in May’s polls, where far-right and populist parties, pro-business liberals and the Greens made gains.EU leaders want to fill the positions soon because the European Parliament is set to pick a new president next Wednesday.Under EU rules, member countries choose who will run the commission, replacing Mr Juncker. The parliament must endorse that choice. But the assembly has insisted that only the lead candidates from parties that ran in last month’s elections should be eligible for the post.“The lead candidates is not the only criteria,” said Mr Conte.The commission proposes and enforces EU laws on policies ranging from the massive single market to agriculture spending, and from competition issues to immigration.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker The job responsibilities are huge: Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker negotiate with the likes of US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, while the head of the ECB can set monetary policy for the  nations that use the shared euro currency.The outgoing group of EU officials was lopsidedly Italian, with Antonio Tajani holding the parliament top post, Mario Draghi head of the ECB and Federica Mogherini the EU foreign policy chief.Top candidates include current prime ministers Stefan Lofven of Sweden and Andrej Plenkovic of Croatia. Others mentioned include Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier of France, Greens leader Ska Keller of Germany, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition chief since .On Monday a spokesman for Mr Tusk said the summit had been suspended and would reconvene on Tuesday morning."},{"url":null,"title":"campbell welcomes confirmation dup role securing winter fuel payments","story":"East Derry MP Gregory Campbell has welcomed confirmation from the British government that Winter Fuel Payments will remain a universal benefit for all older people thanks to the DUP’s Confidence and Supply Agreement.Mr Campbell received the assurance following a Parliamentary Question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on means testing of the benefit.Commenting, the DUP MP said: “The decision by the BBC to remove free TV licences from over-s has renewed the focus on universal benefits for our older people.“The future of some universal benefits was drawn into question at the last General Election, but thanks to action from the DUP, a commitment to maintain the pensions triple lock and the universal nature of Winter Fuel Payments was secured.”\"The Winter Fuel Payment is extremely important for many people to ensure they are able to live more comfortably during the colder months of the year.

It is also a reminder that this agreement was not designed to deliver for sectional interests, but for everyone in our society and applies both in Northern Ireland and right across the whole of the United Kingdom.“Older people in particular should take heart from this statement.

One will not understand this feelinghe is not hungry or thirsty themselves.“The Muslim community in the city has merged these two principles together to raise donation for the people who need food to feed their families.“There is no better time to run this campaign than the month of Ramadan and there is no better local charity to support this good cause than Foyle Foodbank.“We are collaborating with Foyle Foodbank third year in a row for Ramadan fasting challenge. We managed to raise £, first year, £, second year and £, this year with our Ramadan charity fasting challenge donation project.”Foyle Foodbank manager James McMenamin thanked the NW Islamic Association for their continued support.“There has been a steady increase in the amount of money they have donated each year. This enables us to buy food that we’re running low on and will also help with teaching courses in debt management.”InclusionEach year in the month of Ramadan the North West Islamic Association invites members of the local community to take part in a fasting challenge where participants fast for a few hours up to full day depending upon their capability and preference.Families, friends and colleagues sponsor the participants by donating money.“At North West Islamic community centre we also run this donation appeal and set up donation box as well. Most of the people from Muslim community who attend for prayer and other events put money in this box to support this campaign as well in addition to show support for the participants,” Mr Bahli said.“The most impressive thing is that kids at the Islamic community centre break their kitty boxes to participate in this campaign.“All the participants are invited to join the Muslim community at the time of breaking the fast in Islamic community centre on the day of the challenge. There are a selection of dishes prepared for this day by the Muslim families from dferent countries“This project strengthens the bonds between communities and helps to know each other and to understand ious cultures and traditions in a multicultural environment. There is great sense of friendship, building bridges and sense of inclusion amongst the communities.”He concluded: “These types of projects are vital in a society to promote combined efforts for a good cause and aims which are beyond race, religion and nationality.“North West Islamic association is grateful to the participants of the challenge this year and also to the people who have donated money for this great cause this year and years before and for support in future.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public purse and Sinn Féin believes payments should be paid over a timescale which “protects the viability of public services and businesses.\"Ulster Unionist Finance Spokesperson, Steve Aiken MLA, said “urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

OrsquoHare and Diarmuid OrsquoConnor exchanged points before Keegan and Ciaran Treacy finished the job in added time.Mayorsquos five-point winning margin was a bit flattering and the final result would have been so much more dferent had Down taken all their chances.Downrsquos season is now over, but Tally has laid the foundations for better things to come.Saturdayrsquos defeat may well have been the last game in a Down shirt for a few of the sidersquos older players as there is a plethora of young players just waiting to get their chance and Tally seems to be the man to give them that opportunity.Down: R Burns, D OrsquoHagan, B McArdle, G Collins, R McAleenan, K Kernan, D Guinness, J Flynn, C Poland, C Francis, C Mooney , P Laverty, P Havern , D OrsquoHare , C Harrison .

Only a couple of people said the opposite, that they had been impressed by neither man.For Boris Johnson: Tory member Angela DickinsonA small number of people on both sides of the campaign, who had either said that they were supporters of Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, then said that despite that preference the other candidate had performed better yesterday.“I thought Hunt was best but I am voting Boris,” said one man.“I am a Hunt supporter but Boris spoke very well,” said another.‘A monster has been taken off the streets,’ say family of Laurence Shaw as his killer is jailed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"One couple, Adrian and Felicity Huston disagreed. “Boris was tired,” said Mrs Huston. “But Boris is the future,” said Mr Huston. For neithere: Tory member Angus CreeThis poll was a large proportion of people present yesterday, but a smallish sample of overall NI Tories, who are themselves only a tiny fraction of UK Tories, but even so the NI branch seems mostly pro Brexit and anti backstop, so it suggests respectable support for the moderate underdog Mr Hunt.• The Press Association also got quotes from departing delegates after the huntings, as follows:Gary Hynds, deputy chairman of the Conservative Party in Northern Ireland, said: “It’s going to be a very tough decision, they were both very impressive, and their commitment to the party in Northern Ireland was very welcome as well. “I thought the members will be very happy with that and people will be going home thinking a lot tonight and the days ahead in terms of who they will support. I think it is going to be closer than people maybe think.“Boris has been the front runner from the start, but Jeremy is performing very well and certainly closing the gap and it is going to be very interesting to see who wins.”Some were already clear in their mind about who they would vote for, including Frank Shivers of the North Down branch, who said it is “time for a “maverick”.For Jeremy Hunt: Tory member Rowan Wise“I was going in there voting for Boris and I have been voting for Boris for a while, but I thought that Jeremy came across very credible, a safe pair of hands,” he said.“But unfortunately in the times we are at, we have had a safe pair of hands with Theresa May who I thought was an excellent Prime Minister treated very badly by the EU, Westminster and parts of her own party.“So we need a maverick, we need someone with a bit of charisma, a bit of character and someone who is going to deliver for the people of the United Kingdom.”Angela Dickinson, from Larne, was also backing Mr Johnson.“I thought they were both good, Jeremy is very polished and I do like a lot about what he said. But from the point of view of actually taking us over the line and getting us out of the EU simply because we have got other things to do, I thought Boris did better,” she said.“I have known Boris for some time, I watched him as London mayor when I was in London and he was impressive there. He did things that other people basically couldn’t have done.“The best thing about Boris is his optimism, he always thinks we can achieve things and I feel that together we can do that.”However, Mark Hamilton, from North Down, was left less impressed by Mr Johnson.“I went in veering towards Boris, I thought I’d be convinced because he is well known for being a good speaker, but I went in and he was just another pretty normal speaker,” he said.“I though a lot of what he said had a lot of fluff in it, Jeremy Hunt set out a lot more clear plans in terms of the economy after Brexit - and I think he represents more the country I want to be in after Brexit.”Margaret McVeigh, from Belfast, said she was planning to vote for Mr Hunt.“I came with ideas about who I was going to vote for but I was prepared to change my mindmy mind could be changed by the two people speaking,” she said.“I think today I haven’t changed my mind, I am still going to vote for Jeremy. He was the better of the two speakers today, I think he answered the questions head on, he detailed about what he was planning to do in his four points and generally responded to questions, I thought, very very well.“I thought Boris, it was not his best effort, I lived in London for  years and he was a very entertaining speaker, in fact I campaigned for him when he was going for mayor of London.“But today he was just a bit too much bluster and blag for my liking.”Irwin Armstrong, former chair of the Conservatives in Northern Ireland, said there were striking dferences in the presentations.“We had the organised Jeremy Hunt and a much more off-the-cuff and unprepared Boris — which is probably what we would expect,” he said.Tony Cullon, from North Down, said Mr Johnson’s “dferent negotiating style” could deliver a Brexit breakthrough.“I like both candidates’ Brexit plan, both laid it out really clearly but, for me, I’ve always been a Boris fan,” he said.“I was a Boris fan going into this and I believe personally he’s going to be the one who can deliver Brexit on the st of October for the United Kingdom — compared to Jeremy Hunt, I think it will be Boris who will push it over the line.”Angus Cree, from Bangor, said he came into the event undecided.“And I have left undecided,” he said.“I don’t think either of them have a clear strategy on how they are going to get Brexit through because the EU won’t renegotiate and parliament say they won’t allow a no-deal. And I am worried that the Conservative Party has a pretty bleak future in a general election because they won’t be able to keep voters away from the Brexit Party.”Rowan Wise, chairman of the Queen’s University Conservative and Unionist Society, asked Mr Johnson about his relationship with the DUP during the event.Afterwards, he said: “I have always been a staunch supporter of the moderate wing of the Conservative Party, the One Nation Conservative brand, I think it is very important for Conservatives here in Northern Ireland to set their stall out as very dferent from the Democratic Unionist Party, especially on social issues such as abortion and gay marriage which I believe should be legislated for immediately at the national level.“I believe Jeremy Hunt, while he didn’t say as much, is a much more moderate candidate and does understand the concerns of people here in Northern Ireland.”For Boris Johnson: Tory member Tony Cullontry catch  TrendingWillie Frazer funeral -

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives.

People should be able to disagree with each other without resorting to abuse.Devolution is a journey not a destination. I am proud of what we have achieved over the last  years, making a real dference to peoplersquos lives. I look forward to what we can achieve in the future.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

No violence is acceptable but HK people MUST preserve right topeaceful protest exercised within the law, as hundreds of thousands of brave people showedtoday.mdash Jeremy HuntJuly , He said the authorities need to ldquounderstand the root causes of what happened, which is a deep-seated concern by people in Hong Kong that their basic freedoms are under attack.Mr Geng said Britain restricted Hong Kongrsquos democracy prior to the  handover to Chinese rule and had no authority to discuss matters in the territory, despite the existence of a  agreement that Hong Kong would retain its Western-style economic, legal and political system for  years. Hong Kong was under Britainrsquos rule for  years, during which it was run by a series of governors appointed by the British crown.ldquoThe UK considers itself as awhich is nothing but a delusion, Mr Geng told reporters at a daily briefing on Wednesday.ldquoIt is just shameless to say that Hong Kongrsquos freedoms are negotiated for them by the British side, Mr Geng said.Chinarsquos central government has voiced strong support for Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and the cityrsquos police force in dealing with the recent protests, which have highlighted doubts about the validity of its ldquoone country, two systems formula for governing the semi-autonomous Chinese region.The protests, which roughly coincided with celebrations of the nd anniversary of Hong Kongrsquos handover from British to Chinese rule, were originally sparked by a government attempt to change extradition laws to allow suspects to be sent to China for trial. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam  --Ms Lam has shelved the bills but not agreed to scrap them altogether as opponents insist.Many are also calling for Ms Lamrsquos resignation, a demand she has refused to address.The extradition legislation has heightened fears of eroding freedoms in Hong Kong and given fresh momentum to Hong Kongrsquos pro-democracy opposition movement, awakening broader concerns that China is chipping away at the rights it guaranteed to Hong Kong for  years.Two marches in June drew more than one million people, according to organiser estimates, marking the biggest outpouring of anti-government sentiment in years..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: China says Jeremy Hunt  ubasking in faded glory u after Hong Kong comments article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
