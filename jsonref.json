If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Charity Commission launches inquiry Mahfouz Foundation donations","story":"Share this articleFollowing the donation, Prince Charles told Mr Leus he was ‘incredibly grateful’ and proposed the pair meet after the coronavirus pandemic.But the foundation’s ethics committee rejected the money over concerns about a previous money-laundering conviction, which was later overturned.Mr Leus insisted the money was not returned to him. In September, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Mahfouz Foundation had admitted holding £300,000 of the cash, with Michael Wynne-Parker, a society fixer, allegedly holding the remaining £200,000.In a statement to the newspaper, Mr Leus said he had never heard of the Mahfouz Foundation and was ‘deeply shocked at what appears to have happened to a charitable donation given in good faith’.The Mahfouz Foundation appears to have been set up in 2012 to promote the history and culture of the Middle East to the UK.However there is little information on its website other than a black-and-white photograph of Mr Mahfouz alongside his title, including his honorary CBE.Mr Mahfouz has been accused of paying fixers with links to the prince tens of thousands of pounds in the hope of securing an honour. He allegedly believed a title would help him secure British citizenship. He denies any wrongdoing.For the financial year to the end of April, the Mahfouz Foundation had a total income of just £10,000, records show.It has two trustees, although Mr Mahfouz is not among them. Over the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Mr Fawcett had agreed to help Mr Mahfouz secure a knighthood if he could back ‘three possibilities’ for donations to Dumfries House, Charles’s 18th century mansion.One option was £10million to design and build houses in the area. The Prince’s Foundation was unable to comment because of the ongoing investigation but sources said it would be happy to offer its cooperation on the matter. A spokesman for Clarence House declined to comment.n The High Court’s decision to ban media organisations from a secret hearing about Prince Philip’s will has prompted legal action.Lawyers are seeking permission to argue that a judge did not properly consider the need for open justice. The Duke of Edinburgh’s will is to be kept from public view for 90 years after a September ruling by Sir Andrew McFarlane, president of the family ision of the High Court.The legal challenge, brought by The Guardian, will draw attention to a century-long tradition that sees senior judges lock away wills belonging to royals.British laws hold that all wills should be open to the public to ensure the wishes of the deceased are carried out and to alert creditors.

They can\u0027t even act to insulate Britain. \u0027What hope do we have of them protecting our children, our economy or our country?\u0027The statement concluded: \u0027We say to those who look on in fear and denial - this will impact you and all that you love, and look at what we did.\u0027A few hundred people captured the country\u0027s attention for months.

Instead of cracking down on climate activism, the UK Government should crack down on cold homes.\u0027One will be an international embarrassment, the other a sign of real climate leadership.\u0027An ambitious home insulation programme funded by the Government would lower energy bills, cut planet-heating emissions and boost the UK\u0027s energy security - it\u0027s a triple win.\u0027Boris Johnson must show that he hasn\u0027t left his commitment behind at Glasgow Central station and he\u0027s ready to roll up sleeves and lead by example on tackling the climate crisis.\u0027Liberty director Gracie Bradley said: \u0027We should all be able to stand up for what we believe, but when the means to do so are continually narrowed - whether that be at the ballot box, in the courts or in the streets - people will take to more urgent routes.\u0027While Insulate Britain knew that by breaching the injunction they risked jail, these sentences clearly are disproportionate and another threat to protest rights for all of us.\u0027For years, injunctions have been used by the powerful to stifle dissent and restrict protest rights, while demonstrators have been demonised.\u0027The impact has been stifling free expression, undermining the ability of all of us to stand up for what we believe in - particularly people from marginalised communities who are most cut off from the corridors of power.\u0027Today\u0027s sentences must be seen in the context of the expansive and oppressive powers in the Policing Bill, itself a grab for more power by a Government that despises scrutiny and accountability.\u0027The right to protest protects all of us and is the cornerstone of a healthy democracy.

And a desire not to miss out on the festive season.\u0027Notably, the split between online and physical shopping seems stable, with online 8 percent points higher than before the crisis. Consumers are taking advantage of all the improvements retailers made to their online offers during covid - but they still prefer stores for 7 out of 10 purchases.\u0027 Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics said: \u0027A lacklustre performance across the sector masked a polarisation between the performance of food and non-food retailers.\u0027Clothing retailers reported signs of earlier Christmas shopping as sales rose significantly on last year\u0027s levels, while a return to the office is likely to have helped too. Elsewhere, with consumers much more confident to dine out than last year, food retailers struggled to match last year\u0027s levels.\u0027Looking forward, the consumer environment has deteriorated sharply over the last couple of months and the all-important Christmas boost needed for the industry currently hangs in the balance. \u0027Decade-high levels of inflation, the prospect of interest rate rises and growing concerns about personal finances may trigger some to tighten their grip on spending just when the sector needs it the most. \u0027Many retailers have battled to secure the goods they need for the vital trading period, so discounting will come as a last resort given profit margins are already under intense pressure.\u0027Meanwhile Jamie Rackham, founder of Facebook group Not On Amazon where 156,000 independent makers sell their products for free, said: \u0027If there are any beneficiaries of early Christmas trading, it\u0027s the leviathans of online retail, led by Amazon, attracting what money there is to spend through their vulgar Black Friday advertising, not smaller independents. \u0027Though these figures show retail sales rose in October, it\u0027s brutal out there right now, with many small independents being hit by a toxic cocktail of rising costs and inflation, reduced consumer spending power and the removal of financial support.\u0027 Meanwhile separate ONS figures showed today that British public sector net borrowing, excluding state banks, totalled £18.799billion in October - above economists\u0027 average forecast in a Reuters poll of £13.8billion.The public sector net cash requirement leapt to £61.452billion in October from £6.061billion in September, driven by an expansion of the Bank of England\u0027s Term Funding Scheme to support lending."},{"url":null,"title":"I f ed Azeem Rafiq asks British Jews forgiveness","story":"Share this articleAzeem Rafiq apologises for antisemitic messages | News | The Times"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c82c85bde8d736e6df75fcd0bd2fc50c3e56b3a/0_60_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=5410758d8d73a69afaa774cd02352d3f","title":"howe gerrard and smith tackle first games football countdown live","story":"“We manage people with emotions, everyone’s behaviour is not a flat line.

Defender Jack Stephens is the only absentee with a knee injury. “I must say I’ve been really pleased, myself and (assistant) Craig Shakespeare with the quality, the facilities, the people at the training ground but then the players as well,” Smith said. “The attitude in training yesterday was excellent and the quality hasn’t disappointed for sure. “The reason I’m in this seat obviously is because somebody lost their job because results weren’t happening and the performances weren’t getting results,” Smith added, referring to Daniel Farke. “We all know this is a tough league to get points in but from what we’ve seen early doors on the training ground, there is enough quality to get enough points. Players just need to have that belief. I’m fortunate in that not many managers get to walk into a football club on the back of a win but this is what we’ve done. We beat Brentford in Daniel’s last game and now we need to build on that.”“As long as training is done as I want it to, as long as I feel I’ve given my best, that’s all I can do and I think I will sleep well in the knowledge that I’ve given everything I can for the team and for the club. Then, as always with football, you have to let the game roll. Obviously you can influence the game through subs and everything else, but you just hope that your work is good enough.”“I’m looking forward to the challenge.

It’s been intense but I don’t think we’ve over-worked the players. We’ve tried to implement our philosophy in a steady way and shape the team in the way we want to going forward. “We need the players to play in a natural way but in a way that we want them to. I think that’s a very delicate balance to get into and that’s where your training becomes so important because everything should be done in a way that it becomes the norm for the players. “We’ve tried to implement what we feel the players can grasp quickly and leave a few things for the future.

He said Germany was now in a “national emergency”. Markets reeled on the prospect of a possible German lockdown, with bond yields turning negative, and the euro and stock markets falling sharply. Austria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full lockdown this autumn to tackle a new wave of infections, and will require its whole population to be vaccinated as of February. Germany reported a further 52,970 coronavirus cases and 201 deaths on Friday, bringing total deaths to 98,739. Earlier in the week, the outgoing chancellor Angela Merkel called the situation “dramatic”, saying the fourth wave was “hitting our country with full force”, while the head of Germany’s disease control agency, Lothar Wieler, said the country is heading for a “very bad Christmas season” if drastic measures are not taken to stem the spread of the virus. On Thursday Merkel said that, in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of patients with Covid, large parts of public life would be restricted to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. Germany’s upper house of parliament is expected to pass the new coronavirus measures on Friday. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for this week. I will be back on Monday. In the meantime, Lucy Campbell will be with you to take you through the rest of the days Covid news from the UK and around the world.Reuters note that Hungary, a country of 10 million people whose vaccination rate lags behind the European Union average, imposed new restrictions on Thursday. Masks will have to be worn in all enclosed spaces except offices and sports halls from Saturday, and public events with more than 500 people can only be attended with a Covid certificate.Agence France-Presse, meanwhile, is carrying quotes from the head of Germany’s disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute. Lothar Wieler told reporters that with record-breaking infection levels, the nationwide curbs on the unvaccinated were insufficient. As cases have topped 300 per 100,000 people, the rules for public spaces “are no longer enough in the current situation”, he said, calling it an “absolute emergency”. Wieler called for major events to be cancelled, clubs and bars to be shuttered and private contacts limited to stop the spread of the virus. Germans should “stay home when they can”, he said.Austria will now go into its third nationwide lockdown for at least 10 days from Monday, and make vaccinations mandatory across society from February next year. The new lockdown is set to last until 12 December but could be re-evaluated after 10 days if the pandemic situation has improved. Schools are to stay open but children can choose to go into remote learning mode without a note from a doctor. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg, who has been in office for only a month, said tightening vaccine pass controls and testing requirements has started to make a difference, but “hasn’t convinced enough” people to get vaccinated. Lockdown rules would end for those vaccinated from 12 December but would stay in place for those who have decline to take the jab. “No one wants a lockdown, it is a crude instrument”, said health minister Wolfgang Mückstein. “But it is the most effective instrument that we have available”. The Green politician said constitutional lawyers were currently examining the general vaccine mandate the government wants to come into effect from 1 February 2022. The Alpine republic is weathering the most powerful wave of the Covid-19 virus so far, with authorities on Friday reporting an incidence rate of 990 cases per 100,000 over seven days.The country plans to make Covid-19 vaccinations mandatory from 1 February next year, while the lockdown will start from Monday and will be evaluated after 10 days, Schallenberg said. “Despite months of persuasion, we have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,” Schallenberg told a press conference in the western Tyrol state, where he met regional government heads. He blamed those refusing to be vaccinated for an “attack on the health system”. The lockdown means people are no longer allowed to leave their houses with few exceptions such shopping for essentials and exercising. At the beginning of this week, Austria already began a lockdown for those not vaccinated or recently cured, becoming the first EU country to do so. Agence France-Presse notes that infections have continued to rise. On Thursday, a new record of more than 15,000 new cases were recorded in the country of nearly nine million people. Here’s an updated map with the Covid incidence rates across Europe. The feature will enable those who have had their third dose to travel to countries including Israel, Croatia and Austria, where there is a time limit for a vaccine to be valid to skip quarantine. PA Media quotes vaccines minister Maggie Throup saying people can book appointments up to a month before they are eligible for the booster. She said:  Almost 20 million people have accessed the Covid Pass via the NHS app since it was launched on 17 May, the DHSC has said.Some lessons from “previous simulation exercises” that would have helped with Covid-19 preparations were “not fully implemented”, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). The report, which looked at the government’s preparedness for the Covid-19 pandemic, also found that time and energy spent preparing for Brexit both helped and hindered planning for future crises. The watchdog said preparations for leaving the EU enhanced some departments’ “crisis capabilities”, but also took up significant resources, meaning the government had to pause or postpone some planning work for a potential flu pandemic.

Photograph: Alan BetsonAlmost 200,000 tests for Covid-19 have been carried out over the last week while GP referrals and those with symptoms are being prioritised for testing, chief executive of the Health Service Executive (HSE) Paul Reid has said.Mr Reid said 82 per cent of people who wanted to be swabbed for the virus over the past seven days had received a test in less than 24 hours.More testing centres, staff as well as support from the Defence Forces were being put in place to respond to the increased demand for Covid-19 testing, he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland on Friday.“But 82 per cent in the last seven days have received their swabbing within 24 hours, and yes on some occasions it will go into the next day, so I would ask the public to bear with us.“These are levels that nobody could forecast or see. We have scaled up to meet them, but it’s a significant demand.“So we’re putting in more centres, more workforce, more automation and support from the Defence Forces.”Damien McCallion, the HSE lead for the Covid-19 vaccination programme, said they have seen “a sustained extremely high demand” for tests across community testing centres in the last number of weeks in particular.He said the community testing service was established initially to support the delivery of 15,000 tests per day, and additional measures had adjusted this for peak periods of to up to 20,000 tests per day.Monday, November 15th, was the system’s busiest day to date in community testing with more than 32,000 referrals scheduled.“In recent days it has been particularly busy in test centres across the country, however, we monitor test appointment slots continually throughout the day and slots often do become available later in the day or the following day,” he said.“We have been working on plans to further increase the volume of Covid-19 testing we can provide to communities. We have agreement in place with a private testing provider – they are operating a testing centre on the HSE’s behalf, located at Dublin Airport. This opened on Monday, November 15th, and we are reviewing plans for further testing centres in Cork and Limerick. ”Mr McCallion said the HSE is continuing to recruit additional staff for its test centre and also working to put further additional external resources in place to increase testing capacity including potentially other private service providers.‘Precarious’ situationMeanwhile, Mr Reid said immediate and urgent action is needed to address the current pressure on hospitals due to the rise in Covid-19 cases.He said the situation in the country’s larger hospitals has become “quite precarious” and that for the next 14 days the focus will be on urgent care.In January 10 per cent of Covid patients were in intensive care (ICU) and that level is now 20 per cent, Mr Reid told Newstalk Breakfast.The situation was very difficult and the HSE had introduced a range of actions to mitigate it, such as utilising private hospitals for urgent care, cancer and cardiology treatments, he said.The number of private beds being accessed weekly by the HSE had risen from 1,000 to about 2,800-3,000 bed days per week.The HSE was also examining what surge capacity could be drawn upon to create extra ICU beds from the private hospitals.The extra capacity from private hospitals would provide “some relief”, but the primary focus of the larger hospitals would be on urgent care, he added.Mr Reid said hospitals would have to make their own judgments and decisions on a site-by-site basis.The HSE boss also defended the Irish health system saying that even the best-funded health services across Europe were under pressure at present because of the latest Covid wave.He acknowledged that Ireland did not rank well among OECD countries for ICU beds, but he said that the number had increased by 26 per cent in the past year.Increasing ICU beds was not just about providing the bed, he explained, it entailed staff to support it and each ICU bed required seven highly trained nurses and it was difficult to recruit worldwide during a pandemic.There were 611 people in hospital with Covid-19 on Thursday night, with 118 of those in ICU. The Mater Hospital in Dublin has the highest number of Covid patients in the country with 65, followed by Beaumont Hospital (55) and Cork University Hospital and University Hospital Limerick (both 47).A further 4,650 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the State on Thursday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what new covid restrictions are coming in today","story":"Bars, restaurants and nightclubs have a new closing time of midnightIn response to climbing infections and pressure on the health service, the Government this week announced further changes to Covid-19 restrictions in tandem with new public health advice. Many of the changes took effect from midnight on Thursday.What does it mean for you?Hospitality Bars, restaurants and nightclubs have a new closing time of midnight from Thursday, November 18th, with all customers required to be out of the premises by that time each night. Late-night hospitality was previously required to close by 11.30pm, before the rules were relaxed last month, allowing nightclubs to reopen for the first time since the early days of Covid-19. Although some nightclubs may opt to open earlier than normal, others in the sector will see the midnight curfew as an effective closure order . Hotel bars and restaurants will also be covered by the midnight curfew, with an exception for guests staying in the hotel – as had previously been the case with restrictions on hospitality. The midnight closing time will apply to functions booked in hotels, such as office work parties and weddings. Christmas parties There was no specific guidance or new regulations around office Christmas parties. However, Taoiseach Micheál Martin described recent decisions he had seen by large companies to cancel upcoming parties as “sensible”. Similarly, chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said cancelling office parties, or other social plans and get-togethers over the next number of weeks would be “responsible decisions”. People had a responsibility to reduce their social contacts, he said. Work from home People have been advised to return or stay working from home “unless it is necessary” to attend the workplace in person. Many employers had been arranging for employees to return to offices on a phased basis since late September.Theatres and cinemas The requirement to show a Covid pass, as proof of vaccination or recent recovery, has been extended to cinemas and theatres. Previously, the passes were required for indoor hospitality, as well as for live music events, nightclubs and international travel. Some cinemas and theatres had already required customers to show Covid certs, but the latest change will make the requirement mandatory. There were discussions about whether the Covid pass would be extended to hairdressers and gyms, but they were not included in the latest announcement.Playdates While there is no recommendation around numbers attending events such as playdates or children’s birthday parties, Minister for Education Norma Foley said such activities should now be minimised. “We need to be very vigilant and very restrictive in terms of our social engagements and that applies to families,” she said. Close contacts People who are close contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case in their household are now advised to restrict their movements for five days, even if vaccinated. Beforehand, those who were fully vaccinated were not required to self-isolate or restrict their movements when listed as close contacts.Pandemic Unemployment Payment The Pandemic Unemployment Payment (PUP) scheme, set up to support people who lost their jobs due to Covid-19, will not be reopened, the Government said this week.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said there were plenty of vacancies elsewhere in the hospitality and retail sector for nightclub staff who may lose their jobs. Nightclub owners could avail of the Employment Wage Subsidy Scheme to continue to pay staff, she said. Antigen tests A plan to subsidise antigen tests to encourage wider use is due in the coming days, and this is expected to see the costs of the rapid tests brought down from around €8 to €3 per test. The Health Service Executive currently posts packs of five free antigen tests to people listed as close contacts who do not have symptoms.Antigen tests will be made available in primary schools from November 29th onwards.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"from cavan to kiev the story of se%C3%A1n quinn that won t be forgotten","story":"The spotlight returned to the Quinn family when an extended family member contacted Google seeking to have stories removed from the search engine.

Born into a poor farming family on the Cavan-Fermanagh border, he turned away from farming the land and started quarrying it instead.Quinn was mining rocks but he may as well have been mining gold and over four decades grew his fortune to become a multibillionaire and one of the richest men in the world.Less than 15 years ago he had an estimated wealth of nearly €5 billion with a property portfolio spread across the world. Then he took an incredibly risky punt on Anglo Irish Bank at exactly the wrong time. He lost almost everything.What followed was one of the most extraordinary courtroom battles ever seen in Ireland involving hearings in this country and across the world as the liquidators followed a complex money trail from Cavan to eastern Europe and India.Quinn and his son were jailed for contempt of court and a dark cloud hung over the family and their financial dealings.

About 950 people attended the nightclub on Thursday night. Photograph: Damien EagersThe rationale behind the Government’s decision to order the midnight closure of nightclubs defeated a lot of observers on the first night of its imposition.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had explained on behalf of the Government that nightclubs remaining open after midnight was “risky behaviour” with Covid-19 numbers as they were at present.However, the decision did not deter the 950 clubbers who packed into Tramline in Dublin city centre, nor scores of other people who queued up to get into Pygmalion nightclub on South William Street.Copper Face Jacks, which tends to attract an older crowd, looked strangely forlorn at 9.30pm on Thursday night. In response to the Government announcement, Coppers simply brought forward its opening time to 6pm, but there were 10 people in the establishment by 8pm.The Tramline show was sold out before the Government announced the midnight curfew. Just seven people sought a refund and those tickets were bought immediately when put back for resale, according to Tramline owner Ian Redmond.The appetite for clubbing since October 22nd has been undimmed, he added. Tramline has been open for 22 nights since that date and all have been sold out. Tickets for Wednesday night, the last night of the 2.30am closing time, were all sold in an hour.Mr Redmond said he believed the real motivation of the Government was most likely to hope that the sector would take the hint and close itself, thus obviating the need to pay income supports, while also avoiding the necessity of being seen to impose further restrictions.“That’s how we honestly feel. We weren’t tempted to close,” he said. On the contrary he believes people will enter nightclubs earlier and stay longer as a result. He’s even thinking of having food for early arrivals.There were 350 people inside the door of the nightclub by 9pm, all vaccinated and mad to party.‘House parties’Rebecca Harte (18), a business studies student at Dublin City University, said clubbers are simply going to arrive early to leave earlier. “When the nightclubs stopped at 3am, we went home. Now there are going to be house parties. They can’t be monitored,” she said.“It won’t affect us tonight, but it will affect us in the future,” said Sid Owen (19) who came from Bray for the night. “I finish work at 4pm. I’d rather not track into town. I’d rather stay in Bray.”Lana Field (18) and Eve Healy (20) are two mental health nurses who booked tickets for the Tramline event last week. “We were in a rush to come out,” Eve said. “We had our last lecture at 4.30pm, only got home for 6pm, by the time we were changed, showered and back on the bus we were running late.”As well as a midnight curfew for nightclubs, pubs and restaurants, under the new Covid-19 restrictions, the requirement to show a Covid pass, showing proof of vaccination or recovery from the virus, has been extended to cinemas and theatres.People have also been advised to return to working from home “unless it is necessary” to attend the workplace in person, and people who are close contacts of a confirmed Covid-19 case in their household are now advised to restrict their movements for five days, even if vaccinated.The new measures were announced as the health service came under increased pressure from the rise in cases of Covid-19. A further 4,650 cases were reported on Thursday, and there were 643 patients with the virus in hospital, 118 of whom were being treated in intensive care.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"deforestation in amazon at highest level in 15 years","story":"A Brazilian advocacy group says Bolsonaro’s government went to Cop26 ‘knowing the deforestation data and hid it’. Photograph: Ricardo OliveiraAFP via GettyDeforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest soared 22 per cent in a year to the highest level since 2006, the government’s annual report showed on Thursday, undercutting president Jair Bolsonaro’s assurances that the country is curbing illegal logging.Brazil’s space research agency, INPE, recorded 13,235sq km of deforestation in the world’s largest rainforest, an area nearly 17 times the size of New York City. The official deforestation data covers a period from August 2020 through July 2021.The surging destruction comes despite Mr Bolsonaro’s efforts to show his government is serious about protecting the Amazon, considered critical to staving off catastrophic climate change.The far-right former army captain still calls for more mining and commercial farming in protected parts of the rainforest.At the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow this month, Cop26, Brazil’s government brought forward a pledge to end illegal deforestation by two years to 2028, a target that would require aggressive annual reductions in the destruction.The INPE report, dated October 27th, showed deforestation rising in each of the last four cycles – a first for the data series since at least 2000.“Notice the date on the INPE note. The government went to Cop26 knowing the deforestation data and hid it,” wrote Brazilian advocacy group the Climate Observatory on Twitter.A source with knowledge of the matter confirmed that the government had the data in hand prior to the UN summit.In the run-up to the summit, Brazil’s government had touted preliminary monthly data pointing to a slight decline for the annual period as evidence it was getting deforestation under control. The more refined final data instead showed a dire picture.“The numbers are still a challenge for us and we have to be more forceful in relation to these crimes,” environment minister Joaquim Pereira Leite said at a news conference on Thursday.He told reporters the data did not reflect recently stepped-up enforcement against illegal deforestation, while conceding the government must do more to fight the destruction.Global pactThe data also casts doubt on Brazil’s signing up to a global pledge with more than 100 other nations to eliminate deforestation worldwide by 2030, also announced during the summit.Brazil, as home to the majority of the world’s largest rainforest, was seen as crucial to that global pact. The Amazon’s trees absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet.But some scientists warn that if enough of the forest is destroyed, it could cross a tipping point, dry out and turn into savannah.That would release huge amounts of carbon, virtually ensuring the world cannot hit the targets laid out to avoid the worst effects of climate change.Yet Mr Bolsonaro’s moves to show the government is protecting the forest have fallen short. He has regularly deployed the military to the Amazon since 2019 to aid in policing deforestation. But a Reuters investigation showed military missteps and incompetence failed to rein in the environmental damage.Mauricio Voivodic, head of environmental group WWF in Brazil, said the numbers laid bare “the real Brazil that the Bolsonaro government tries to hide with imaginary discourses and greenwashing efforts abroad”.“What the reality shows,” he said, “is that the Bolsonaro government has accelerated the course of the Amazon’s destruction.” – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"austria reimposes full lockdown and plans mandatory covid vaccines","story":"Police officers monitor compliance with a lockdown for the unvaccinated in Innsbruck on Monday. Photograph:    Jan HetfleischGetty ImagesAustria will become the first country in western Europe to reimpose a full coronavirus lockdown this autumn to tackle a new wave of infections, and will require its whole population to be vaccinated as of February, its government said on Friday.Roughly two-thirds of Austria’s population is fully vaccinated against Covid-19, one of the lowest rates in western Europe. Its infections are among the highest on the continent, with a seven-day incidence of 991 per 100,000 people.Austria introduced a lockdown for all those who were unvaccinated on Monday but since then infections have continued to set new records.The two worst-hit provinces, Salzburg and Upper Austria, said on Thursday they would introduce their own lockdowns, raising pressure on the government to do the same nationally.“We have not succeeded in convincing enough people to get vaccinated,” chancellor Alexander Schallenberg told a news conference, saying the lockdown would start on Monday and the requirement to be vaccinated on February 1st.“It hurts that such measures still have to be taken.”With cold weather setting in across Europe as winter approaches, governments have been forced to consider reimposing unpopular lockdowns. The Netherlands has reimposed a partial lockdown, with bars and restaurants closing at 8pm.The issue has also deepened a rift between Mr Schallenberg’s conservatives and their coalition partner, the left-wing Greens. Mr Schallenberg said only days ago that he did not want to impose extra restrictions on the unvaccinated, even as health minister Wolfgang Mueckstein called for a nighttime curfew. Separately, Germany’s coronavirus situation is so grave that a lockdown, including people who have been vaccinated, cannot be ruled out, the health minister said on Friday.“We are now in a situation – even if this produces a news alert – where we can’t rule anything out,” acting health minister Jens Spahn told a news conference.  Germany reported 52,970 new coronavirus cases and 201 deaths on Friday, bringing total deaths to 98,739. Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Thursday that, in areas where hospitals are becoming dangerously full of Covid-19 patients, large parts of public life would be restricted to those who have either been vaccinated or have recovered from the illness. Germany’s upper house of parliament is expected to pass the new coronavirus measures on Friday. Mr Spahn also said the health ministry was in talks with Pfizer and other companies to order medicines to treat Covid-19. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Attack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"duchess cambridge turns even alan carrs head attends royal variety","story":"Comedian Alan Carr told the Duke of Cambridge he was not hitting on his wife after complimenting Kate at the Royal Variety Performance.Greeting the royal couple at the 94th annual performance, host Carr said to the Duchess: You look absolutely beautiful.Addressing the Duke, the comedian added: Sir, I am sure you do not know who I am but I am not hitting on your wife.Attending Royal Albert Hall on Thursday evening, William and Kate were greeted by the Vice Lord-Lieutenant Colonel Jane Davis as they attended the recording of the show.The Duchess was dressed in a floor length green Jenny Packham dress, while her husband wore a classic tuxedo at the annual charity event held at the Royal Albert Hall for only the third time.Before the performance, a posy of flowers was presented to the duchess by 10-year-old Poppy Clee and the show programme was given to the duke by 10-year-old Rowan Clarke, who was asked what music he liked by William.The royal couple were introduced to Giles Cooper, the chairman of the Royal Variety Charity, and Laurie Mansfield, the charity’s Life-President, who hosted the duke and duchess in the royal box.Mr Mansfield told PA: It is fabulous that it is back, doing entertainment for a full audience of 5000 people.

Having begun with an utterly hollow business case, the reality of this £200 billion railway is now clear – it will not deliver for the very people it was supposedly intended for. With the Eastern Leg scaled back, the entire project is left hanging on borrowed time. It is not too late to scrutinise properly the seemingly endless pot of taxpayers’ money devoted to HS2, or to question seriously whether it is worth going ahead with at all. The Government must come forward with what the severed leg means for the overall cost.Much has happened since the original proposals for the railway were tabled over a decade ago, most notably the coronavirus pandemic. Attitudes to travel have changed fundamentally. We all know that the project’s utility is almost wholly based on purported efficiency gains for businesses operating beyond our biggest cities, yet those efficiency gains have since been met not by a multi-billion pound railway, but by Zoom. We must not let ourselves slip into a false reality dominated by outdated thinking and outdated proposals.This warrants a wholesale review. We simply cannot sustain the extraordinary level of spending HS2 requires for such negligible gain. The cost has almost quadrupled from the original estimate of £55.7 billion.  Covid-related costs alone have added around £1.7 billion to the bill, with almost half of that associated with Phase One. The National Audit Office notes that 50 per cent of the costs for Phase One are still based on HS2 Ltd’s benchmark estimates rather than costs agreed with industry, so these could rise again. The latest revised cost estimates also assume HS2 Ltd will be able to find £2.8 billion in savings – yet it’s had to dip substantially into its contingency budget.In reality, HS2 will end up costing this country a great deal, without delivering for the Midlands or North as originally intended. The completion date for Phase One has already slipped by over four years to 2033. Any and all sections of Phase Two will have to wait even longer. We Conservatives need to Build Back Better now – not in 15 years time. Millions of people in the North want and deserve to have a much better regional transport system than what is currently on offer, but it must be delivered at least this side of 2030 and without sacrificing the livelihoods of the millions living in its path, who have had their homes and businesses gambled by the state at will.The sheer amount of destruction that this white elephant has wreaked on the lives of my constituents, and many more up and down the Phase One route of the line, is astonishing. Never have I seen such a concentrated level of misery among decent, hard-working people – none of whom asked for the daily disruption they are now facing.Whether it be the excessive noise and vibration levels that have shaken houses the plethora of roads falling apart beneath the low-loaders and dump trucks plying their way around otherwise peaceful villages or the enormous loss of endless hedgerows, ancient woodland and protected habitats that I and my constituents cherish so dearly. This is a dangerous assault on innocent communities, some of which will never look the same again, thanks to HS2. I cannot and will not stand by as the destruction continues, and I would not wish this misery on anyone else. Nor will I ever give up hope. The human cost alone is enough to warrant the project’s scrapping entirely. It is unviable, unaffordable and undeliverable. It is unfit for the new reality in which we all live, and the wrong path to take in improving our country\u0027s infrastructure. We must focus on regional and local projects, as the Integrated Rail Plan does, which can actually deliver real opportunities for people. My constituents, like the vast majority of Britons, are proud of the communities and regions in which they live and work. Let us therefore focus on delivering our levelling-up agenda in a meaningful way. More from NewsPolitics latest news: Brexit \u0026#39mood music\u0026#39 improves, says Irish PM as Lord Frost heads to Brussels Covid latest news: Austria to go into full lockdown and make vaccination compulsoryLiverpool terror attacker used \u0026#39many aliases\u0026#39 to buy materials for bomb packed with ball-bearingsBoy, 13, in critical condition after being shot in back in BirminghamBooster vaccinations added to NHS Covid Pass for foreign travelMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uks busiest traffic camera snaps driver every two minutes","story":"Britain’s busiest traffic camera is catching a driver every two minutes in Brighton, as a Tory councillor criticised the city’s Green administration for “cashing in on confusion”.Brighton and Hove City Council has been accused of treating drivers like “cash cows” after experimental “bus gates” in the Valley Gardens area of the city caught out 310 people every day.The four traffic cameras – at Marlborough Place, St George’s Place, St Peter’s Place and York Place – were installed in June last year by the then-Labour administration to monitor traffic on the roads.The bus gates – which force normal traffic to turn left off the major road, only letting buses, taxis and bicycles to continue straight ahead – captured 9,618 motorists in the last month alone, raking in thousands of pounds worth of fines.More than half of the £60 penalty charge notice (PCN) fines issued in October were linked to just one of the cameras.Robert Nemeth, a Conservative councillor, said his “jaw dropped” when he found out about the “extraordinary number of fines” that were being imposed on local people.He said that if traffic was busy for 10 hours a day then at peak times the council was fining 30 drivers an hour or one every two minutes.Speaking at the Green-led council\u0027s environment, transport and sustainability committee meeting on Wednesday where the controversial bus gates were made permanent, Cllr Nemeth said: “The fact that one person is being fined every two minutes at these bus gates is extraordinary.“It is clearly being used as a revenue-raising measure by stealth, which sees the council cashing in on confusion and hurting the city’s economy.”Cllr Nemeth told The  that the council were “ripping off the public” and should be made to “return the huge sums that have been extorted”.He said that some motorists who were confused by the new rules were being fined after driving on the unauthorised roads – despite some attempting to reverse once they had realised their mistake.He accused Labour and the Greens of making the traffic order permanent despite the issues because of their desire to create a “car-free city centre”.Local people expressed their anger at the traffic cameras in the report, which was shown to the committee ahead of their meeting.One objection labelled the bus lanes “completely unclear and unnecessary”, while another accused the council of being “money hungry”.A camera previously dubbed Britain’s busiest in Southampton caught 51,049 motorists driving over the speed limit between 2015 and 2017, triggering more than 320 times a week at its peak. But Brighton’s bus gate caught more than 2,170 a week.Brighton and Hove City Council has been contacted for comment.More from NewsCovid latest news: Austria to go into full lockdown and make vaccination compulsoryPolitics latest news: Brexit \u0026#39mood music\u0026#39 improves, says Irish PM as Lord Frost heads to Brussels Liverpool terror attacker used \u0026#39many aliases\u0026#39 to buy materials for bomb packed with ball-bearingsBoy, 13, in critical condition after being shot in back in BirminghamBooster vaccinations added to NHS Covid Pass for foreign travelMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz term replaced phasing coal cop26","story":"In the week that saw the booster jab rollout extended to over-40s, The \u0027s news quiz is here to find out how closely you have been paying attention to the headlines.Adele released her fourth studio album this week.

HS and Northern Powerhouse Rail have both been downgraded in a long-awaited Integrated Rail Plan. Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson had “ripped up” his own promises and fallen at the first ‘levelling up’ hurdle, adding: “The North of England has been betrayed.”An interviewer asked Boris Johnsonhe thought northerners were stupid after he tried to spin the announcement by saying: “This is a fantastic and a monumental achievement and a great day for rail in this country.” The PM claimed: “What we’re doing is not just the big aposYapos of HS but we’re also doing NPR that runs from Liverpool to Warrington to Manchester to Leeds to York.” Yet neither of those claims are the full truth at all, and it will be the mid-s by the time even the stripped-back projects are complete. Here are all the details of the schemes - which may go some way to explain why so many people are so angry. What has changed  Two massive, long-planned rail projects have been watered down, after fears they would cost up to £bn. Now they’ll cost £bn. More could be spent in future but tens of billions of pounds have still been cut from the projects. The first big change is to High Speed  . The second is Northern Powerhouse Rail .  What has happened to HS  HS was meant to be a brand new Y-shaped line, first from London to Birmingham, then branching west to Manchester and east to Leeds. The West leg is still on but East has been scrapped. The new East line will only run to East Midlands Parkway near Nottingham. From there, HS trains will then run on existing track to Nottingham in one direction and Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield in the other. Officials claim this is an improvement for Derby and Nottingham, which will now get direct HS trains instead of having to get to a parkway station in Toton. But HS trains will not run to Leeds at all. There will be a £m study to look at whether they might in future.  What has happened to NPR  NPR was envisaged by many as a new, dedicated east-west line from Liverpool to Manchester and Leeds. Instead, there will be a new high-speed track only part of the way, from Warrington to Marsden in Yorkshire . Technically NPR trains will still run from Liverpool to York through Warrington, Manchester, Huddersfield and Leeds. But much of it will be on existing track, limiting journey times and capacity. The government claimed building a full Manchester-Leeds NPR line anew would have cost £bn more to save four minutes off the journey. But crucially, axing it means scrapping plans for a new through station in Bradford - England’s seventh-largest city.  What promises has Boris Johnson broken  The Prime Minister told Parliament in February: I can certainly confirm that we are going to develop the eastern leg as well as the whole of the HS. He also pledged in  to deliver a high-speed NPR line at least from Leeds to Manchester, adding: “I want to be the PM who does with Northern Powerhouse Rail what we did with Crossrail in London.” The  Tory manesto repeated that promise saying: We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester. Neither of those things are happening in full. What is the route map  Below is the core route map for HS and NPR by the s. HS trains will leave London Euston, stopping at Old Oak Common station in the capital, and run to Birmingham Interchangeand Birmingham city centre. North of Birmingham the line will branch, with a new high-speed track west to Crewe, Manchester Airport and Manchester. The eastern track will end at East Midlands Parkway, with trains continuing onexisting track to Nottingham, Derby, Chesterfield and Sheffield. Northern Powerhouse Rail will run from York to Liverpool through Leeds, Huddersfield, Manchester, Manchester Airport and Warrington. But only the Huddersfield-to-Warrington stretch will use a new high-speed track, with the rest running on existing track. Separately there will be upgrades to the East Coast, Midland and Transpennine lines.  Will HS still run to Sheffield and Leeds  HS trains from London will still run to Sheffield. A large portion of that journey will be on existing slower track, though the government insists the journey time from London to Sheffield will remain the same as planned at  minutes.. HS trains will not run to Leeds. There will be a project to see how bringing trains to Leeds could be achieved. Will NPR still run to Bradford  Yes, NPR will run from Leeds to Bradford on a branch line with a supposed journey time of  minutes. But there will not be a new line with a new station in Bradford, meaning those wanting to go to Manchester must either change in Leeds, or take the slow train via Halax. What will journey times be like  Faster than now - but slower than under the previous plans. Grant Shapps boasted journeys will fall from  to  minutes for Manchester to Birmingham  to  minutes for London to Derby  to  minutes for Brimingham to Nottingham  to  minutes for Leeds to Manchester and  minutes to  minutes from Liverpool to Manchester. But London to Leeds will take  minutes -  minutes longer thanthe city had got HS. And journeys from the capital to York, Darlington and Newcastle will all take longer than they would have done under HS. Birmingham to Newcastle will take  minutes -  minutes longer than previously planned. Journeys from London to Glasgow will still take three hours and  minutes  minutes faster than currently.  Scroll down for a full table of journey times. What will happen to capacity  Officials insist upgrades will improve capacity across several lines, but critics say this will not happen as much as it would have done with HS. HS and NPR trains will have to squeeze into existing lines with services that are already running with more stops. And Leeds is an obvious loser on capacity it would have had an extra London line in the form of HS, but instead it will have to rely on the existing network. How frequent will the trains be  The government claims train frequency will rise as follows by the mid-s.Birmingham-Manchester: From  to  trains per hour Birmingham-Nottingham: From  to  trains per hour Birmingham-Leeds: From  to  trains per hour Leeds-Manchester: From  to  trains per hour Liverpool-Manchester: From  to  trains per hour Liverpool-Leeds: From  to  trains per hourThere would also be “ to ” trains per hour running through the HS western leg via Crewe. But this will not be as dramatic as it would have been under full previous plans. Other lines will simply see “no reduction in frequency” When will it all be finished  Not for two decades or more. Sly Tory ministers claimed the upgrades would come into service quicker than HS and NPR would have done. They said HS would only have reached Leeds in  while full NPR from Manchester and Leeds would take until . Yet the small print shows many of the headline measures still won’t be finished until the “early to MID s”, despite being stripped back. The timetable for completions is now… By around :NPR services on the existing Transpennine route from Leeds and York to Manchester. Upgrades and electrications to the existing Midland Main Line, East Coast Main Line, Sheffield to Manchester line and Bradford to Leeds line. By around :HS from London to Birmingham, West Midlands and Crewe.By the ‘early to mid s’HS West from Crewe to Manchester. Surviving section of HS East to East Midlands Parkway. Surviving high speed NPR section east of Manchester. Liverpool to Manchester added to NPR network.Full table of journey times According to the government’s plan, this is how journey times compare between now, the original full HS NPR plans, and the new plans.

He added: “We lost very badly in , and my job as leader of the Labour Party has been to change our party, turn it round.” The party chief was asked the pointed question by BBC interviewer Justin Webb after he blasted Boris Johnson for “blowing away” his own pledges on rail for the north.Sir Keir insisted he could “feel a real change in the last two to three weeks” in the public mood, “where people are beginning I think to see the Prime Minister for what he really is.” He added: “He’s a man who has never thought the rules apply to him and his mates - so it’s one rule for him and his mates, another for everybody , and you saw that in the Paterson affair.  “He’s a Prime Minister who thinks he can make promises and then break them and there’ll be no consequences.” But questioned about his predecessor by BBC Radio ’s Today programme, Labour’s leader was more careful in his language.Askedhe was still convinced Jeremy Corbyn would have been a better Prime Minister, he replied: “Well look, the public gave us our verdict on that argument pretty strongly in . We lost.”Asked a second time, he said: “A Labour government would be far better than the government we’ve got.”  Asked a third time, he said: “What I’ve been doing is I’ve recognised the scale of what’s happened.” Asked a fourth time, he replied: “Well look, what have we got in the Prime Minister  We’ve got a Prime Minister who has…” Asked why he would not answer the question, he replied: “A Labour government is always better than a Conservative government”. Askedthat meant Jeremy Corbyn would have been better than Boris Johnson, he replied: “We lost very badly in , and my job as leader of the Labour Party has been to change our party, turn it round, and that’s what we’ve been doing. “I appreciate the rule changes we had at conference are boring process, but they don’t have show we’ve changed the Labour Party and set out a positive case for the future. “But also to draw a distinction between my instincts and the instincts of the Prime Minister, I think that by and large in Britain, people believe we should play by the rules, get on by playing by the rules, and you don’t rip up the rules just to protect a mate.”  It came as Sir Keir said the Government has “blown away” its levelling up plans by leaving the North and Midlands with second-class rail links. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps confirmed the High Speed eastern leg to Leeds had been ditched, and plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail were downgraded. Mr Shapps denied the Government has reneged on rail promises for the region and accused Sir Keir of “misleading people”. But the Labour leader told BBC Radio : “The Government has ripped up those promises and betrayed people in the North. I was in Bradford yesterday and the anger is palpable. People feel very strongly that promises have been made to them and they have just been ripped up. “The idea that ‘levelling up’ is anything more than a slogan has absolutely blown away by what happened yesterday. “The whole point of HS was a high speed line going up including to Leeds. The whole point of the promise of Northern Powerhouse Rail was a new line going from Manchester to Leeds. Trying to upgrade what you have got is a second-class option for the North.” Mr Johnson pledged the full HS line as recently as February. And the  Tory manesto said: We will build Northern Powerhouse Rail between Leeds and Manchester. But the plans were dropped on Thursday with fears they could have cost up to £billion. Instead of HS to Leeds, there will be a high speed line from Birmingham to East Midlands Parkway, near Nottingham. The western HS track from Crewe to Manchester, will go ahead. Mr Shapps told Sky News: “When it comes to HS, we are going to deliver HS trainsthe best way to do that into Leeds. The plan for HS was conceived  years ago. “What we want to do is make sure it actually integrates with these plans for Northern Powerhouse Rail which we are building. “The only disconnect is some of the complaints from, I have to say, largely Labour leaders who are completely misleading people.” Several of the complaints have come from Tory politicians.

The government has backed a Tory MP’s Bill that will ban - and -year-olds marrying with parental or judicial consent. It will also crack down on arranged marriages by making it easier to prosecute parents who send their children off to be wed, either in England and Wales or outside the UK. Currently it is only illegal to force a child into marriage using “violence, threats or coercion”. Under the new law it will be illegal to “carry out any conduct” aimed at causing a child to be wed. That could include booking a flight or a venue. Tory MP Pauline Latham, who brought the Private Member’s Bill, said: “They are too young to make that decision themselves.  The point of this Bill is to stop them having their parents make that decision on their behalf. They are not old enough to do it.” She raised the case of Payzee Mahmod, who “was just  when she was coerced into marrying a man literally twice her age, , who she didn’t know. And that’s in this country, not abroad. She didn’t want to - she wanted to continue her education and go to university.” Ms Latham said Payzee’s sister, Banaz, “was married to an abusive husband. When she tried to leave them, her family told her she would be shaming them. She did leave, but then was murdered by men from her own family and community.” Justice Secretary Dominic Raab confirmed: “Forced child marriage ruins lives.We back this Bill to keep vulnerable young people safe, by raising the legal age of marriage to , and closing gaps in the law which leave them at risk.” The Bill passed its second reading today and will now go into a committee, further stages and the House of Lords before it can become law. However, it does not change the law in Scotland or Northern Ireland where -year-olds can wed, nor make it illegal to help a - or -year-old wed legally in those two countries. Marriages with parental consent have already been declining - only  of , people entering opposite-sex marriages in  were under . But Ms Latham said the figure did not include many unregistered marriages or those happening abroad. She told MPs: For many people I speak to, it is a shock to learn that child marriage is not illegal in this country already and it happens far more often than you might think. In the last  months, the national charity Karma Nirvana has responded to  known cases of child marriage within England and Wales, with the youngest case concerning a seven-year-old girl. We know all too well the devastating impact that child marriage has on young children. The MP for Mid Derbyshire added: The whole point of the Bill is to stop these young people being victims because they are. And eventhereaposs prosecution, we should not expect them to be criminalised. It is not their fault, they are the victims in this situation and what we should be doing is supporting these young people.

The Government lacked a detailed plan on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption, the wide-ranging study of the pandemic by the National Audit Office has found. And some lessons from “previous simulation exercises” – that would have helped with Covid- preparations – were “not fully implemented”, the government watchdog said.The report, which looked at the Government’s preparedness for the Covid- pandemic, also found that time and energy spent preparing for Brexit both helped and hindered planning for future crises.The campaign group Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, which is calling for next yearaposs public inquiry into the governmentaposs handling of the pandemic, has been urging ministers to prove they have learned lessons. Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for the group, said: “This report by the National Audit Office confirms what the whole country has long known, that the Government was unprepared for the pandemic and that our loved ones might be here todaythey had been. What’s most important now is that the Government is able to learn lessons from the inquiry to ensure that we are never in this position again. For families like us, knowing that lessons were learnt from the tragedy and suffering we’ve endured to protect others in the future, is critical to being able to move forward with our lives.” The watchdog said preparations for leaving the European Union enhanced some departments’ “crisis capabilities”, but also took up signicant resources, meaning the Government had to pause or postpone some planning work for a potential flu pandemic.“Some work areas of the Pandemic Flu Readiness Board and the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Programme Board, including scheduling a pandemic influenza exercise in -, were paused or postponed to free up resources for EU exit work,” the report said. The NAO found that the emergency planning unit of the Cabinet Office allocated  of its  full-time equivalent staff to prepare for potential disruptions from a no-deal exit, “limiting its ability” to plan for other crises. “This raises a challenge for the Government as to whether it has the capacity to deal with multiple emergencies or shocks,” the report said. The watchdog found that, overall, the pandemic “exposed a vulnerability to whole-system emergencies”. Although the Government had plans for a pandemic, many of these were “not adequate” for the challenge at hand, it said. It added that there was “limited oversight and assurance” of the plans in place, and that some lessons from “previous simulation exercises” – that would have helped with Covid- preparations – were “not fully implemented”. For example, the report said that Exercise Winter Willow, a large-scale pandemic simulation exercise carried out in , warned that business continuity plans needed to be “better coordinated” between organisations – and this was “not evident” in most of the plans reviewed by the NAO. It also said that following Exercise Cygnus, another pandemic simulation held in , the Government noted that “consideration should be given to the ability of staff to work from home, particularly when staff needed access to secure computer systems”. However, when Covid- hit, “many departmental business continuity plans did not include arrangements for extensive home working”, the watchdog said.  According to the report, the Government had prioritised preparations for “two specic viral risks” – an influenza pandemic, and an emergency high-consequence infectious disease. The latter typically has a high death rate among those who contract it, or has the ability to spread rapidly, with limited treatment options – like Ebola and the Middle East respiratory syndrome . The NAO said that this meant the Government did not develop a plan specic to a disease with characteristics like Covid- – which has an overall lower death rate than Ebola or MERS, and widespread asymptomatic community transmission. It said that, according to the Cabinet Office, scientists considered such a disease “less likely” to occur. The report said the Government was able to use some mitigations it had in place when Covid- hit – for example, the personal protective equipmentstockpile. However, it was “not fully prepared” for the “wide-ranging impacts” that the disease had on society, the economy, and essential public services – lacking detailed plans on shielding, job support schemes and school disruption, the watchdog said. This was despite the fact that the Government’s  National Security Risk Assessment recognised that a flu-like pandemic could have “extensive non-health impacts, including on communications, education, energy supplies, finance, food supplies and transport services”.  Dr Mary Bousted, joint-general secretary of the NEU teaching union, said that “successive governments’ failures to plan properly for an expected pandemic” had “obviously contributed to the Covid crisis”. She added: “The bigger problem, however, has been the litany of failings on the part of this Government once the pandemic struck. “This started with the failure to lock down quickly enough and continued through the premature lting of restrictions to the current situation where simple measures such as face coverings in secondary schools and other measures to control the spread of the virus from schools into the community are still being resisted.” The report also said that, prior to the pandemic, the Government “did not explicitly agree what level of risk it was willing to accept for an event like Covid-”. The NAO said it was told by the Cabinet Office that, as the crisis started, the Government’s “risk appetite changed”, and it “lowered the threshold for the health and societal impacts of the pandemic that it deemed acceptable”. It concluded that Covid- had highlighted the need to strengthen both the Government’s risk management process and “national resilience” to prepare for any similar events in future. The watchdog said the Government had already started to consider addressing many of the issues raised – for example, through its National Resilience Strategy. It went on to make a number of specic recommendations for the Cabinet Office on risk management and preparedness. These include establishing who is in charge of whole-system risks, helping departments to take stock of how funding is prioritised and managed, working with departments to ensure plans are “comprehensive, holistic and integrated”, strengthening oversight of emergency planning, and ensuring lessons from simulation exercises are put to use. The NAO also said the Cabinet Office and Treasury should help departments to “reduce iation in capacity, capability and maturity of risk management, emergency planning and business continuity”.  Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “This pandemic has exposed the UK’s vulnerability to whole-system emergencies, where the emergency is so broad that it engages all levels of government and society. Although Government had plans for a flu pandemic, it was not prepared for a pandemic like Covid- and did not learn important lessons from the simulation exercises it carried out. “For whole-system risks, government needs to define the amount and type of risk that it is willing to take to make informed decisions and prepare appropriately.”Fleur Anderson, Labour ’s Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, said the report showed that “Conservative ministers failed to prepare and they failed the public.“A Labour government will learn the lessons to create a more resilient Britain and ensure that never again is our country left unprepared and dithering when crisis hits,” she said. A Government spokesperson said: “We have always said there are lessons to be learned from the pandemic and have committed to a full public inquiry in spring. “We prepare for a range of scenarios and while there were extensive arrangements in place, this is an unprecedented pandemic that has challenged health systems around the world.“Thanks to our collective national effort and our preparations for flu, we have saved lives, vaccinated tens of millions of people and prevented the NHS from being overwhelmed.”Comment MORE ON The TreasuryMiddle EastNational Audit OfficeEuropean UnionPublic inquiryPublic servicesSecondary schoolFluFitnessThe economyCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And DfE officials have urged schools to make second-hand unorms more available for families too. According to The Children’s Society, parents are spending on average £ per year on unorm for each child at secondary school, while parents of primary school children spend £ on average. The Mirror has previously heard from one parent who said they spent £ on school unorm for her two children last year. She said: Whilst I know itaposs important for a school unorm to have the logo on it and have some branding, some schools have almost everything branded and so we have no choice but to buy from their supplier.Last year my sonaposs secondary school unorm totalled an eye watering £.My daughteraposs unorm was around £.Mark Russell, Chief Executive of The Children’s Society, said: “Until now, too many parents have had to fork out for expensive branded items rather than cheaper alternatives, while having to cut back on essentials like food or heating.So we hope schools are able to start working with the guidance, which should ultimately make it much easier for families to kit out their children for school without breaking the bank.”Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “[School unorm] must never be a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education.This new binding guidance will help to make unorms far more affordable for families by driving costs down as we work hard to level up the country.To support families, schools will have to make sure second-hand unorms are available. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We fully support this guidance. Many schools have a unorm policy in order to give students a sense of identity and pride in their school, and to avoid the pressure children would feelthere was no policy and their peers wore expensive items and fashions they could not afford. “However, schools are acutely aware of the need to keep unorm costs to a minimum, particularly as they often have many students who come from disadvantaged homes. They deal on a daily basis with the impact of the high level of child poverty the Government has failed to address.” Comment MORE ON Nadhim ZahawiEducationSchoolsSecondary school\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One user commented that they went to Yeovil today and found Britainaposs ugliest pub: The William Dampier Wetherspoons.They then added two photos of the flat roof establishment to illustrate their point. The post garnered the attention of thousands of other users, with some agreeing that it is the nationaposs most unsightly boozer, while others offered up their own suggestions for the title.  On the viral post, one Reddit user wrote: That is the epitome of the word grim. Another user wrote: That is depressing. While a third wrote: The pub matches the rest of that town. However, some users jumped to the defence of the pub. One Reddit user wrote: You’re untraveled. There’s plenty worse than this. I’ll do a lap of South Wales tomorrow to show you. Others pointed out that the photos were taken from the back of the establishment, and therefore are an unfair representation. One user wrote: Iaposm from Yeovil. I agree - but the photo is of the back of the pub. The front is facing the High Street.Another added: Looks a bit better from the main entrance. Furthermore, one user reminded others that you should never judge a book by its cover. They wrote: A pub is a pub, doesnapost matterit’s ugly. If I can drink from it, I’m fine. Contributors to the thread piled in with examples of what they thought were uglier pubs from across the UK.  Plans have been in the pipeline since  to build a new £.m garden roof terrace at the William Dampier in Yeovil.Detailed drawings outlining the revamp show a redevelopment of the existing disused first floor - converting it into a mix of indoor and outdoor seating with space for around  people.The project was hampered by the coronavirus pandemic, but in July this year JD Wetherspoon confirmed the project was still planned to go ahead. The William Dampier has also been awarded a platinum rating for the quality and standards of its toilets in the Loo of the Year Awards .  Speaking about the Reddit post, JD Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: Everyone is entitled to their view. The important fact is that The William Dampier is a very popular and well-run pub.

So when the image of the royal carrying out a face-to-face audience at Windsor Castle with General Sir Nick Carter was first seen yesterday, it was seen as a sign her health was improving. But her hands were noticeably purple raising questions about any potential cause, beyond her advancing years.Dr Jay Verma of the Shakespeare Medical Centre told the : “It might be Raynaud’s phenomenon or just really cold hands. The purple is due to deoxygenated blood.”  Purple hands can be caused by “lack of circulation, frail skin, exposed veins, bruising, a leakage of blood to the tissue beneath the skin, the medical expert added. The Queen had not been seen at in-person event in more than a month since she hosted a reception for the global investment summit at Windsor on Tuesday, October . The next day it was announced that the monarch was taking medical advice to rest.It was later revealed she had a night at the King Edward VII hospital for “preliminary investigations.

He has been remembered as a medical powerhouse, like  men in one body, who treated more than , patients throughout his career.

He fought hard to be with his children, the youngest of whom is five, every day. A colleague said: Being a fighter, he never gave up. He kept believing he would recover.

Rossendale and Darwen MP Jake Berry spoke about the alleged incident, which he says happened to a family from Darwen on January  of this year, in Parliament on Wednesday.He told the account as part of a debate on regulation of funeral directors, Lancashire Live reports. Mr Berry said that the incident occurred at Darwen Cemetery and that many mourners left the funeral immediately. The funeral directors, Darwen-based KC Funeral Services, said the details provided by Mr Berry were inaccurate. Mr Berry said: The incident was caused by the snapping of the straps used to lower the coffin into the grave. After the straps snapped at the mouth of the grave, the coffin fell more than eight feet into the open grave, resulting in the exposure of the remains of the deceased. Understandably, many family members and other mourners immediately left the funeral. The family had been led to believe by K.C. Funeral Services that enough members of staff would be in attendance to assist at the graveside, but the family did not believe that was the case. They felt, understandably, very distressed about the situation.  The family later complained to their MP about the funeral directors, Darwen-based KC Funeral Services, as they believed that eventhey had not snapped, the straps used to lower the coffin into the grave were not long enough. However, a spokesperson for the company responsible for the burial said the details provided by Jake Berry were aposinaccurateapos and that they were disappointed he had ulged the information in a public debate. They declined to provide a further statement. In fact,they had had to lower the coffin into the grave themselves, because of the lack of assistance from the funeral directors, they would have ended up lying on their stomachs at the graveside, lowering the coffin to the floor, Mr Berry added. It was a three-person grave, so it was very deep, and my deceased constituent was the first person to be interred. This was an appalling incident, and I pay tribute to Father Brian, who is a well-respected and widely liked parish priest based at St Joseph’s and St Edward’s in Darwen. He assisted the family, arranged for the majority of them to go home, sent away the mourners who had come to pay their last respects, and organised the removal of the deceased’s body from the grave, which had to be undertaken by cemetery workers and the remaining family members. The body was then ed to the funeral directors and another coffin was sought. The body was cleaned, having been at the bottom of the grave, and a team of pallbearers completed the burial the following day, which was Saturday  January. The incident was exceptionally traumatic for the family, who were already grieving the loss of a well-loved family member. Following the incident, they went back to see Emma Childerley at K.C. Funeral Services on  January, in order to ask her some questions about the normal operating practices of her business. They were made aware at the meeting that K.C. Funeral Services was not a member of the National Association of Funeral Directors or the National Society of Allied and Independent Funeral Directors. She confirmed to the family—it was the first time they had heard it, and I must admit that it was the first time I had heard it—that both registration schemes are voluntary. Some funeral directors, including the one I have mentioned, do not join such schemes, largely because of the cost burden of doing so. In light of the alleged incident Mr Berry said he wants to address the gap in the regulations that enables some providers to operate with limited or no regulation. The regulations do not enable families who have suffered in this way, or who have any other grievance, to pursue the funeral directors through a professional body, he added. A spokesperson for K.C. Funeral Services, said: The information contained within this debate are holyinaccurate and I’m very disappointed to learn that Jake Berry would go ahead and ulge this information without speaking with me firstnot to at least learn my side of the story. I am seeking further advice regarding this. I am not prepared to make any further comments until I have sought further legal advice.

Source claimed Emad Al Swealmeenaposs shrapnel-laden device could have caused many casualtiesit had exploded as it was intended. Al Swealmeen, , was killed in the explosion at the Liverpool Women’s Hospital on Remembrance Sunday while hero taxi driver David Perry escaped with injuries. Mr Perry had a miracle escape after the home-made device strapped to his passenger exploded in the back of his cab, and it has been speculated that the bomb went off by accident as the car came to a stop. Police investigating the components of the device now believe relevant purchases were made since at least April this year. The Mail Online reports that experts believeit had gone off as was intended metal fragments would have been aposflung in all directionsapos. This would then have shredded the car before cutting down passers-by, it is claimed. Elsewhere, a source told thethat Al Swealmeen was trying to build a sophisticated, powerful bomb that would have caused “damage, death and destruction” on a large scale.Sources told the newspaper that the bomb may have had a sensitive detonator that went off accidentally.  One said: “In moving to get ready to get out of the taxi, he might have set it off. Or  as the vehicle has come to a stop he has dropped it or jostled it and it has gone off. Homemade devices are inherently unstable.” Another source said investigators are keeping an open mind as to the motive, adding: If he built a much more destructive device then the detonation looks accidental. It looks lucky.” Meanwhile, counter-terrorism sources told The Times that he attempted to construct a device using primary and secondary explosives to magny the blast. Similar bombs were used during the  attack on the London tube, when four al-Qaeda inspired terrorists killed  innocent people in simultaneous attacks in the capital. Although the vehicle was totally destroyed, other vehicles nearby were undamaged.

Merlin Attractions Operations found Martin Hughes guilty of gross misconduct after ruling his vehicle was unroadworthy after it was rammed by a fleeing VW Golf. It also found he was not wearing a seatbelt, he was using his mobile phone while driving, and he was using emergency lighting on a public highway.Mr Hughes - who had worked at the resort since  and was regarded as a role model with an exemplary record - lost his appeal against the dismissal and took his former employer to an employment tribunal after suggesting he may have been concussed, Stokesentinel reports.  But the tribunal dismissed his claim of unfair dismissal. The appeal found his driving dangerous but cleared him of the three other allegations. The tribunal heard that Mr Hughes had been intentionally blocking an exit when his vehicle was rammed by suspected shoplters in August, . But - without checking the condition of his vehicle - Mr Hughes went off in pursuit of the Golf which had children inside. He was suspended the next day.  Employment Judge Christopher Gaskell has ruled: “The evidence available to the respondent clearly suggested that the claimant was aware that the vehicle had been involved in a signicant collision. “If he was not actually aware of the damage, at the very least, he acknowledged that he should have checked for damage before driving the vehicle onto the highway.” He added: “Such incidents are what he was employed to deal with. The claimant’s response on this occasion of driving so dangerously so unnecessarily without regard for his own safety or that of other people, clearly and reasonably undermined the respondent’s confidence in his ability to do his job in the future.” Comment MORE ON Theme parksTribunals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Royal Navy is reportedly working with the Americans to recover the stricken £ million UK warplane that saw its pilot eject from the aircraft. Elsewhere it was reported that Russia is now paying aposclose attentionapos to the UKaposs flagship aircraft carrier in the region. The pilot was part of the UK’s HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier strike force, which was practising for war. It is believed the pilot is recovering and back on the ship following the crash which happened at am on Wednesday. He was rescued after an emergency operation was launched.  An MoD spokesperson said: “A British F pilot from HMS Queen Elizabeth ejected during routine flying operations in the Mediterranean this morning. “The pilot has been safely ed to the ship and an investigation has begun, so it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.”According to navy sources in The Times, the operation has called on the US for help and is set to involve deep water remote-controlled vehicles.A Royal Navy source said: A number of nations have the capability to recover an aircraft from that depth. Weaposve asked the Americans for help and they have offered.  Once the F- is found they will attach huge inflatable bags so it rises to the surface on its own. The source added the military were yet to pinpoint exactly where the aircraft had gone down and were still gathering the equipment needed to recover it. They said bringing the plane back to the surface was aposnot rocket scienceapos but added: aposThe problem is finding and getting to it — you need a machine that can get to that depth. We know the vicinity but we need to find it and attach floating devices to it.  Sky News reports that the Russians are now paying aposclose attentionapos to the aircraft carrier.Defence minister Ben Wallace said: It is not a secret the Russians have been very interested in the carrier group both on the way out from the United Kingdom - as sheaposs sailed and her group towards the Pacic - and now she is back in the Mediterranean. Of course the Russians are playing close attention - it is what Iaposd expect. It is what we do to their ships. We keep an eye on each other thataposs also how we hopefully make sure we avoid misunderstandings and miscalculations. It is believed the FB fighter jet - one of the deadliest warplanes globally - was destroyed in the smash after hitting the sea. There are approximately  F-B jets on the Queen Elizabeth, a £. billion aircraft carrier which is the UK’s biggest-ever warship. The carrier’s F-Bs are equally ided on the ship between the UK’s Royal Air Force and the US Marine Corps. The Queen Elizabeth has a sister carrier called HMS Prince of Wales which is undergoing sea trials. The RAF’s  Squadron is also known as the Dambusters after the famous Second World War raid. At the time of the crash HMS Queen Elizabeth was in the Eastern Mediterranean, on the way back to the UK from the China Sea.

He said: “It is a big change that we are pretty sure will happen next week. “The European weather model generates a high-pressure system closer to the UK and that opens the door to the northerly winds and quite a cold spell.” Then into December and more freezing air blown towards the UK could see the temperature drop to -C in parts of the country, it is claimed. Before that the snow will sweep in from Iceland and Greenland midway through next week. There could be up to cm of snow falling in Scotland and Newcastle in the early hours of next Wednesday according to WXCharts with around cm of snow also landing during the day and heading as far south as Manchester.

One of the ladies stated: Weaposre used to getting a big tree from Norway in Hull, this is much dferent, for the wrong reasons. Resident Jason Nielson said: Itaposs nice that it has lights on it, but it is underwhelming. It could do with more decorations, some tinsel, baubles and maybe a topper would look great.

An extra p an hour might sound like nothing to a Prime Minister who dismissed his quarter-of-a-million-pound second job as “chicken feed”.But for Kathleen, who like millions faces a dficult Christmas, it could be £. on a day’s earnings.Money desperately needed during an imperfect storm of surging energy prices, soaring inflation, tax hikes and the vicious cut to Universal Credit.The Living Wage Foundation calculates a “real living wage” based on the minimum someone would need to live on. In a time of rising prices it has calculated people outside London now need £. an hour , and £. in London . Most unions, meanwhile, are calling for £ an hour minimum.  With , employers signed up to the LWF scheme – with half the FTSE  companies, football clubs such as Liverpool and Everton, and brands from Burberry to Nationwide – the increase will boost the wages of , employees. But it will do nothing for five million workers in Britain who earn less than these amounts, putting them at risk of severe hardship. The country is sleepwalking from pandemic into a low-pay epidemic, where soaring costs simply cannot be met. All while some Tory MPs are “Levelling Up” their own salaries in second jobs that may conflict with the interests of their constituents. “There’s no way I could be an MP without my outside interests,” one backbencher complained to the Financial Times. “My we works full time, I’ve got kids and need the money for childcare.” A fundraiser has even been set up poking fun at Peter Bottomley MP, who recently described things as “desperately dficult” for MPs struggling on £k.  Rachael Baylis, a -year-old graduate who lives in Brighton, was until recently doing two jobs in admin and a pub to keep her head above water. “ Some days I ended up working  hours – it almost killed me. I felt like I was breaking my back doing two jobs. One day I went to work, and I burst into tears at the colleague next to me.” She has now gone full-time at the pub to save on fuel and food costs. “I would like to save some money, but it feels impossible,” she says. “I’ve asked my dad for trainers for Christmas, as mine have holes in them and the soles of my other shoes have ripped, so when it rains my socks are soaked. My jeans, which I have had for years, are ripping. I haven’t bought make-up in years, I don’t think people realise it costs to look presentable.”  Jawad Khan, , who lives in West Yorkshire, recently left a job as a pizza delivery driver on £. an hour because it was costing him to work. “On my wage I was having very little money coming in but then having to pay for £-£ fuel upfront,” he says. “I was using my own car, which meant more miles and wear and tear, it just got too much.” TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady says every worker should be able to afford a decent standard of living. “But Jawad, Rachael and Kathleen’s stories are all too familiar,” she says. “For millions in the UK, hard work doesn’t pay the bills. “Working people face soaring fuel prices, tax hikes and a Universal Credit cut. With prices rising faster than pay, many families will struggle to keep up with basic living costs.  “Ministers must increase the minimum wage to £, ban zero hours contracts and give trade unions greater access to workplaces to negotiate improved pay and conditions.” While the Government uses the rhetoric of Levelling Up as a cover, poverty is deepening across the UK. Our low-wage economy is rubbing up against vast price increases. The £ a week stolen from Universal Credit claimants is beginning to bite. And millions of disabled people who never even received this rise are falling even further behind.

Louise Johnson, , took her iPhone  to be fixed after dropping her handset on the floor last week. Needing her screen and battery replaced, she agreed to pay £ for the phone to be repaired at The Mobile Doctor in Worcester on Saturday. But when she collected it, she caught a male worker leering at intimate selfies of her in underwear and bikinis which she had taken for her boyfriend. Louise said she grabbed the phone but claims the man snatched it back, scratching her hand in the process.  The man has since been fired as the shop apologised and promised a repeat would never happen again. She said: As soon as I walked in, I saw him lock my phone and put it to the side, but I saw my wallpaper so I knew it was mine. I asked whether my phone was ready, and he told me it would be another hour as someone had to come and finish repairing the frame.  But I knew heaposd been on my phone, so I asked for it back, swiped up to see my most recent tabs and saw that he was looking through all my photographs from years ago. Some of them were personal to me. There were pictures of me in bikinis and in underwear which were quite intimate. They were pictures I had sent to a boyfriend and no one . I could see that heaposd been looking at them.  I felt disgusted and was in total shock, I could not believe what was happening. I snatched the phone off the counter but he grabbed my arm and scratched me really hard. I felt completely violated. Itaposs creepy and perverted to go through someone aposs most private pictures without their permission.When Louise demanded her phone back, she claims the man refused to hand it over unless she coughed up £ for the repair.  She called the police who attended the shop and confirmed that CCTV shows the man looking through her phone for  minutes. But officers were powerless to act due to a technicality in the law because the man had not downloaded or shared the images. Louise, a marketing manager from London who was visiting friends in Worcester, added: When I asked the police for the manaposs name they refused claiming it was because of GDPR.  I almost fell over in shock. Basically a strange man can rle through my private pictures without permission but his identity is protected because of data protection  How is that right  The worker involved has since been sacked from The Mobile Doctor. Shop manager Malik Ali said: We have resolved the issue in the presence of police. The worker involved has been sacked. We have apologised to the customer. Nothing like this will ever happen again in future.

For those who thought they’d heard it all, a funeral director has taken to TikTok to show users their ‘biodegradable urn’ The urn is essentially a giant bath bomb which can be used for burials at sea.User @funeraldirector unwrapped the ‘eco sphere salt urn’ which is  per cent biodegradable and can dissolve in less than five minutes.Perhaps the most shocking part is how much it looks like a regular bath bomb that you can buy from the likes of Lush, but giant.  Company Urns for Water Burial gives us some great examples of the giant human bath bombs, from floating lotuses to love note urns. In terms of laws for UK water burials, they are actually surprisingly relaxed compared to other countries.Iniduals don’t need a licence or permission to scatter at sea, and the two main options are from a boat or at the water’s edge. As long as you don’t place any additional items into the water, such as metal or plastics, youaposre free to dispose of your loved oneaposs ashes as you wish. According to Urns for Water, most water urns will dissolve completely once submerged but salt urns can take considerably longer. The urn will slowly sink to the bottom of the sea, where it will gradually dissolve and become one with the water.  TikTok users had mixed opinions on the idea, but a lot of people seemed to love it, with one user replying: “I’ve searched for a way to be extra even in death and I think I’ve found the answer here, quick question though, can I add custom glitter ” Another added: “Coming to Lush next fall, grandma.” It’s important to add thatyou purchase a biodegradable urn, you can’t get it wet until you drop it in the ocean, for obvious reasons.Others werenapost so convinced, with one user saying: But the salt levels of our oceans is already rising and making it harmful for the animals and the fish, I donapost think this is a good idea.Would you want to be turned into a human bath bomb For funeral notices in your area visit funeral-notices Comment MORE ON FuneralsFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday announced curbs on public le for those not yet vaccinated in areas where hospitals are filling dangerously fast with Covid patients.  Austria has also imposed a lockdown for the unvaccinated.Earlier, several hundred people protested outside the Austrian Embassy in Paris against Austriaaposs restrictions, fearing France might be next to reimpose curbs aimed at reducing the circulation of the virus. President Emmanuel Macron said France did not need to follow those European countries imposing lockdowns on unvaccinated people, because of the success of its health pass in curbing the virusapos spread. Those countries locking down the non-vaccinated are those which have not put in place thepass. Therefore this step is not necessary in France, Macron told La Voix du Nord.  Thereports that the European Medicines Agency blamed people not getting jabbed and the delta iant for putting pressure on intensive care units.Dr Marco Cavaleri, of the agency, said: “We are in the midst of what we call the fourth wave.” In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier called for a push for more booster shots to appeal to people who are sceptical about vaccinations.

It is not too late to opt for a first vaccine shot, she told a congress of German city mayors. Everyone who gets vaccinated protects himself and others. Andenough people get vaccinated that is the way out of the pandemic. She added that there needs to be a national effort to get mass distribution of vaccine booster shots under way, since the protection offered by vaccines began to dwindle six months after the second dose. It comes as the UK recorded another , Covid cases, the highest figure for nearly a month. The pandemic also claimed the lives of  people in the last  hours, according to official government data. Boris Johnson said there was a new threat as cases are spiking in European countries including Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.Describing it as a “blizzard”, he said: “We don’t yet know the extent to which this new wave will sweep up on our shores but history shows that we cannot afford to be complacent.” But despite the surge he has not actually triggered England’s ‘Plan B’ - which stops well short of a lockdown.

Jake DeMarco, was shocked by the mystery footage recorded on his home security camera in Melbourne, Austalia. The clip appears to show Jakeaposs dog, Ryder, playing and running around with a transparent white pooch.Jake said itaposs even more chilling because his backyard is fully secured by a locked ft-high fence and there would be no way for another dog to get inside. He sprinted out to investigate after spotting the spooky pup, but it was already gone.  He said: I was out in the garage having a cigarette when one of the four live camera streams caught my eye. Ryder was running around like he was playing with something or someone which isn’t normal behaviour for him, especially at that time of the night “I noticed he wasnapost alone. I was confused and in shock when I saw the footage because I knew Ryder was alone but had a playmate for a minute that then disappeared into the darkness.  My we Amanda and I watch our cameras more than TV now as we are hoping to see Ryders’s playmate again.Jakeaposs brother Simon, , shared the footage on Facebook, with many speculating that a dog somehow managed to get into the backyard whilst others suspect that this was something supernatural.Simon said: “I thought Jake was playing a joke on me and would be laughing at me when I got there.  “Even after seeing a small clip of the footage he sent me I still thought he was up to something “But his voice and the way he told me was definitely not one I’d expecthe was joking so I went to his house straight away. “I canapost explain any of this, I was never really much of a spiritual person and didnapost really think too much about ghosts and spirits. I do now!” In England, one particular bridge is notorious for its ghostly sightings. The apparitions of highwaymen, Royalist soldiers, Victorian gentry and even a coach and horses have allegedly been spotted there. But they pale into insignicance when compared to the notorious local legend of the devil himself. Devil’s Arch Bridge at Pencalenick, Cornwall, is so called because it is said thatyou dare to walk under the bridge, you must hold your breath or the devil will possess your soul and drag you to hell. No one’s come back from the fiery pit to sayit’s true or not, but you’d be braver than most to walk under the bridge at night as there is definitely a spooky atmosphere, just a satanic spit from both Penair and Pencalenick schools.

Brett Connellan was  when he suffered serious injuries to his thigh and hand off the east coast of Australia in May . Fellow surfer Joel Trist and two passing beach-goers, who also happened to be nurses raced over and stopped him from bleeding to death as they waited for paramedics to arrive.He was flown by helicopter to hospital, but the shark had taken three quarters of one of his legs, and doctor feared he would never walk again.Brettaposs dramatic story is now featuring in a documentary called aposPyrophyticapos tracking his le following the attack and watching his recovery.  In a trailer he said:never wanted to be defined by the incident or remembered as the guy that got attacked by a shark. I want to be remembered for what I did afterwards. One of his doctors added: The biggest issue that we had with Brett I think was trying to slow him down. Speaking to reporters back in , after watching friend was airlted to Sydneyaposs St George Hospital, Joel Trist said he heard a scream and paddled towards Brett as fast as he could. I said to him aposwhataposs it like apos and he said: aposItaposs not good.apos And at that point I knew something was horribly wrong, Mr Trist said.  Mr Trist said he dragged his friend onto his board and caught a wave to shore. Ambulance Terry Morrow said at the time that the off-duty nurses saved Mr Connellanaposs le. They applied a tourniquet made from a surfboard leg rope to the surferaposs upper thigh before paramedics reached the scene. He had lost a large proportion of his left thigh, and the quad muscle was torn away right down to the bone, Mr Morrow told the Illawarra Mercury newspaper in .

Katrina Froese first met her date Graham McCarthy, , through a mutual friend earlier this year but it wasnapost until she visited Vancouver for Thanksgiving that he asked her out last month.The -year-old, who had only dated one person before she met the street ministry worker claims she was pleasantly surprised by his apossweetapos gesture when he sent her a link to a Google Form for her to fill in.The bizarre questionnaire read: You have agreed to go on a date with Graham McCarthy. Congratulations! He promises a good time with your preferences in mind. A string of multiple-choice questions followed, including asking her preference for the amount of aposfancy-schmancinessapos, with options ranging from aposbasically pyjamasapos to aposdress and suit and tieapos. It also asked Katrina to gauge her aposexcitement levelapos between a ranking of aposI donapost even want to be thereapos up to aposexcited for the best day of my leapos.In an attempt at landing a second date, Graham then sent her an aposexit interviewapos asking her to aposrate his performanceapos and list any feelings experienced on the date - with options including nausea, butterflies, tinnitus, heartburn and exhilaration.In her clip posted to TikTok, youth pastor Katrina has attracted more than .million views and , likes from viewers - who seemed impressed with Graham’s unique wooing technique. Katrina, from British Columbia, Canada, said she thought the move was “really charming” She continued to say it was just the “kind of thing” that Graham did. Itaposs just so true to who Graham is - a genuinely hilarious, charming and thoughtful guy,” she said. We have been friends since January. We had a couple of friends try and set us up but we both werenapost really into it. We kept in contact. I actually moved during that time and he kept checking in on me as he knew I didnapost have any friends yet. He was very sweet. When I was coming up for a visit for Thanksgiving in Canada, I askedhe wanted to hang out when I was in town and he askedit could be a date instead.” Katrina said she was “kind of surprised” but also “somewhat saw it coming”. When she agreed to the date, he said “great, Iaposm going to send you a Google form,” she recalled. I thought he was joking at first but then he sent me the link. I realised he was serious. As Katrina scrolled through the form, she claims she found it aposhilariousapos and enjoyed the idea that she could even get her date to wear his pyjamasshe selected the option. Katrina said: It was really sweet. I havenapost had anything like this before. Iaposd only dated one person before him and this was very new for me. Iaposm into musical theatre and I mentioned I wanted to see the film, so he askedhe could see it with me. I really loved all the dferent options he gave me, even though weaposd already discussed going to see Dear Evan Hansen before so I just picked that. The aposice skating - handholding optionalapos was so funny and the aposscale of fancy schmancinessapos was humorous as well.” While the move worked for her, she noted that “not every girl would be as into it”. “We were friends first so he knew what I might like to do, thataposs part of it. He put a lot of thought into it and he was specically asking questions and trying to customise it as much as possible for me. Graham claims the idea stemmed from him forgetting whether Katrina was either gluten free or dairy free and wanting to find out, which prompted him to get creative. Graham said: When I have been in the dating world, I often try to add a creative twist. Dating isnapost always much fun and I think that the other person Iaposm on a date with deserves some level of creative effort. I thought Katrina deserved the attention and effort that the humour of the form added. Now weaposre being creative with distance date nights and visiting each other when we can. Itaposs going very well, and I am a very happy man. After a string of successful dates, the pair have since agreed to make it official and have been in a relationship for six weeks, committing to a long-distance relationship while they live more than three hours apart. Katrina said: It worked. Weaposre together now. Itaposs a long-distance relationship but weaposre making it work. Weaposre both really happy and really like each other. Weaposre putting in the work. Heaposs come up to visit me once and heaposs coming to visit me again in December. Iaposve been to him once too so itaposs working. When I posted the video originally, my TikTok content has been mostly about me being a single person. I thought posting it would be a fun surprise for my followers but I didnapost expect it to get anywhere near as much response as it did.” On TikTok, Katrinaaposs followers commented that Graham aposhad gameapos and one user even joked heaposd likely propose using a Google Form in the future. Nick Bostic said: Heaposs going to propose to you in a Google Form. Yes or no  Another user, Ego, said: Iaposm losing my mind. This is simultaneously the funniest and most romantic thing Iaposve ever seen.SOME OF PRE-DATE SURVEY QUESTIONS:- Graham is a man with no car.

Whether it’s from age, bad weather, or the road was paved poorly to begin with, potholes show up.As with most things in le, they can be fixed the right wayor the wrong way, meaning they quickly open up again.Repairing potholes quickly and correctly is important because it prevents further degradation of the road.It seems easy enough to just fill in the open hole in the road or carpark with new tarmac, but this actually is just a temporary stop-gap. The pothole will almost certainly reappear, and the area between the old tarmac and new tarmac will become the weakest part of the road.Our hardworking and at times thinly-stretched front line road men do a terric job but they like all departments are limited by what funding they receive, as is the wider council.As your local councillor I will continue to build on past success in lobbying for more infrastructure investment and will do my upmost to make sure that no road is left behind.While I can#t guarantee success, I can guarantee that I will be relentless in my pursuit of a better deal for our local ward and the wider Argyll and Bute constituency.As we pause to remember the fallen on Remembrance Day our thoughts naturally turn to the veterans of the Second World War, rightly so.This stoic and humble generation made the ultimate sacrice and have been an inspiration for the countless servicemen and women who have followed after them.We must also remember those who answered their country’s call to serve more recently in campaigns in the Middle East, and Europe.Events in Afghanistan this year reminded us all, not least those who had served there and their families, that for those who do their duty, duty does not end when they arrive home.For many, the physical and mental impact of their service remains with them for the rest of their lives.Our mission at the fund is to find all those who did their duty, however long ago, and ensure they know we are here for them, as long as they need us.In celebration of their service, we are calling on members of the public to share their loved ones’ stories as part of our Month to Remember.

She explained that a formal decision on this would be announced next Tuesday, and that consultation with businesses would take place later this week.The First Minister said that extension of the scheme is likely to include a broader scope of businesses, such as indoor cinemas, theatres and other hospitality venues. This would mean that, save for limited exemptions, these venues would require members of the public to provide proof of vaccination before entry. She said that the scheme may also begin to accept proof of a recent negative COVID- test as an alternative to the vaccine passport.Ms Sturgeon, who said that while she hoped to keep businesses across Scotland open throughout the winter, the Government has not completely ruled introducing harsher restrictions should the COVID- situation worsen. She has urged all business owners and employers to think carefully and #look again# at whether their employees can be supported to work from home, this winter.#While we hope we will get through winter without introducing further restrictions, we do have a duty to keep proportionate options under review,# she said.#We are publishing an updated strategic framework today, covering some of the issues have already summarised.#Finally, the First Minister urged the nation to stick as closely to the current guidance as possible in order to prevent the spread of COVID-. This includes undertaking a lateral flow test twice-weekly, and PCR testingyou develop symptoms, have a positive lateral flow or are contact traced.She also appealed to all those who have not yet taken up a COVID- vaccine, and are eligible, to please do so. This includes those who are invited to receive a booster.When it comes to gatherings, the Ms Sturgeon has asked everyone to remain cautious and sensible, and to ensure that indoor venues are well-ventilated.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

Issues of climate, bioersity, equity are all interconnected.She added: “I think it is more powerfulit is a peaceful walk.#Giving her views on the progress being made at the COP, she added: “There are some really hard-hitting things being said, so I hope the issues are getting through to people. It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?1637251037000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211118newscovid 19 thu 18th november figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Currently, people here are not required to prove their vaccination status to enter indoor hospitality or entertainment venues.Stormont recently published a contingency plan which referred to the “potential” deployment of Covid- status certication in “higher risk settings”.Vaccine passports are in force for designated hospitality venues in Scotland and Wales, but England scrapped similar plans.Support here is particularly strong amongst the older age group, with % of over- respondents saying they believe passports should be mandatory. That falls to just over halffor those aged -.The hospitality industry is largely against any such scheme, believing the sector should not be singled out for special treatment, having already been hit hardest by Covid restrictions.Femalesare more in favour of passports than males , according to the survey.There’s a dramatic split in support for Covid passports based on political voting preferences, with only % of the DUP voters questioned believing passports should be brought in as a mandatory requirement.Over half of the DUP voters polled were opposed to any passport scheme , but support was strong from Alliance Partyand Sinn Fein supporters .The polling also suggested strong support for compulsory Covid vaccinations for healthcare workers.Over two thirdsagreed health staff vaccination should be compulsory, with only a quarteragainst. An overwhelming majority of over ssaid the vaccinations should be compulsory, though that figure drops to % of those aged -.DUP voters were split on the issue with % in favour of making vaccinations compulsory and % against, but Allianceand Sinn Fein voterswere strongly in favour.A public consultation on compulsory Covid- and flu vaccination for new healthcare workers was announced last week. But Health Minister Robin Swann said any requirement for existing staff could be “counterproductive” and could further destabilise a workforce that is already severely depleted.Related topicsDepartment of HealthAlliance PartySinn FéinRobin SwannMore On Department of HealthSwann launches fresh push on vaccines as health service struggles with enormous demandLong delays blamed for over , patients leaving AE before treatment finishedCovid booster jabs: Health Minister Robin Swann unveils plan to increase uptakeNI Covid certicate: What do businesses have to do, how will it be enforced and can it be forged Nearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health helpMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServiceTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest CoronavirusCoronavirus NI Christmas restrictions and enforcement warning: Balance not tipping in our favour, Sir Michael McBride cautions#My le has stopped#: NI woman isolating in bid to keep at-risk husband safe from Covid-In times of crisis, Garth Brooks’ country rock is just what his fans needSwann launches fresh push on vaccines as health service struggles with enormous demandTougher home working advice among proposals to curb Covid- threatLatestPolice did not meet standards expected in serial killer probe – senior officerAustralia Ashes preparation hit as skipper Tim Paine quits over sexting scandalViewpointOpinionIrish Street apathy on name a sign of the timesTele man elected to top postBall bearings in Liverpool bomb could have caused signicant death, police say,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

His name was daubed on a wall in Dungannon, along with a target mark.It appeared hours after a -year-old man was remanded in custody on charges which include making threats to kill Mr Swann as well as harassment and improper use of electronic communications.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The abuse directed at Ms Long, in particular the posts by Mr Fox and Mr Peel, have prompted an outpouring of support from across the political spectrum. Lewis actor Mr Fox, the ex-husband of actress Billie Piper, has not responded to requests to comment on his controversial tweet.However, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis was among political leaders who expressed solidarity with Ms Long.“The vile misogynistic abuse that has been directed towards her since yesterday’s vote is disgusting and has no place in this echo chamber or outside of it,” he tweeted.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and UUP leader Doug Beattie also blasted the online abuse.Sinn Fein MP Chris Hazzard accused those behind the abuse of being “cowardly ... to launch the type of attack on a female public representative that Naomi Long has suffered on Twitter. Utterly pathetic.”Northern Ireland’s mental health champion Siobhan O’Neill, who wrote to the Executive to urge them introduce vaccine passports, also offered her support to Ms Long.“I stand in support of Naomi Long and in condemnation of vile, misogynist, personal attacks on women in public le,” she said.”Irish language activist Linda Ervine also pledged solidarity to Ms Long, describing her as “a woman who never lacks courage”.Related topicsNaomi LongRobin SwannUlster Unionist PartyThe Executive OfficeTwitterBrandon LewisSDLPDoug BeattieChris HazzardSinn FéinMore On Naomi Long PremiumAlliance councillor Peter McReynolds who lives with multiple sclerosis to run for Stormont PremiumViewpointOpinionPoliticians do not deserve this abuseNaomi Long and Robin Swann inundated with support following Twitter abuseCovid passports NI: DUP’s Sammy Wilson blasts plan as ‘unacceptable step towards unwarranted state control of people’s lives’ PremiumConcern as PSNI warns  organised crime groups currently operating hereMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServicePictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern IrelandNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic saysTele man elected to top post Covid-linked deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyGlentoran have what it takes to end -year winless run at Crusaders but it won’t be easy, says Mick McDermottRodney Brown: I had nothing to prove after Crusaders departure… I couldn’t be loving Coleraine stay any moreLatestNearly one in  ‘plan to buy now pay later this Christmas’Eddie Howe trying to shut out the ‘noise’ at NewcastleAntonio Conte is a master at getting best from his players – Marcelo BielsaGermany in ‘nationwide state of emergency’ over coronavirus outbreakNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The reality is in East Belfast and in the ghettos and in the areas where you’re likely to get trouble, is that people haven’t got a clue about the protocol, not a clue.“They see it as identity.“They see it as a road to the Dublin Government taking over again and this is a pathway to that. That’s the hard reality.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The protocol was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, by introducing controls in the Irish Sea on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland.The EU and the UK remain deadlocked in negotiations over its implementation, with the new barriers to east west trade creating tensions in some loyalist and unionist communities.Mr Ahern, a former Fianna Fail leader and one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, said the idea that Protocol is about trade “just passes them by”.He added: “In fact they’re not interested. It’s seen as a trick by the south to move the border from across the island, and to put it down the Irish Sea, as a trap for government.“That’s how they see it. Even those who you might consider to be a bit more intelligent and articulate. That is the dficulty.”Mr Ahern said negotiations over the protocol are made more dficult by this view.He said: “We’re trying to do two things. We’re trying to solve the dficulties of medicine and meats and everything  in the protocol.“But there’s another issue in the protocol, and that’s what is in the head and the ideological one, and that’s a far more dficult one to deal with.“ Jeffrey Donaldson well understands how we might get over the detail, and the reason he keeps on about the other issue is because he’s trying to – which I don’t blame him for – he’s trying to serve the loyalist community as well.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming fa .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_ee-ba--aa-baab_embedded

called on Mr Ahern to apologise for his comments.“To associate East Belfast with a ghetto and suggest loyalists are not able to understand the protocol is demeaning and degrading,” he said.“People in my constituency who can’t get their Amazon parcels from another part of the United Kingdom well understand the impact of the protocol.“Rather than belittling those who oppose the protocol, Bertie Ahern should seek to understand why not a single elected unionist in Northern Ireland supports the protocol.“As a man who was central to the Belfast Agreement being negotiated, Bertie should be honest in recognising that the protocol does alter Northern Ireland’s status within the United Kingdom single market without any consent from people living here.”Senior DUP MLA Diane Dodds was also critical.In a post on Twitter, she said: “Coming from the Dublin elite the snide comments in this piece about loyalist communities are despicable.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming c

Credit: Peter MorrisonAmy CochraneTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailIt has been argued that “beauty cannot be measured through mathematics” and ultimately the idea of beauty, within the world of architecture, “is in the eye of the beholder” according to a leading conservation architect based in Belfast.This comes after the city has been ranked as the third most beautul in the UK according to new research conducted using the “Golden Ratio”, after Chester and London.This mathematical formula is a set of proportions that many artists and scientists believe is the “epitome of natural aesthetic perfection”.The Online Mortgage Advisor measured the beauty of over , buildings and  streets in the UK to find out which cities have the most beautul buildings.Liverpool came in fourth place after Belfast and Durhamwas placed fth.Each city was assigned a beauty score, which was each city#s average percentage match to the golden ratio, with Belfast scoring .% with the most beautul building listed as Belfast’s Central Library, scoring .% on the beauty score.Other high-scoring buildings include the Bank of Ireland building on Royal Avenueand the Titanic Belfast which scored .%.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Belfast City Hall was also listed scoring .% and the Waterfront Hall also scored .%.Graeme Moore is a conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, a company which previously worked on two of the five buildings listed as the most beautul in Belfast.“Our company has carried out surveys at the Bank of Ireland building and also a major refurbishment of Belfast City Hall about  years ago,” he explained.“These are both fine examples of Belfast’s ied architecture from very dferent eras, and this research is very interesting that it brings together buildings from  years ago right up to the present day, which just goes to show there isn’t one style more beautul than the other.”Mr Moore pointed out that both the Belfast City Hall and Central Library are examples of Victorian architecture, the Bank of Ireland is reflective of the Art Deco movement in the s when it was built and the Titanic building and Waterfront are both examples of modern-day architecture, with the Waterfront built in the s and Titanic in the st century.He said that the Golden Ratio is not something “the average passer-by would normally notice”.“It’s something that wouldn’t be visually obvious, but it manests itself in creating a very elegant composition, adopted actually from measurements found in nature,” he explained.“I think beauty in architecture, however, can come from a whole iety of sources.“Belfast has a great array of styles reflective of dferent times in our history many buildings were lost unfortunately in WW or during the Troubles but some of the most historic buildings have survived, for example Belfast City Hall and the Central Library.”Graeme has worked in the conservation industry for the past  years and said that it is important to retain this vital built heritage for generations to come.“As a conservation architect we try to find sustainable uses for historic buildings, of course there are challenges, but there is something intangible about an existing building and I think that is what tourists to Belfast or any other city seek out,” he said.“Belfast came of age in the Victorian era so that would have radiated out from the City Hall including fine public buildings and also industrial buildings to do with linen production, adding character to our history, which is very evident in the buildings standing today.”When asked what makes a modern building “beautul”, the architect explained that the materials are important to consider.“It’s important for new buildings to pick up on the materials and character of the old buildings, not necessarily to create a pastiche of what’s been there before, but instead show that they are of their own time and that they respond to building heights and proportions of their historic predecessors,” he said.“Nowadays there is such a iety of buildings in the city, reflective of each inidual time, environment and landscape, so really beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it cannot be judged on any one scale.“I don’t believe that there is any one definition for beauty, either, it doesn’t always come from mathematics, I think there are many factors to consider and each of these buildings listed all have their own unique traits and examples of beauty.”Most ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul

He branded the exercise a “waste of money, time and effort from council officers”.“I want to highlight again the fact another street survey has come back with no responses,” Mr Cuthbertson said. “This is another waste of money, time and effort from council officers.

Somebody has scraped, peeled or otherwise removed the English name, leaving only the Irish.”The councillor said he “purposely let this sit to see how long it would remain”, and that there had not been “a single objection from one other elected representative”.“Had this been the Irish removed, we could have been ensured a chorus of objections from a selection of Sinn Fein MLAs and councillors,” he added.“The fact is that the sign has been damaged in the reverse [and] nobody seems to care.“The Dolly’s Brae site is signicant to the Orange Order because it was the spot of a major confrontation between the Ribbonmen and ing lodges who had been in Tollymore for their annual celebrations and religious service on July , .“I suspect those damaging this sign recognised the historic signicance of their actions.“It again demonstrates how isive these signs are. They can be used by either side of the community to make a political statement, focus anger or ide communities.“Although not a supporter of the bilingual signs, I have asked that this one be repaired and due consideration be given to erecting a historic plaque to commemorate the battle that took place at this location.”Most ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServicePictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern IrelandNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic saysTele man elected to top post Covid-linked deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyGlentoran have what it takes to end -year winless run at Crusaders but it won’t be easy, says Mick McDermottRodney Brown: I had nothing to prove after Crusaders departure… I couldn’t be loving Coleraine stay any moreLatestNearly one in  ‘plan to buy now pay later this Christmas’Eddie Howe trying to shut out the ‘noise’ at NewcastleAntonio Conte is a master at getting best from his players – Marcelo BielsaGermany in ‘nationwide state of emergency’ over coronavirus outbreakNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Peter ByrneNovember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailEven prior to the pandemic, it wasn’t unusual for trusts to struggle to find space for patients in their hospitals.As far back as , the Royal College of Nursingwas warning about the dangers of squeezing hospital beds into areas without oxygen points and call bells, while overstretched staff complained they didn’t have enough time to take toilet breaks or administer medication to their patients.The situation deteriorated to the point where thousands of healthcare staff took industrial action at the end of , but there was barely any time between the end of the strike and the arrival of Covid- for NHS workers to catch their breath.So, it’s little wonder that almost two years of a global pandemic have had such a profound effect on the health service.As of Wednesday, there were  Covid occupied beds across the hospital system here, which is  beds not available for the patients who need treatment for non-Covid conditions, some of whom are acute medical emergencies, while others have been suffering without treatment for years.And while they languish on ever-stretching hospital waiting lists, their conditions worsen and they turn more frequently to their GP to manage their symptoms.However, there aren’t enough family doctors in Northern Ireland to cope with demand, resulting in more people going to AE for help.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up At the same time, an increasing number of people waiting for a hospital appointment are becoming emergency cases, requiring admission to hospital.Meanwhile, staff are exhausted, an unknown number are living with the effects of long Covid, others are trying to process the trauma of working through the pandemic, while the workforce is depleted further due to the requirements of isolation.Add to that the shortage of resources in the community, which makes it so dficult to discharge patients from hospital, and it has created the perfect storm in which we now find ourselves.It is true that the vaccines have put us in a better position than this time last year — but only to a certain degree.Despite the rush when they first became available, health officials have struggled to reach their target uptake.Public confidence in the vaccinations has been damaged by the messages coming from some politicians, as well as the disappointment that they aren’t the silver bullet many people mistakenly believed they would be.The fact that they reduce the likelihood of catching the virus, experiencing serious illness and even decrease the chance of dying from Covid- doesn’t seem enough to convince the sceptics that they are an efficient tool in getting us through the pandemic.Sadly, some have taken an all or nothing approach — either the vaccine works % of the time or it isn’t worth getting, even more so now they have realised the vaccines don’t protect for le.Then there are others who can’t see the bigger picture and the reality that by being vaccinated, they are reducing the risk to those most vulnerable from the virus.Waning immunity is also likely to be a factor in Northern Ireland’s depressing case rate. That’s why the booster programme is so important — but even that doesn’t appear to be rolling out as quickly as hoped. All of this is set against a backdrop of an Executive that has pressed ahead with lting restrictions despite the most ardent warnings from health professionals over the state of the health service.Over the summer, officials were once again caught off guard by the might of Covid-, as case numbers spiked a number of weeks sooner than expected.At the time, they blamed the less than impressive vaccine uptake for the surge in positive cases.As a result of the premature peak, operations were cancelled as staff were erted from their normal roles to help care for the influx of seriously ill patients.Even as the health service faltered and pupils ed to class, the Executive approved further relaxations — at the same time there was a contact tracing disaster in our schools.By the time politicians gave the green light to the reopening of nightclubs, health workers were well and truly exasperated by the path we were on.It was abundantly clear that it wasn’t the best move to allow hundreds of people, many unvaccinated, to cram together in loud and unventilated venues, without social distancing or face coverings, while also adding alcohol into the mix.Even more incredibly, the relaxation was timed to coincide with the Hallowe’en holiday. The warnings from staff on the frontline became more frantic. Unusually senior officials even joined the chorus, with Seamus O’Reilly from the Northern Trust explaining that emergency departments may have to shut in response to the mounting pressure.Then as last weekend approached, rumours began to swirl that the AEs at Antrim and Craigavon were close to collapse, emergency plans were put into place to bolster staff numbers and free up beds. Antrim Area Hospital struggled through, but the measures weren’t enough to stabilise the situation at Craigavon.An ambulance ert was implemented twice in the space of -hours, putting further pressure on the hospitals that stepped in to assist.Dr Tom Black from the British Medical Association gave an ominous warning.“This is only the start of it,” he said, as the crisis appeared to finally shake the Executive into action. Eventhere was an acceptable Covid- death rate, the impact of coronavirus goes much further than those who lose their lives as a result of this wicked respiratory virus.The elderly pensioner waiting eight hours on the floor before an ambulance arrives, the families caring for frail loved ones due to a lack of care in the community, the parents sending themselves into debt to fund their child’s much-needed operation, the nurses, porters and paramedics who consistently work hours past their finish time to give the best possible care to their patients despite the system falling down around them.They’re all casualties of this mess we’re in.It wasn’t dficult to predict, as we failed to meet keep coronavirus under control, vaccination rates stuttered, the temperatures started to drop and winter viruses began to circulate, that even a small number of Covid- cases would be enough to tip the NHS over the edge.Related topicsAntrim Area HospitalCraigavon Area HospitalThe Executive OfficeMore On Antrim Area Hospital PremiumCovid passports on the cards to relieve stress on health service Premium died after catching virus as patients in Northern Trust hospitals PremiumAftermath of funfair ride accident looked like scene of a bomb, says shaken councillor‘Behaviour’ of teenagers and ‘misuse’ of equipment blamed for Carrickfergus ride mal‘It was terrying’: Eyewitnesses share their shock at Carrickfergus ride malMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServicePictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland unlikely to face another lockdown – chief medical officerNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic saysTele man elected to top post Covid-linked deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyGlentoran have what it takes to end -year winless run at Crusaders but it won’t be easy, says Mick McDermottLatestList of teenage homicide victims in London in Northern Ireland unlikely to face another lockdown – chief medical officerRose Ayling-Ellis hails emotional Strictly dance as ‘special moment’Nearly one in  ‘plan to buy now pay later this Christmas’Eddie Howe trying to shut out the ‘noise’ at Newcastle,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For example, there are higher proportions of Catholic staff at AOand EO levels, whereas the majority of staffat SCSare Protestant.”There continues to be a gender pay gap, with the median pay for women .% lower than the median pay for men.Nisra cited the staffing profile of the service as the primary reason for this, with a higher proportion of women working in lower pay grades.As of March this year, the majority of womenin the NICS were at EO grade or below, while the majority of menwere at EO grade or above.As such, the median pay of female staff lies within the EO scale, and the median pay of male staff in the EO scale.In the industrial one wage band, female median pay is .% higher than it is for menAmong other staff, such as those not on NICS pay scales, female median pay is .% lower than male median pay.For gender and community background, dferences of this kind can arise from a range of factors, including dfering proportions of staff in lower pay grades, the report said.Nisra also noted that any increases in pay could be explained by normal progression up a scale — for those people who are not at the top of their grade — and pay scale changes.The average basic pay of NICS staff is now £,, up by more than % on last year. This reflects a change in the median of all pay scales in the service and does not equate to a pay increase.The reason for the overall increase in pay across the NICS is that there has been a sht in the overall grade profile, which has moved the median from a point between the EO and EO pay scales upwards.Basic pay of £, would put someone in the bottom % of staff, whereas salary of £, would put someone in the top %.Around % of staff received an increase in pay between last year and this year.The extent of the increase ied across the grades. For example, % of staff in the industrial two band received an increase between .% and .%.At SCS level, % received pay increases of between .% and .%. These increases can be explained by the fact that the majority of SCS staff are not at the top of their pay scale.The median pay of staff at AO grade in the NICS is higher than in England, Scotland and Wales.Most ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServicePictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern IrelandNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic saysTele man elected to top post Covid-linked deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyGlentoran have what it takes to end -year winless run at Crusaders but it won’t be easy, says Mick McDermottRodney Brown: I had nothing to prove after Crusaders departure… I couldn’t be loving Coleraine stay any moreLatestNearly one in  ‘plan to buy now pay later this Christmas’Eddie Howe trying to shut out the ‘noise’ at NewcastleAntonio Conte is a master at getting best from his players – Marcelo BielsaGermany in ‘nationwide state of emergency’ over coronavirus outbreakNew EU proposals will create ‘express line’ on trade, Maros Sefcovic says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This often meant the sht from in-person to digital forms of output and changes to staffing levels.Looking at the rest of the findings, the survey found that £.m in Arts Council grants from Exchequer and Lottery resources was paid out to  organisations in  , the same figure as the previous year.This contrasted with a drop in income for   of £.mand earned income of £mcompared to the previous year.The loss was offset, to an extent, by increases in income from public sources including the Arts Council’s Emergency Funding Programme and contributed sources, both of which increased by %.There were , people employed by Arts Council funded organisations, representing a % drop year on year.In addition there was a further % drop in contract freelance staff and a % drop in permanent staff.While there were just  in-person activities, the combined audiences for online and digital activity rose to m.Adam Turkington is a freelance creative producer based in east Belfast.He said the impact of Covid- had been devastating for a sector that has already been in a state of financial crisis for a decade.“I feel that the problem that we have in general is that people don’t consider art to be work,” he said.“Another part of the problem is that, to an extent, the people tasked with looking after the arts aren’t fully aware of how many people work in the sector.“There’s a massive number of people who are freelance creatives who are getting on with lots of work without any support.“I’ve been lucky to be really busy over the last year. I’ve had to cancel most of the events we run, but I’ve being doing consultancy work and things like street art commissioning.“I realise that I’m not the norm and it is a really tough time. I’ll be honest though, many of the members of our community were really struggling for cash before the pandemic.”He continued: “Everyone’s inidual stories are dferent, but the Arts Council are largely talking about organisations that were already on the edge because a long term under funding.“So it doesn’t take much to put them in danger.“I run a street art walking tour, and I often say that in Northern Ireland we seem to think that people are artists because they’re too stupid to be doctors or lawyers, but not because they’re good at art.“Actually we should recognise that our artists are just as important members of society.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueIan Marshall with UUP leader Doug Beattie.Christopher LeebodyTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe decision to select a former Irish Seanad member as the Ulster Unionist Party’s West Tyrone constituency Assembly election candidate has been criticised by the local party association.Derry City and Strabane councillor Derek Hussey hit out at the UUP for “seeking to import” Ian Marshall into the constituency and said former councillor Andy McKane should have been chosen instead.A former MLA for the party, Mr Hussey branded the move a “dictatorial approach” from the UUP, saying he urged the party to reverse the decision.Read MoreIan Marshall selected as UUP Assembly candidate for West TyroneFormer Irish senator Ian Marshall joins ‘inclusive and erse’ UUPMr Hussey told the Belfaston Friday morning that the UUP have not yet been in touch with him regarding a statement put out by the association.Ian Marshall was confirmed to be the UUP’s candidate for next year’s Assembly poll in the constituency last month.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Mr Marshall from Co Armagh is a former President of the Ulster Farmers’ Union. He said he was persuaded to join the UUP earlier this year by party leader Doug Beattie.He was also the first unionist to be elected to the Republic’s upper chamber in  as an independent, but lost his seat in elections held last year.In a post on social media endorsed by the West Tyrone Constituency Association of the UUP, Mr Hussey said it was regretful the “unanimous wish” of the association – which had been ongoing over a period – was overruled by the party.He said Mr McKane had previously accepted the constituency association’s call and there was a “firm belief” that with him standing they could regain an Ulster Unionist seat in the West Tyrone constituency.“Regrettably, our party had other ideas, and determined to over-rule the unanimous wish of the West Tyrone Ulster Unionist Constituency Association by seeking to import Ian Marshall, from outside the constituency, to stand for the party in West Tyrone,” the post added.They said a meeting with Mr Marshall “resulted in those present declaring unanimously” that they would not support his candidacy.Mr Hussey said he could not support the “dictatorial approach that has been taken towards my long-time friends and colleagues of the West Tyrone Ulster Unionist Constituency Association”.He called for a “reversal of the current decision” and claimed “otherwise, we face the potential of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory”.Earlier this month, veteran UUP councillor Bert Wilson also criticised the decision to select the former Ulster Farmers’ Union president in the seat.Mr Marshall joined the UUP in the summer following the election of Doug Beattie as leader.At the time he hailed the “revitalised, positive and progressive unionism” within the party and said “the UUP is becoming much more inclusive and erse than perhaps it was a few years ago”.As part of the social media post post, prospective candidate Mr McKane said to have his selection overturned was “disappointing to say the least” and denied it was “a case of sour grapes”.“If the West Tyrone Ulster Unionist Association had chosen a dferent candidate from West Tyrone, I would have given that candidate my full support,” he said.“This is not about my ego, it is about West Tyrone Ulster Unionism and giving us the best chance of winning a seat back.“I believeyou must abandon your principles to gain favour then you are in bother. I am a Unionist with traditional values and make no apologies for being Unionist and British.”The Ulster Unionist Party has been approached for comment.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumAlliance councillor Peter McReynolds who lives with multiple sclerosis to run for Stormont PremiumViewpointOpinionPoliticians do not deserve this abuseActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongTributes paid to passionate NI football fan who died just before Italy game PremiumSarah CreightonOpinionWhy UUP needs ‘scundered’ unionists toto the foldMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServiceTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest Northern IrelandTele man elected to top post Covid-linked deaths in latest week analysed by statistics agencyGlentoran have what it takes to end -year winless run at Crusaders but it won’t be easy, says Mick McDermottRodney Brown: I had nothing to prove after Crusaders departure… I couldn’t be loving Coleraine stay any moreNews headlines: Power NI price hike...

The poll asked voters of each of the five main parties, “The Police Service of Northern Ireland is  years old this year. In this context would you personally consider a career in the PSNI and or support, or at least ‘be okay ’ with a family member considering a career in the PSNI”.Recent figures show of the  officers recruited in , three quarters  were Protestant and just %were Catholic.Earlier this month, the PSNI launched a new recruitment drive.

However, % answered no to the question while % were undecided or didn’t have any opinion.DUP voters had greater numbers of people saying they would not support a career in policing. Of the party’s voters polled by Lucid Talk, % said they would not join or support a family member who wanted to join the PSNI.Just % of the party’s voters polled said they would consider a career in policing or a support a relative who wanted to join the PSNI.While no reason is given, the poll figures may have been impacted by recent allegations of two-tier policing by loyalists. Just % of the party’s supporters said they didn’t know or had no opinion on the matter.In April of this year loyalists rioted across Northern Ireland, with disturbances in Antrim and the Shankill Road area of Belfast. The decision not to prosecute any member of Sinn Fein in relation to the Bobby Storey funeral was cited as sparking the violence. The then DUP leader Arlene Foster called for the Chief Constable to resign as a result of unionist anger at police handling of the funeral.Across the political spectrum, some % of those asked the question indicated support for the PSNI by replying ‘yes’ with % answering ‘no’ and % either not sure or not having any opinion on the subject.Of the two main nationalist parties, SDLP voters indicated most support for the PSNI, with % answering ‘yes’ to the policing question. Those who said they would not support a career in policing amounted to around a thirdof the party’s voters polled, with a further % undecided.Sinn Fein politicians attended a PSNI recruitment event for the first time in . Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and Policing Board member Gerry Kelly attended the event in what was seen as an open show of support for the force.In a recent interview with the Belfast , North Belfast MLA Mr Kelly said: “People have come to me, and there has been a number, looking for assistance to join the PSNI and I have assisted them.”However, he added that the build-up to republicans endorsing policing reforms was a “dficult” one. That appears to be reflected in the Lucid Talk results, with just % of SF voters polled saying that they would consider a career in policing or support a relative who wanted to join.Republicanism’s dficult relationship with the police, despite the Patten reforms, was demonstrated by nearly halfsaying they would not consider a career in policing or support a relative in joining the PSNI. There were % of Sinn Fein voters who said they either had no opinion or remain undecided.Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyUlster Unionist PartyArlene FosterMichelle O#NeillGerry KellyMore On Police Service of Northern IrelandFormer PSNI chief Stephen Martin ‘regrets’ not meeting employee who raised sexual misconduct allegationsMore than  reports of  school TikTok accounts reported since October, reveals PSNICall for social media companies to take action to stamp out abuse from ‘rate your teacher’ Tik Tok videos PremiumNorth Antrim womanappears in court accused of firearms and terrorism offences after DNA found on balaclavaBoy hospitalised after assault at teen disco linked to  Covid casesMost ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias case’ against BBC, corporation insider claimsBelfast declared UK’s third most beautul city with surprise building named prettiest – so say the mathsActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongPictured: Inside south Armagh underground drugs factory raided by policeRevealed: Catholic staff more likely to work at junior level in NI Civil ServiceTop VideosPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayContinental Circus Berlin wows the crowds at Boucher playing fields in BelfastPlayWatch: Derry Girls stars spotted filming latest series at Barry’s Latest PoliticsPM silent on grope claims against his dad StanleyAlliance councillor Peter McReynolds who lives with multiple sclerosis to run for StormontActor Laurence Fox accused over tweet criticising Alliance leader Naomi LongSarah CreightonOpinionWhy UUP needs ‘scundered’ unionists toto the foldNearly , children on waiting list seeking mental health helpLatestStarmer accuses Patel over Channel migrants crisisTwo women and two children die in Bexleyheath house fireDean Smith not planning radical changes in bid to secure Norwich survivalFounder of tech firm where Cameron advised quits after sexual harassment claimsThe key talking points as Wales close their season against Australia,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

fined.“For a long time, the consensus in this country was that we didn’t want mandatory vaccination,” Mr Schallenberg said.“For a long time, perhaps too long.”Most ReadDonna Traynor taking ‘age bias

This development within the Park-based group prompted Caroline to take action and so she got in touch with the Alzheimers Society straight away. Within weeks, the group had organised a dementia awareness workshop which saw almost  people turn up. Caroline said: “When we saw the turnout at these events we thought to ourselves theres something happening here, we have high numbers of people in the community looking for information on Alzheimer’s. “We were overwhelmed with the interest and numbers attending and this led to two further workshops being organised with one specically for businesses –  businesses attended. “The large attendance at the workshops subsequently led to the formation of a support group and a volunteer led signposting centre facilitated by Marie Gormley.” Having noticed the demand within the rural community for more support, Caroline helped set up a partnership between the Learmount group, Alzheimer’s Society and Claudy Health Centre to register to become a Dementia Friendly Community . The group also managed to secure funding through the Rural Development Programme, Housing Executive and Derry City and Strabane District Council. The funding was used to make dementia-friendly adjustments to the community groups building. This included signage, colour coding, training facilities and utensils that those with dementia could use. After seeing an advert in a paper for the Old Library Trusts Memory Cafe, Caroline set off for Derry to try and find out how she could set up a similar one in Park. This meeting started a conversation with the Old Library Trust who expressed an interest in including the Learmount group in their DEEDSproject. Shortly after the Old Library Trust secured funding through the National Lottery Community Fund for the project, Learmounts Dementia Social Club was born. Held every Monday morning, the social club have members from Feeny, Claudy, Park, Dungiven and Donemana attend. “We see ourselves as a Dementia Hub for the community and these mornings work so well for us – they are just the loveliest mornings and everyone benefits from them,” continued Caroline. “The carers come along as well and they get so much out of it too because they are meeting other carers who are dealing with the same concerns as them. “We have such great volunteers here in Learmount who have so much enthusiasm and dedication turning up weekly to help the group.” In , Learmount Community Development Group were nominated by the Alzheimers Society for their Dementia Friendly Awards, which they ended up winning. The north Derry groups services are also listed in the Alzheimers Societys literature which is distributed as far away as Scotland. “The social mornings happened so naturally and it just goes to show youthere is an identied need, opportunities will arise from it,” said Caroline. Although Covid- halted the social mornings run by the centre, they have since reconvened and members are delighted to be back. Just a few weeks back, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Graham Warke paid a visit to the Dementia Social Club to congratulate them on being awarded runner up in the Well Being Category of the IPB Pride of Place Awards. The group was nominated for the award by the council and were delighted to receive recognition for the work of their dementia volunteers, families, the Learmount Group and their DEEDS partners at the Old Library Trust. “Having this service is great because in rural areas it helps to remove the stigma and families are more willing to come forward and receive the support thats there on their doorstep,” continued Caroline. “We have guest speakers who come along to the social mornings and it’s just great to have that support around the table. “We would like to thank DEEDS, Claudy Health Centre and the Alzheimers Society for bringing their knowledge and support. They have been so supportive of the work that we are trying to do.” Although they are at full numbers for the social mornings at present, Caroline hopes going forward they will be able to get more families on-board. “Dementia sufferers get huge benefits from the social mornings, members look forward to coming here because it is a safe environment and they feel included in the community.” The McGrellis family recently visited the Dementia Social Club to present Patrick Conway, chairperson of the Learmount Group, with a cheque for pound, the proceeds from their Dan McGrellis, Memorial Charity Golf Day held on August . In total the McGrellis family raised pound, which was ided between Learmount Dementia Group and Marie Curie. Patrick Conway thanked the McGrellis family for the overwhelming amount raised at the charity event. Patrick continued that the generous donation would be used specically to retain dementia services in the local area and would have a huge impact on the support we can offer families. “Over the past six months, Learmount dementia services have received numerous donations from families living in the area – Shaun Mulhern and Ciaran Hutton, Annie-Teresa OKane and family and the McGrellis family - which we are so grateful for and it means that we wont lose our servicesfunding is stopped.” Patrick encouraged anyone who has a family member who has entered the early stages of dementia and would like support to get in touch by contacting the Learmount Group on .

For Eimhear, it was a moment she had been waiting on since  when she got her first taste of dancing at the prestigious competition which attracts Irish dancers from all over the world. “The first year Eimhear danced at the Worlds she came sixth. In  she came fth, in  she came third and in  she came second,” said Eimhears mum Bernie. With the Covid- pandemic hitting in early , Eimhears dreams of becoming a World Champion were put on hold once more. “She was so close the last year she performed at the Worlds and she just had it in her head that she was for doing this year – she was determined,” Bernie continued. Mum Bernie made the trip to Killarney with Eimhear, who has been dancing with the McNicholl School of Irish Dancing for approximately  years. She watched on proudly as her daughter took to the stage on November  to show her best moves to the judging . It was a tense wait at the adjudicators made their decision and when Eimhears number was called out Bernie said they both couldnt believe it. “We are just so delighted, there are no words for how we are feeling,” said Bernie “We are all just over the moon. Eimhear puts in a lot of work. She goes to classes three times a week and her daddy Anthony got her her own wee studio out the back so she can practice at home. Shed be out there for an hour or more every night.” Paying tribute to McNicholl School of Irish Dancing, Bernie said: “Sineacutead, Seamus and Niall have been really, really supportive of her. They also put in so much work behind the scenes and should be commended.” Bernie said following her success, Eimhear, who attends St Patricks College, Maghera, was welcomed home last week by her proud family and friends. “Eimhear just couldnt wait to get back to see everybody to celebrate her success. All the family were there with a big banner to welcome her home. Fr OReilly even congratulated her from the altar at the weekend masses.” Speaking about her success, Eimhear, who also plays camogie for Banagher GAC, said she really enjoyed the experience. “It is indescribable how Im feeling and I just want to thank Sinead, Seamus and Niall so much,” said the teenager. “I enjoyed dancing on that stage so much and I just couldnt wait to get on there because I didnt have a single nerve in my body. When my number was called out I just burst out into tears, I was just so happy. “My friends couldnt believe it. They were texting me and messaging me when I was crowned World Champion as they were watching it live on Facebook. “Im now planning to compete at the Worlds in April  so Ill be back at the dancing again this week,” she added. Teacher Sineacutead Burke also paid tribute to the north Derry dancer. She said: “Eimhear is a really good example of hard work pays off and not giving up.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

More than  years ago, a commitment was made to take action to promote and protect the Irish language in the Good Friday Agreement. This was reaffirmed in the  St Andrews Agreement, Language legislation was also promised in the New Decade New Approach deal in January  but the fact an Irish Language Act has still not been implemented gives grounds, according to Mr Delargy, for the Secretary of State to intervene. He said: “Sinn Feacutein backAn Dream Dearg’s call on the British Secretary of State to live up to his commitments to legislate for an Acht Gaeilge. “The British Secretary of State Brandon Lewis said at the end of October that he would introduce the legislation. “Irish Language legislation is crucial to delivering genuine recognition to the equal rights and status of an ever-growing community of Gaeilgeoiriacute across our island. “Acht Gaeilge is long overdue. There can be no more delays and the British government should get on with implementing its commitments.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

She was admitted to hospital with stroke-like symptoms.  However, In December, Nicoles condition deteriorated signicantly and she lost her eyesight  Speaking to the Donegal Live, Geraldine McDermott said she and her family were “overwhelmed” with the fundraising effort currently taking place in Inishowen and wider Donegal to support Nicoles future treatment.  FND is a medical condition in which there is a problem with the ing of the nervous system and how the brain and body sends and   or receives signals. Symptoms can include motor dys, seizures, vision and speech dficulties, and paralysis. Geraldine said: “Nicole will be under the care of Neurologist, Professor Mark Edwards. Professor Edwards specialises in FND. He will prepare a rehabilitation plan for Nicole. She will be an in-patient in the Brain and Mind Hospital in London for anything from six weeks onwards, depending on how much time she needs.  “FND is essentially a signal, a message from the brain which is not getting to the body. Professor Edwards is hopeful they can turn the signals on again and restore Nicoles eyesight.  “There has been a massive, massive fundraising effort for Nicole. It started off with Veronica Dowds Long completing a k, which finished up in the Wooden Brew Coffee Shop in Burnfoot, where they had a coffee morning. There was another coffee morning in OFlahertys Pub in Buncrana and there was a golf tournament at the North West Golf Club at Lisfannon. Well known Gael, Burnfoots Andrew Wallace organised a Run for Nicole k on November  Sister Act held an event in OFlahertys, Burt GAA held a fundraiser and Burnfoot Service Station sold lines and raised €,. We cannot thank everyone enough.  “On Sundaythere will be a stellar line-up at our major fundraising concert in An Grianaacuten Hotel in Burt. The artists performing include, John McNicholl, Dominic Kirwan and Sandy Kelly, along with local musician, Keelan Arbuckle, and young Killian Joe.” The David Craig Band, which played at Nicole and Ciarans wedding two years ago, is also playing at the An Grianaacuten concert. Tickets for the event are available from the hotel and Creative Landscaping Works in Letterkenny and from Geraldine who can be contacted on: . According to Geraldine, up until December , Nicoles quality of le was fine. She added: “Nicole was having daily seizures and was in chronic pain but she could manage. If she had a seizure, we dealt with it. Maybe a stranger looking on would have thought it was terrible but, it was part of our lives, part of Nicole. “But, in December, she lost her eyesight and then she lost her speech. She now has limited speech and is in bed all the time. She has no social interaction at all now.  “We met Professor Edwards on October . because she will not be well enough, initially, to travel to London, she will begin her treatment here. We have raised €, for Nicoles treatment to date and are going to continue fundraising.  “We would definitely like to thank everybody from the bottom of our hearts. We are overwhelmed. Nicoles consultant is hopeful her eyesight can be restored, as well as her speech and some of her mobility. There is definitely hope.  “I would like to thank everybody.

The court heard how police had been called to Secrets night club, Magherafelt, at around .pm on the night of December  , where the security manager told them he had ejected a female. The manager told police she had bottled another female over the head while inside, knocking her unconscious in the process. The injured party had then been taken to AE, where she was forced to remain overnight and had surgical glue applied to a wound. When being arrested, the defendant became irate and police reports from the night in question revealed she shouted “F**k you, f**k your ma and f**k your da” at police and members of the public. She also yelled repeatedly that she did not hit anybody. Later, on viewing CCTV footage of the incident, a guilty plea was entered by the defendant. Judge Mullan noted that the contents of a pre-sentence report completed on McKenna did not endear her to the court. While discussing the injuries to the other female, the report noted the defendant as saying: “She got hair extensions a few days later.” Defence for McKenna said the incident had arisen due to a school-type hostility between the women. Although noting the defendant had no previous record, they conceded that due to the amount of alcohol taken, the defendant had made her debut in a most spectacular way. Counsel also noted that at the time of the offence, McKenna had been just  years old, and had been initially charged in a youth court but turned  in the meantime. They said the incident should be viewed in the context that the defendant was a youth who was intoxicated on licensed premises and that the behaviour was consistent with that context. McKenna had indicated she was unable to complete community service or probation, and Judge Mullan told the court this had limited the options available to her. She sentenced the defendant to four months imprisonment, suspended for a period of  months, and issued a three-year restraining order prohibiting her from contacting the injured party.

Judge Mullan began by telling the court the defendants pre-sentence report had made for unbelievable reading, and that she had no regard for road traffic laws. She said Johnston had already received suspended sentences, probation and disqualication, but that she continued to get into a car in the knowledge that she could well go to prison. Addressing the defendant, the judge asked why this was the case. “A lot of it has to do with my head, but Ive been working with the mental health team to get it in order,” she replied. Judge Mullan told the defendant the court had been patient with her, and noted she had even gone out, bought a vehicle while disqualied and then subsequently drove the vehicle. Defence for Johnston said she had engaged with probation and that they hoped she had begun a process of rehabilitation as a result. The court was told the defendant now understood she could not just get in a car and drive anymore. Judge Mullan ordered Johnston to complete  hours of community service, fined her pound and disqualied her from driving for a further period of  months. A pound offenders levy was also imposed, and the defendant was advised by the judge not to buy any more vehicles while disqualied from driving.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in .

Pic by Seb Daly SportsfileReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk tonight, but he is still hoping to write more chapters in what has so far been a career of glittering success. googletag.cmd.push Ironically, McEleney will bid his farewells to Oriel Park at the end of the game against his new club and hometown team in Derry City. While the Dundalk fans will be saying goodbye, the travelling City fans will be welcoming home a prodigal son in the same breath. McEleney signed with the Lilywhites in December , as he went on the search for trophies – and in that, he has succeeded. Three league titles,  FAI Cups and  League Cups have all been won in Dundalk colours, and he has been part of two squads who have made it to the Europa League group stages. For all those achievements, he has a thousand more memories scoring against BATE Borislov in the Champions League qualying round, scoring a penalty against Sherf Tiraspol to help Dundalk qualy for the - Europa League group stages, and playing against Arsenal at the Emirates. Any footballer would be proud to look back on all that, but not Patrick. For him the past is the past, and he wants to achieve so much more now that he is ing to Derry City. If anything, he is even hungrier than he was when he left the Brandywell six years ago. “It came full circle,” he agrees. “I’m properly excited to kick on with Derry City and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve been watching them a lot, especially since I’ve signed and I’ve been trying to pick up things. There are some really good players there which I knew from playing against them anyway. I’m really looking forward to next year and getting my family back home.” “Whenever he contacted me in  he said he really wanted me and he explained how I was going to fit in and how I was going to play. I went down that first year and won the league and got to the Europa League Group Stages and that was surreal to be honest. “Being in that environment I knew there was only one way it was going and we were going to be successful for a lot of years. I was just thankful to Stephen for the opportunity, but I had no doubts in my own ability and what I was going to be able to do for the team. It was amazing times, but it’s gone now, and it’s in the past and it’s time to make new memories.” McEleney did enjoy some success with Derry City after arriving back from Sunderland back in . A part of the squad which win the First Division that year, McEleney went on to win a League Cup in  and the FAI Cup in . Since then, Derry City have won just one trophy – the  League Cup, while McEleney has gathered enough silverware to make any other footballer jealous. With the tide changing at the Brandywell in recent months following theof Ruaidhri Higgins, McEleney is hoping all those statistics can improve. He would oven thing ore than to win wearing the red and white of his home town club. “Whenever I was leaving Derry at the time, I was leaving home,” he said. “It was no secret about how much I loved the club – I still do, I’m a fan and I still go to Derry matches whenever I can – Even playing against them for Dundalk, I’m not going to lie, it was dficult and it was the same the whole time. “I knew at the time I had to make the move, and I’m clever in that sense to know what I need to do, My timing has been pretty good so far, maybe apart from my Oldham move, but you live and you learn. To come down here and play in two Europa League group stages and won what I’ve won, was definitely the right thing to do, and I’m sure % of people would agree with it.” Unexpected McEleney’s final year at Dundalk did not go how anyone expected, with the Lilywhites at one stage looking over their shoulders at relegation, such has been their fall from grace. A new takeover has restored some optimism to the club, but so much damage has been done, proving that in football, success is never guaranteed. “I could sit here all day and explain a million dferent things of what I believed happened, but it is what it is,” McEleney states. “You have to dig deep sometimes and people get things wrong. The players need to look at themselves too. We’re the ones playing and you have to take some responsibility and accountability somewhere. I do anyway. To go from the Europa League group stages to the way it was this year was not good enough and it was a big shock, but we got through it and that was the main thing.” McEleney’s decision to join Derry City was announced in July, and that did not go down well in some quarters, but there was no doubting the player’s focus, and he starred for Dundalk in the weeks that followed, the stand-out performance coming in the two-goal display against Vitesse Arnheim in August. “It was a strange situation but I had to do it for a number of reasons,” he admits. “I think a lot of people were going to question of I was going to down tools. From the outside looking in, it might look asI’m an easy-going guy, and even in the way I play because I can float about, but the people that really know me, know that’s not me. I’m definitely a winner, and I was never going to let anybody question me as a person or question what I was going to do for Dundalk, so it was up to me to put in performances on the pitch in that period of time to make sure no-one would question me. I believe I did that and more.” Goodbye McEleney was given a nice send-off by some fans at training this week, and he is sure to be given a huge ovation tonight. It is the end of an era for both he and his family. “It’s sad,” he admits. “Obviously during the time of it, it can get frustrating and getting the injury it’s hard and you can get yourself down. But now that I’m leaving and I can look back, of course it was amazing what we did, and the success I’ve had here. “I was training and a fan called me over and said ‘Thanks for everything. You were amazing for the club. We’ll not forget the memories and you go with our blessing’. It was just a nice touch and the club has been the same. “I can’t thank them enough, for what they’ve done, not only for me, but for my family. My kids were raised here, so it will always have a place in our family, but everything is in the past now. To be successful you can’t really rest. You can’t say ‘I’ve won this, I’ve won that’. It’s time for new things and to be able to do it for Derry would be beyond dreams so that’s the target now.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

Pic by Seb Daly SportsfileReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Patrick McEleney will bid farewell to Dundalk tonight, but he is still hoping to write more chapters in what has so far been a career of glittering success. googletag.cmd.push Ironically, McEleney will bid his farewells to Oriel Park at the end of the game against his new club and hometown team in Derry City. While the Dundalk fans will be saying goodbye, the travelling City fans will be welcoming home a prodigal son in the same breath. McEleney signed with the Lilywhites in December , as he went on the search for trophies – and in that, he has succeeded. Three league titles,  FAI Cups and  League Cups have all been won in Dundalk colours, and he has been part of two squads who have made it to the Europa League group stages. For all those achievements, he has a thousand more memories scoring against BATE Borislov in the Champions League qualying round, scoring a penalty against Sherf Tiraspol to help Dundalk qualy for the - Europa League group stages, and playing against Arsenal at the Emirates. Any footballer would be proud to look back on all that, but not Patrick. For him the past is the past, and he wants to achieve so much more now that he is ing to Derry City. If anything, he is even hungrier than he was when he left the Brandywell six years ago. “It came full circle,” he agrees. “I’m properly excited to kick on with Derry City and I’m really looking forward to it. I’ve been watching them a lot, especially since I’ve signed and I’ve been trying to pick up things. There are some really good players there which I knew from playing against them anyway. I’m really looking forward to next year and getting my family back home.” “Whenever he contacted me in  he said he really wanted me and he explained how I was going to fit in and how I was going to play. I went down that first year and won the league and got to the Europa League Group Stages and that was surreal to be honest. “Being in that environment I knew there was only one way it was going and we were going to be successful for a lot of years. I was just thankful to Stephen for the opportunity, but I had no doubts in my own ability and what I was going to be able to do for the team. It was amazing times, but it’s gone now, and it’s in the past and it’s time to make new memories.” McEleney did enjoy some success with Derry City after arriving back from Sunderland back in . A part of the squad which win the First Division that year, McEleney went on to win a League Cup in  and the FAI Cup in . Since then, Derry City have won just one trophy – the  League Cup, while McEleney has gathered enough silverware to make any other footballer jealous. With the tide changing at the Brandywell in recent months following theof Ruaidhri Higgins, McEleney is hoping all those statistics can improve. He would oven thing ore than to win wearing the red and white of his home town club. “Whenever I was leaving Derry at the time, I was leaving home,” he said. “It was no secret about how much I loved the club – I still do, I’m a fan and I still go to Derry matches whenever I can – Even playing against them for Dundalk, I’m not going to lie, it was dficult and it was the same the whole time. “I knew at the time I had to make the move, and I’m clever in that sense to know what I need to do, My timing has been pretty good so far, maybe apart from my Oldham move, but you live and you learn. To come down here and play in two Europa League group stages and won what I’ve won, was definitely the right thing to do, and I’m sure % of people would agree with it.” Unexpected McEleney’s final year at Dundalk did not go how anyone expected, with the Lilywhites at one stage looking over their shoulders at relegation, such has been their fall from grace. A new takeover has restored some optimism to the club, but so much damage has been done, proving that in football, success is never guaranteed. “I could sit here all day and explain a million dferent things of what I believed happened, but it is what it is,” McEleney states. “You have to dig deep sometimes and people get things wrong. The players need to look at themselves too. We’re the ones playing and you have to take some responsibility and accountability somewhere. I do anyway. To go from the Europa League group stages to the way it was this year was not good enough and it was a big shock, but we got through it and that was the main thing.” McEleney’s decision to join Derry City was announced in July, and that did not go down well in some quarters, but there was no doubting the player’s focus, and he starred for Dundalk in the weeks that followed, the stand-out performance coming in the two-goal display against Vitesse Arnheim in August. “It was a strange situation but I had to do it for a number of reasons,” he admits. “I think a lot of people were going to question of I was going to down tools. From the outside looking in, it might look asI’m an easy-going guy, and even in the way I play because I can float about, but the people that really know me, know that’s not me. I’m definitely a winner, and I was never going to let anybody question me as a person or question what I was going to do for Dundalk, so it was up to me to put in performances on the pitch in that period of time to make sure no-one would question me. I believe I did that and more.” Goodbye McEleney was given a nice send-off by some fans at training this week, and he is sure to be given a huge ovation tonight. It is the end of an era for both he and his family. “It’s sad,” he admits. “Obviously during the time of it, it can get frustrating and getting the injury it’s hard and you can get yourself down. But now that I’m leaving and I can look back, of course it was amazing what we did, and the success I’ve had here. “I was training and a fan called me over and said ‘Thanks for everything. You were amazing for the club. We’ll not forget the memories and you go with our blessing’. It was just a nice touch and the club has been the same. “I can’t thank them enough, for what they’ve done, not only for me, but for my family. My kids were raised here, so it will always have a place in our family, but everything is in the past now. To be successful you can’t really rest. You can’t say ‘I’ve won this, I’ve won that’. It’s time for new things and to be able to do it for Derry would be beyond dreams so that’s the target now.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Earth Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsTeenager bottled woman in County Derry night club overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Thursday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Geoffrey McGonagle in his Derry days.

We need to consider the needs of all our pupils and their respective futures.Cllr Walker added: ldquoI have met with those for and opposed to the new integrated college proposal and am pleased to have done so as it is the right thing to do.

The races also had dfering start times with the longer distances starting earlier in the day.Doing laps often keeps the runners compact in terms of marshalling and spectating but it can mean that those doing the longer distances are tested mentally when they see others finishing.It is sometimes hard to carry on for the next loop when you can see others reaching the end of their efforts. It also means where there is a hill or a tricky part of the race, you will see it more than onceyou are doing the marathon or the ultra. The k route was slightly separate but also included a few steep sections so it was not an easy option by any means.Marguerite Robinson had been training hard to regain fitness after a layoff with injury and had hoped to be ready to use her half marathon slot, which was a deferred entry from last yearrsquos event, that was called off due to Covid- restrictions.However, as race day approached, she realised that on this occasion that she might be taking on more than she could chew and certainly more than she would enjoy so she wisely switched to the K.She was easy with her decision once the race got underway and even more so during the last mile when she was running the drag uphill from the gate to the finish. She completed in . and was th female .Declan Teague has been in fine marathon form recently, packing in three such races in short succession from September into October, but this one was notable as it got him to number  in his tally.Unfortunately since his last race, he has had to reduce his training miles due to niggles and he arrived at the start line knowing that he was going to have to dig deep to get round.He was therefore delighted to hook up with Phillip Vint as the race got underway and said that the camaraderie took their mind off the big climbs and got them through the first hour with ease.Phillip was on his way to his th marathon and in his usual understated fashion he was just there to get on with it.The commitment and consistency of these guys has to be admired.As much as Declan was enjoying the company, he urged Phillip to press on to pursue his own pace. Phillip very gradually eased away over the miles ahead and finished a superb th overall in three hours and  minutes.This would be a commendable time on tarmac let alone on an off road event. Declan stuck to his own rhythm and was happy with his time of . which placed him nd out of the  who completed.Clare Carson was also in for the marathon distance and taking it in her stride she dipped in just under the five hours to add another one to the long list that she is accumulating.They all commented that they found the downhills as tough as the ups and the quad muscles had definitely taken a battering, but despite the testing route, it is one they will likely repeat.Stephen Heasley, who was in Tollymore to take part in the ultra distance, reported back that he was a lsquoDNFrsquo. For those of you who are unsure what DNF means, it is short for lsquodid not finishrsquo.Most would assume that this would be a major disappointment.In Stephenrsquos case though, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he had a change of plan rather than a failure.Although he was finding it tough going, he waited until the end of lap two to call it a day so in fact he completed a marathon while considering his options.For many of us managing to finish a marathon on a good day would be a challenge. To do so on a ldquobad day seems almost a triumph.It was certainly the right decision for Stephen on the day and hopefully he will now take time for recovery before his next escapade.Jonny Holmes had taken part in the NIMAA XC Championships a month ago as a way of trying his hand at cross country running.That event also stood as selection for the NI team for the North South Challenge.

Bobby Dalzell Cup with a comprehensive victory over local rivals Killough at a windswept Ballyhornan on Friday night.Two goals in each half, including a brace from Celtic striker Jay Gibney, was enough to ensure it would be the Hoops who would be contending for this yearrsquos title on December .To both teams credit, the number of supporters that flooded through the gates to watch this spectacle was more than commendable, with hundreds of people in attendance to witness what is historically a feisty encounter between the sides mdash this occasion being no dferent.Killough, donning their new kit, kicked off, but in a matter of moments found themselves defending a free-kick in a dangerous area, although Celtic centre back Gary Carberry saw his effort well saved by lsquokeeper Christopher Mallon.The opening minutes played out to a rapid pace of football, with the wind unsure of which direction to blow resulting in both teams attempting to play on the ground.Killoughrsquos first big opportunity came courtesy of a Connor Kelly free-kick after team-mate Cillian Burns was pulled down by defender Blaine Connolly unfairly.However, Kellyrsquos effort just whisked over the crossbar in what would prove to be a seldom chance for the village side in the opening  minutes.What Celtic seemed to have in their arsenal which Killough lacked was showing clinical precision and accuracy from their set pieces.With seven minutes on the clock, the Hoops would have their first of  corners throughout the match, with the Killough defence failing to clear the danger with any conviction, allowing the ball to float back across the box and into the path of Celtic marksman Jay Gibney.The striker made no mistake with the finish and the deadlock was broken.Referee James McCreesh certainly had his work cut out, as he consistently gave verbal warnings to both teams and their management as he did a commendable job controlling the pace of the contest.However, his patience was tested one too many times and after a quarter of an hour, Killoughrsquos Kevin Groves received the first yellow card of the game for a tackle on Gerard Collins.Celticrsquos Peter Casey struck the resultant free and was unlucky to see his effort kiss the top of the crossbar.The Hoops continued their pressure and were rewarded with a corner. Barry Treacy, whose set piece efforts were fantastic throughout the  minutes, stepped up to strike a low cross into the box for captain Mikey Rice to tap in and double his sidersquos lead.Rice was instrumental for Celtic and deservedly was awarded man of the match for his efforts.A manic couple of minutes ensued after another corner caused Killough problems, the ball this time falling to Casey who saw his left-footed effort crash off the underside of the crossbar and somehow away to safety.Celtic kept their relentless efforts in attack and a moment later they thought they had their third, but their strike was ruled out for offside. Killough then failed to properly dispatch the ball up the pitch, allowing Hoopsrsquo striker Jordan McCoubrey to attack their goal.However, McCoubrey was left frustrated when his appeal for a penalty was waved off by McCreesh.Killoughrsquos Declan Burns received a booking for a hearty tackle on the opposition before team-mate and lsquokeeper Mallon managed to ert the ball away from the net in a dramatic goal line scramble.In what was an admittedly underwhelming performance by Killough, custodian Mallon made a number of inspiring saves throughout the match and kept the final score at a much more respectable tally.Celticrsquos Casey must have thought he had been the subject of a curse, after his third long ranged effort in the space of  minutes struck the woodwork, this time a spectacular  yard effort thumping against the upper left.Killough managed to weather the storm and their best chance of the half came from captain Gareth Georgersquos free-kick which sailed wide of the post before Celticrsquos Connolly picked up a yellow card for a combination of fouls.That signalled the last signicant action of the opening  as Celtic led by two at the half-time interval.Upon the restart, Shaun Megahey managed to sneak past the Killough backline to force a point blank range save from Mallon as changes were made to both sides, including the introduction of Stephen Galbraith for the Hoops.Carberry was the latest entry into the book after dragging down Killoughrsquos Kelly before the village side suffered an injury blow in the form of midfielder Matt McKiernan on the hour mark.The game had settled down at this point, with Killough still deciding whether to stick or twist as they knew they needed a goal, but one wrong move and the game would be put beyond their reach.Mallon continued to impress in goals, with an eye-catching one handed save off a Carberry header, although at the th minute the result was put beyond doubt.A calamity of errors in the Killough defence allowed Gibney to square the ball to substitute Galbraith, who tapped into the open net to completely crush their opponentsrsquo fighting spirit.Killough are known for their resilience and kept fighting to the conclusion, but it was clear that it wouldnrsquot be their day as the clock wound down.Megahey picked up a yellow for the Hoops before his opponents saw a penalty appeal for a hand ball shut down.Tempers continued to flair as Killoughrsquos Ruairi Sharvin added his name to the list of yellow card recipients just before his sidersquos misery compounded when Gibney added Celticrsquos fourth of the match with a neatly struck finish.Killough resorted to shooting from distance but werenrsquot having much luck, with Jack McLoughlinrsquos effort the only to really cause Celtic custodian Nathan Curran to spring into action with a confident one handed save.Groves did manage to loop a headed effort past Curran. However, as per the theme of the match, Celticrsquos defence managed to clear the ball before it could cross the line.McCreesh blew his whistle for the final time to send the Celtic fans into raptures as the players audibly voiced their pleasure at making yet another final.Man of the match and Hoopsrsquo skipper Mikey Rice gave his thoughts on the performance after the contest.ldquoEveryone knows what theyrsquore getting with Celtic Bhoys and Killough, big hits, hard tackles and a great spectacle for the neutral, he said.ldquoYou see the amount of people who came down here, especially for the Newcastle league teams, itrsquos brilliant. It was always going to be a great game and I respect Killough a lot, he continued.ldquoI think there was a few people here watching the match who will be featuring in next weekrsquos semi-final between Dundrum and Ardglass, so hopefully we gave them a wee bit of fear to face us.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran S Megahey, B Connolly, G Carberry M Rice , G Collins, B Treacy, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, N Williams-McCabe.Subs: C Kerr, S Galbraith, S McMahon, C McCartan.Killough: C Mallon, S Og Burns, G George , E Gargan, R Sharvin, M McKiernan, D Burns, K Groves, C Burns, C Kelly, J McLoughlin.Subs: D Looney, T McIlhone, L Murphy, R Burns, D Taggart.Yellow cards: K Groves, D Burns, R Sharvin.Corners: Celtic Bhoys , Killough .Offsides: Celtic Bhoys , Killough ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/17November2021_castlewellan.jpg","title":"Lease signing paves way for ambitious investment at Castlewellan Forest Park  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have formally approved an agreement which paves the way for a major multi-million pound investment in Castlewellan Forest Park.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Forest Service have signed a draft lease which legally formalises the local authorityrsquos phased takeover of the stunning forest park which attracts tens of thousands of visitors yearly.A pound.m revitalisation project at the park is being backed by the National Lottery Heritage Fund and the local council, with the latter spearheading the ambitious project to signicantly enhance facilities at the sprawling park, with the lottery funding earmarked to restore a number of key features to help maximise its tourism potential.Construction work has already commenced at the Bothy Yard thanks to funding from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the EU.Work on the main restoration project is scheduled to complete by December , with the local authority agreeing a lease for the core areas within the park from the Forest Service until .Proposed work includes new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park, a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park. There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue.Caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.The parkrsquos th century greenhouse is also being restored with the reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames, while one of several outbuildings will be converted to an office and volunteer space.Elsewhere, visitor facilities will be created in the Stove Conservatory including an interpretation centre, with a  lt installed to provide access to the terrance for people with reduced mobility.Agreement on the draft lease came at a recent meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee with the news welcomed by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillors High Gallagher and Laura Devlin.Mr McGrath said plans to signicantly invest in the park will be a ldquogame changer for the South Down area.He said the cocktail of funding which has been secured to finance the revitalisation project will transform the built and natural heritage of the sprawling forest park andact as a huge pull for visitors to the area.Cllr Gallagher said he was delighted that the lease issue had been resolved and that the project was progressing.ldquoAs a Castlewellan councillor, this project is huge and will bring so much benefit to the wider area, he continued.ldquoThis same lease confirmed that the very popular lsquotouring in the treesrsquo permit for touring caravan owners will remain in Forest Service control until the end of .

Mallon eventually pointed in the th minute only for Alana McCrickard to take a pass from Dearbhla Magee and fire over a minute later.Mallon responded with a huge score from play and then a th minute point to level the tie at - eachHowever, Dearbhla Magee gave her side the lead once more with a free after a clever move between Aimee McAleenan and Karen McMullan.But Mallon eventually levelled the tie again with a huge free from  metres in the nd minute and then five minutes from time stepped over a free in the left corner where the m line meets the side-line.It was the toughest angle she had faced, but she scored the point and Portaferry held on for a famous first title.Mallon was the player of the match. Portaferry would not have won without her contribution, having scored all eight points, but they also would not have won without the defensive wall they put in front of Fiona McGarry.Mary Jo Mageean, Dearbhla Coleman and Saoirse Sands smothered everything that the Fontenoys threw at them. But on a day like this, everyone put their shoulder to the wheel and it was enough to break the dam.ldquoIt is very hard to win the first. We have tried very hard over the past few years to win this title and it feels so good to actually get there, said Portaferry team mentor Martin Mallon, who was feeling the relief after the final whistle.ldquoI wonrsquot tell you a lie. We were very anxious coming into this final, all of us. You could see it in our play.Girls were tense and nervous out there and Liatroim took advantage.ldquoThey were always going to give us a real battle and you canrsquot give the likes of Dearbhla Magee an inch. I just donrsquot understand how she didnrsquot get an All-star nomination. She is one of the best players in Ireland, he continued.ldquoI felt thatwe got in front, we wouldnrsquot concede.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Such energy price hikes are both a reflection of inflation and a cause of it. The causes of this are global but there are national and local factors too.There are always calls for yet more government funds to help in these situations, and at times intervention in one form or another, such as altering tax rates, is appropriate. But consider for example the fact that this electricity rise is being in large part blamed on the lack of wind during the summer. Note then that Stormont in its push for emission-free renewables has, like the Republic of Ireland, never so much as considered nuclear power.This is both hypocritical, given the power grids on this island are linked to Great Britain, where much of supply is generated by nuclear, and short sighted, given that nuclear is a non carbon option. This explains why France, which heavily uses nuclear power, has found it easier to reach emission targets than Germany, which is phasing out nuclear.Another factor in the energy price rises is the general inflationary policies pursued in London. However, other causes are entirely outside the control of Stormont or even Westminster.In the long-term, improving home heating efficiencies achieved via better construction and insulation, and ever more efficient vehicle fuel efficiency, will make it easier for families to withstand such periods of high utility bills. But that is cold comfort for households this winter. It is essential that when underlying price fundamentals change, these are promptly passed on to users.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Quite a surprise, then, that the Irish government has now discovered an alternative in the case of solid fuel, where imports from the north will be allowed in over the land border without let or hindrance and will only be checked at sites further into the territory of the Republic, well away from the actual customs border .But beyond that particular case, a former Irish diplomat, Rory Montgomery, has revealed that after the  Brexit referendum the Irish government was actively considering similar alternative arrangements for checking and controlling all of the trickle of goods crossing the border, until the EU insisted that despite the very special circumstances EU law must be rigidly applied as per normal.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Earlier this week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he was “keeping an open mind” on the proposals.On Wednesday evening, a majority on the Stormont Executive agreed to plans to roll out a mandatory vaccine passport, with the DUP ministers voting against.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

When they are excluded I will be with them.”Around the same time, Pam Cameron tweeted: “Mine has been ready to go for some time now! No one likes any of these measures. I understand that a negative test proof of immunity will also be acceptable.“I would encourage those who can take a vaccine to avail of that protection #COVIDCertNI.”On Thursday, Mr Frew continued to voice his opposition to the certication.He tweeted: “It’s important that everyone fighting against discriminatory vaccine certication remains peaceful  respectful against this wrong.“We warned what a ‘them and us society‘ looked like, we were right, keep your head up, stay measured. we are right to fight against discrimination.”In another Twitter message, he said: “Contact all your MLAs... at this point make your feelings known.“here have been a number of protests organised also which can help people display displeasure at this measure.”When asked why the DUP had not exercised a veto on the vaccine passport proposal, Mr Frew replied: “Will find out at our next group meeting. Party should make statement on this.”On the BBC’s Nolan Show on Thursday morning, South Down MLA Jim Wells declined to endorse Pam Cameron.Askedhe “rated” his DUP assembly colleague, Mr Wells said: “No comment. The reason I say that is, undoubtedly you are bound to say something that Pam has said. What is it ”The show’s host Stephen Nolan referred to Ms Cameron’s Covid vaccine certicate tweet, and suggested to Mr Wells that his party was “all over the place” and giving out “mixed messages in the middle of a pandemic”.Mr Wells replied: “Pam has the right in a democratic society to make that comment, and I have a right to say that I haven’t taken the vaccine, and you know why I haven’t taken the vaccine.“There are many thousands like me in the Province who have made the same decision. We have the same right as Pam has.”Mr Wells added: “She has taken it, I haven’t, that’s our right, and in any society that forces you to do anything dferent, then you are into a North Korean situation which is absolutely unacceptable in a western democracy.”On Wednesday, DUP MP Sammy Wilson Sammy Wilson suggested that his party could yet block the move to make vaccine passports mandatory in Northern Ireland.He said it was a “bad decision” that was “made in haste”.

The best thing I did was talk about it.MORE NEWS:The animated film explains what its like to live with the condition and reveals the wide iety of hallucinations Mr Foy experiences every day,including seeing his daughterrsquos plaits as wiggling fish out of water when she moves, or seeing a dragon when he opens a hot oven.Mr Foy has a guide dog called Mason, who he says keeps him safe and grounded.In , the retina in his left eye detached and, while he experienced some hallucinations as a teenager, they then increased dramatically and his brain would conjure all sorts of visions to fill the darkness..removeMr Foy said: ldquoI hope that this film will raise awareness of Charles Bonnet Syndrome and also encourage others with the condition to reach out to Guide Dogs for support.Ian Morris, national head of adult services at Guide Dogs, said: ldquoDespite so many people with sight loss experiencing Charles Bonnet Syndrome, there is very little awareness or understanding.ldquoIt is thought that the hallucinations are the brainrsquos response to the gradual loss of information it received from the eyes and so is trying to fill in the gaps, therefore drawing comparisons with lsquophantom limb syndromersquo in amputees.ldquoAt Guide Dogs, our mission is to increase the independence of people with sight loss. We hope that by sharing Nathanrsquos experience in the form of this animation, we can raise awareness of the condition and reduce stigma, and let people know of the support available from Guide Dogs.If you require more information or help from Guide Dogs, you can contact them on the Guide Line telephone service on    or visit https:www.guidedogs.org.uk getting-support Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityHere we break down how Cardf and Vale University Health Board has performed in October .Ambulance response timesCardf and Vale had the highest emergency response rates in October according to the latest Welsh Government NHS Wales Performance data.For the health board,  lsquoredrsquo calls ndash calls which are for immediately le-threatening incidents ndash were received in October, with an emergency response sent out in  of these cases.Of these,  were at the scene to treat the patient within the Welsh Governmentrsquos eight-minute target. This was . per cent of those lsquoredrsquo calls being attended to in the response time - making Cardf and Vale the only health board in Wales to meet the  per cent target.The health board also received, amber - less urgent but still serious - calls and , green calls - cases where a non-emergency response is more appropriate..This October saw the highest number of calls for an ambulance than any other October since the May  period when the data was first made available. It was also the firth month in a row where the daily lsquoredrsquo call average was above  ndash with an average of  lsquoredrsquo calls last month.The Wales-wide statistics report that just  per cent of lsquoredrsquo calls received a response time within eight minutes ndash the lowest since the data was first made available in May . It is down . per cent on September.Darren Hughes, director of the Welsh NHS Confederation, said: ldquoThe pressures the NHS are currently facing, particularly in urgent and emergency care, are worrying for all. Recent figures show the impact that the enormous pressures on the NHS are having on ambulance waits outside of Emergency Departments and how this effects the experience of patients..removeldquoItrsquos important to understand that this is a whole-system issue. There are many factors affecting NHS capacity from staff absences because of Covid or suspected Covid, to more people on wards and in intensive care units needing treatment for Covid and higher demand for other conditions. The social care system is also under unprecedented pressure, meaning the NHS is unable to discharge patients from hospital and therefore has much lower capacity to treat incoming patients.ldquoThe NHS in Wales is working relentlessly to cope with current levels of demand and staff are doing all they can to ensure everyone waiting for care is seen as soon as possible. We thank them and the public for doing all they can to support the NHS.A spokesperson for the Welsh Government said: ldquoThe latest data shows the pressure on our health and care system continues to grow. But our hardworking health and social care staff continue to deliver high quality care when people need it.On the ambulance waits, the spokesperson said: ldquoThe ambulance service in Wales, like the rest of the UK, continues to be under great strain. The number of red calls, which are classed as le-threatening, in October were the highest ever on record. The number of calls in October were also  per cent higher than October last year.ldquoEarlier this year we provided an additional pound million to go towards supporting the transformation of urgent and emergency care services to deliver the right care in the right place, first time.ldquoThe ambulance service has also received funding for the recruitment of the equivalent of  staff.ldquoWe encourage people to consider the best options for care, and not necessarily head to their local emergency department. To get the right care first time, people can also use the online  service and their local pharmacist where appropriate.Emergency Department dataThe figures show , people attended the emergency department at University Hospital of Wales Cardf in October. Of these , - or . per cent - were seen within the four hour target. This puts the health board in the middle of the Welsh statistics.The latest data shows that there were,attendances to all NHS Wales emergency departments in October . This was: . per centlower than the previous month , . per centhigher than in the same month last yearbut . per centlowerthan October .MORE NEWS:The average number of emergency department attendances per day in October  was ,. This was:  fewer attendances per day on average than in the previous month,  more than in the same month in  but  fewer than in October .According to Welsh Government targets,  per cent of patients should spend less than four hours at an emergency department.The latest monthrsquos data shows that . per centof patients in all NHS emergency departments spent less than fourhours in the department from arrival until admission, transfer or discharge. This was: . per cent lower than the previous month, . per cent lower than the same month in , and . per cent lower than the same month in . The  per centtarget continues to be missed.Cancer treatment timesThe Cardf and Vale University Health Board is the third lowest health board in Wales for patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment within the first  days after diagnosis.In total  patients in the health board started their first treatment in the month of September, with  within the first  days of being suspected of having cancer. The total percentage is . per cent of patients starting their first treatment within  days. However this, and all of the health boards in Wales, falls below the target of  per cent.Prior to the Covid- pandemic, on average there were just under , patients starting their first definitive treatment per month. This number fell at the start of the pandemic to a low point of  in May  but has generally been on an upward trend since and in recent months has been in-line with or exceeded activity levels for the corresponding months in .In September , , patients newly diagnosed with cancer started their first definitive treatment in the month.This is an increase of . per centfrom August  and an increase of . per centfrom September .The Welsh Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is encouraging the number of patients newly diagnosed with cancer starting their first definitive treatment and the number of patients informed they did not have cancer have both increased on the previous month.ldquoIn a boost to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, the health minister today announced more than pound million is to be invested in replacing ageing diagnostic imaging equipment across NHS Wales.ldquoThis will signicantly improve image quality, often resulting in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.ldquoWe have invested an extra pound million this year to transform the delivery of services and tackle waiting times, but because of the ongoing pressures and effects of the pandemic we donrsquot expect to see real progress before the spring. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

A motion to ban MPs from holding second jobs outside parliament as paid lobbyists or political consultants has failed. MPs voted by a majority of  votes to reject the motion which had been put forward by the Labour Party following the recent Tory sleaze row and the government’s handling of the Owen Paterson case. Boris Johnson had instructed his MPs to vote against the Labour motion, with a following Conservative amendment passing through a majority of  votes. Labour leader Keir Starmer announced that the party would be tabling a motion to call for a ban on MPs being able to hold “any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant”. It came after huge backlash over the Owen Paterson row and the accusation that the Conservative government had ed to a policy of “sleaze”. Johnson had previously instructed Tory MPs to vote against the immediate suspension of former MP Owen Paterson, who had been found by the parliamentary standards committee to have broken lobbying rules while working as a consultant and earning £, per year. The committee had recommended that Paterson serve a -day suspension, however his suspension was initially blocked after a vote in the House of Commons, where a reform of the parliamentary standards committee was also voted through. The government was forced to do a hard u-turn on blocking Paterson’s suspension following intense backlash from opposition parties and the public, with critics claiming that the incident had heralded ato “Tory sleaze”. As a result of the incident, Labour took the opportunity to table a motion which banned the paid employment of MPs in positions consultancy and advisory role outside of parliament. At a vote in the House of Commons on  November, the motion was rejected by  votes to . Despite rejecting the motion with a majority of  votes, the vote showed that Boris Johnson’s majority on the issue had decreased. Many Tory MPs abstained from voting against the controversial motion, while four Conservative MPs - Peter Bone, Philip Hollobone, Nigel Mills and Dan Poulter - rebelled against the party and voted in favour of the ban on certain kinds of second jobs. Upon the announcement that a Labour backed motion calling for a ban on paid lobbying and consultancy role for MP would be tabled, Johnson tabled an amendment. The amendment described the ban as “the basis of a viable approach” and called on the Standards Committee to update the MPs’ Code of Conduct. Labour called the motion a “watered down” version of the original amendment. Despite the original motion being rejected, the amendment passed with  votes to zero, with Labour MPs abstaining from the second vote. A Government spokesperson said: “The House of Commons has tonight voted to update the Code of Conduct for MPs.“This means that MPs will be banned from acting as paid political consultants or lobbyists and that MPs are always prioritising their constituents.“This will strengthen our parliamentary system and we will work on a cross-party basis to achieve this.”Following the vote and rejection of the Labour motion, Starmer said: “We put forward a plan of action to clean up politics and strengthen standards in politics.“Andyou can believe it, after two weeks of Tory sleaze and corruption, the Prime Minister whipped his MPs against that plan of action, and, frankly, he just doesn’t get.”“We are not going to back down from these proposals, we’re not prepared to have them watered down, so we will press on with them.“But it is unbelievable.”"},{"url":null,"title":"junior reporter needed to interview the fureys ","story":"MPs back government’s ‘watered down’ plans on second jobs last seen in Craigavon area\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people ethan-carville-missing-boy--last-seen-in-craigavon-area- itm_sourceparsely-api\" data-el\"right\" data-s-el\"right\" data-direction\"right\"    last seen in Craigavon area\" href\"https:www.portadowntimes news people ethan-carville-missing-boy--last-seen-in-craigavon-area- itm_sourceparsely-api\" data-el\"left\" data-s-el\"right\" data-direction\"right\"Ethan Carville: Missing boylast seen in Craigavon areaNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoHomes and GardensLestyleCarsHomes and GardensPublic NoticesAdvertise My BusinessFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleJunior reporter needed to interview The FureysWe’re on the lookout for a junior reporter interested in the unique assignment of interviewing members of top Irish folk band, The Fureys.By Valerie MartinMonday, th November , : am  \"       \"  The Fureys, will be performing at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Saturday, January  and in advance of this showpiece event, we are giving one young person a unique opportunity to interview Eddie and George Furey from the band.The interview will take place at the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Monday, December .

The Executive today backed proposals to introduce vaccine passports. Its believed they will be needed to enter nightclubs, hospitality venues which serve food and drink cinemas, theatres, concert halls and conference centres indoor events with  or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated outdoor events with , or more attendees with some or all of the audience not normally seated and events where more than , people will be present regardless of whether they are seated. All of the Executive parties, with the exception of the DUP, backed the proposals. Welcoming the Executive’s decision to introduce Covid certication for hospitality settings, the Minister said: “Certication must be seen as one piece in a jigsaw of required measures. Other measures include signicantly increased use of face coverings, more people working from home and more social distancing. We need to limit our contacts and always be mindful of the importance of fresh air and good ventilation in dispersing Covid- particles. “We also need to continue the acceleration of our vaccine booster roll-out, and keep encouraging more people to come forward for their first and second doses. “The case for Covid certication in hospitality is not complicated. It can reduce the number of infected people in high risk settings. Vaccinated people are less likely to become infected and ill than unvaccinated people. And the virus is only transmitted by infected people. “Our Covid numbers are too high and we need to forcibly push them down. Our health and social care system is under severe stress. We have to act. “Let me also emphasise that I do not want to see further Covid restrictions on our economy or our daily lives. Such a decision is far from inevitable. “We can all play our part in altering the direction of this pandemic. It is in all our hands. “By following public health advice we can help keep each other safe and support our health workers. “We all want this pandemic to be over, but simply wishing it away is never going to be enough. A united effort across society is what is needed to get us through this winter.” Covid certication requires proof of full vaccination status, or a negative Lateral Flow Test in the previous  hours, or proof of recovery from a positive PCR test in the previous  –  days.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_acecbaabfcdaba   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cbadcffef   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1637251036284.jpg--covid_19___thu_18th_november_figures.jpg?163725103700","title":"covid  thu th november figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows six further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.
