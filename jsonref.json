[{"url":null,"title":"Third Israeli election looks prolong political stalemate","story":"Share this article \u0027There are only three reasons for this election - bribery, fraud and breach of trust,\u0027 a reference to the corruption charges dogging the embattled PM.Following the Sept 17 vote, Netanyahu\u0027s Likud party and the rival Blue and White, led by former military commander Gantz, both failed to cobble together a governing coalition.  Both men had insisted they want to avoid another costly election campaign. And together, their parties control a solid majority in the 120-seat Knesset.But neither was willing to compromise on their core demands for a unity government.Netanyahu insisted on serving as prime minister, where he is best positioned to fight his corruption charges. Gantz has refused to serve under a prime minister with such serious legal problems and called on Likud to choose a different leader.Hours before the deadline, parliament took an initial step to dissolve itself on its own.         Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz, left, Esther Hayut, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Israel, center, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attend a memorial service for former President Shimon Peres in JerusalemBut as speeches and committee work stretched into the night, the lawmakers managed to pass only one of three required readings of the bill on time by a 91-0 margin.Even after the deadline automatically dissolved parliament, lawmakers worked throughout the night to finalize the March 2 election date.Given the isions in Israeli society, and the deep mistrust between the opposing camps, there appears to be little hope that another vote will break the loop of elections and instability that has rocked the country for the past year. The recent campaigns have been characterized by mudslinging and accusations that Netanyahu has incited against the country´s Arab minority.Netanyahu did not participate in the late-night parliamentary debate. But in a video on social media, he accused Gantz of courting Arab \u0027terror supporters\u0027 and forcing new elections. \u0027In order to prevent this happening again, there is only one thing we must do: win and win big,\u0027 he said.The upcoming campaign is expected to cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars and continue the paralysis until the middle of next year. With limited authority, a string of caretaker governments over the past year have frozen major legislation, key appointments, long-term planning and budgets for the military and important government ministries.         Netanyahu is desperately clinging to power to wage his legal battle from the favorable perch of prime ministerBut for Netanyahu, the country´s longest-ever serving leader, a new campaign offers a much-needed lifeline.Netanyahu is desperately clinging to power to wage his legal battle from the favorable perch of prime minister. Israeli law does not require a sitting prime minister to resign if charged with a crime.Netanyahu can now use his office in the coming months as a bully pulpit to continue his attacks on prosecutors and police investigators, whom he has accused of staging an \u0027attempted coup\u0027 against him.Without a functioning parliament in place, Netanyahu can also put on hold his expected request for immunity from prosecution.The outgoing parliament did not have a majority in favor of granting him immunity. Netanyahu can now hope that the next election delivers him a more favorable result. Netanyahu\u0027s trial is on hold until the immunity issue is resolved, a process that is expected to take months.After the March election, he also could use coalition negotiations as leverage to push potential partners to support his immunity request.Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said that being in the prime minister\u0027s post during these negotiations is a huge advantage. \u0027Because then one can trade politically important Cabinet portfolios and so on in return for support for the immunity,\u0027 he said.Netanyah\u0027s first immediate challenge will be to fend off an insurrection inside Likud. The party announced Wednesday that it will hold a leadership primary on Dec. 26.One renegade lawmaker, Gideon Saar, has already said he will challenge Netanyahu, though the prime minister remains popular in the party and appears to have a solid edge.Netanyahu could also face new legal questions. Although he is currently not required to step down, Israeli law is unclear about whether he could be given the authority to form a new government after the next election.Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit, who was criticized for his slow decision making before he indicted Netanyahu, will now have to rule on that question as well.Even if Netanyahu overcomes these challenges, polls indicate that he will not be able to muster a majority in favor of granting him immunity or forming a coalition government.Maverick politician Avigdor Lieberman, a former Netanyahu ally, has turned into the prime minister´s greatest nemesis.Lieberman served in a string of Netanyahu governments, but then abruptly resigned as defense minister last December to protest what he thought were weak policies toward Gaza militants.That resignation pushed the country into its current predicament, setting the stage for inconclusive elections in April and then in September.Refusing to endorse either Netanyahu or Gantz, Lieberman has repeatedly called on them to form a broad secular unity government. But with all three leaders refusing to bend, a new election may not be able to break the deadlock.Lieberman said the two big parties were responsible for what he called \u0027unnecessary\u0027 elections. \u0027Neither Likud nor Blue and White wanted a unity government,\u0027 he said."},{"url":null,"title":"John McDonnell claims Labour momentum going election","story":"Share this articleShare this article            Mr Johnson appeared to be in good spirits during the campaign stop despite opinion polls suggesting that the race for Number 10 is getting tighterOn a visit to JCB\u0027s factory in Staffordshire yesterday, he hammered home his message that the Tories need a Commons majority so they can \u0027send in the bulldozers\u0027 and \u0027smash through the Brexit gridlock\u0027. To emphasise this, he drove a digger with a \u0027Get Brexit Done\u0027 sign in its bucket through a wall marked \u0027Gridlock\u0027.Mr Johnson urged his party not be complacent as he told supporters to remember the 2017 election, when polls predicted victory but Theresa May lost her majority.Asked by the Daily Mail if he was \u0027home and dry\u0027 for an election win, the Prime Minister replied: \u0027Absolutely not.

In February he said: \u0027We could make sure that 0.7 per cent is spent more in line with Britain\u0027s political commercial and diplomatic interests.\u0027         Britain\u0027s foreign aid department could be axed if Boris Johnson wins the general election. Pictured: Mr Johnson in Manchester yesterdayTory sources yesterday suggested that the idea of folding into the foreign office into the Foreign Office was \u0027speculation\u0027.But a Government official told the Financial Times: \u0027There is thinking going on about it. We want things to work better overseas. This shake-up could be positive.\u0027Some Dfid officials believe the move could be a pretext for cutting the aid budget. The Tories have previously suggested expanding the definition of aid to include spending on diplomatic and military missionsOne Dfid source said staff would resign if there was any attempt to scrap the department or change its priorities. The move would also require a change in the law, which requires the government to adhere to aid rules set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Officials point out that the Foreign Office already spends some aid cash and has faced fierce criticism over projects such as grants to the Chinese film industry.One Dfid source said: \u0027The Foreign Office spends 10 per cent of the money and causes 90 per cent of the controversy.\u0027Mr Johnson is expected to conduct only a minor reshuffle if he wins this week. However, he is drawing up plans for a major shake-up after Britain leaves the EU.          Officials point out that the Foreign Office (pictured) already spends some aid cash and has faced fierce criticism over projects such as grants to the Chinese film industry"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Andrews Pitch Palace event moved Buckingham Palace hotel Duke not invited","story":"Share this article Tonight\u0027s event is called \u0027Meet the Entrepreneurs\u0027 and sees them pitching ideas to experts. Investors are reported to have received a text from the Duke\u0027s private secretary Amanda Thirsk saying the venue had changed at the last minute. She claimed it was due to the General Election tomorrow. Buckingham Palace has not commented.  Andrew agreed to withdraw from public duty but initially wanted to remain a figurehead for Pitch@Palace, some 200 charities and other affiliations.          Tonight is the organisation\u0027s first event since the Duke of York was grilled on his relationship with convicted US paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (mugshot pictured) At the end of his disastrous interview with Emily Maitlis he said he planned to continue with Pitch@Palace and his other business schemes.  But he was forced to back down afters several sponsors made it clear they no longer wanted his backing.The organisation is believed to be dropping \u0027Palace\u0027 from its name.  At least 23 organisations have either dropped the Duke or accepted his resignation, including the English National Ballet, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Outward Bound Trust. In the immediate fallout, one of the country\u0027s leading accountancy firms, KPMG, revealed it had stopped sponsoring Pitch@Palace to protect its reputation.KPMG bosses decided to end the relationship last month due to \u0027unsavoury\u0027 issues stemming from the Duke\u0027s friendship with Epstein. The firm was a founding partner and had paid up to £100,000 a year in sponsorship since 2014.  Several other major companies and charities said they were also considering their links with Andrew in the wake of his extraordinary television interview about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.The pharmaceutical giant Astrazeneca said it was reviewing its relationship with Pitch@Palace, while insurance firm Aon asked for its name be removed from the scheme\u0027s website. Aon sources insisted that the company is not associated with the Duke\u0027s scheme and that the supposed relationship had been publicised in error.                  At the end of his disastrous interview with Emily Maitlis he said he planned to continue with Pitch@Palace and his other business schemesPrince Andrew\u0027s Pitch@Palace event to be moved from royal residence to hotel in wake of Epstein interview"},{"url":null,"title":"Inline skaters cruise London street ends abruptly car door opens","story":"Share this article Spotting a lorry in his path, he makes a beeline for the pavement.But, as Mr Tierney moves alongside a car its door abruptly opens.

I just talked and talked. It was wonderful.’In addition to the scores of television programmes, he wrote more than 45 books, and starred in a Ribena commercial.He also had a Top 40 hit with Brontosaurus, Will You Wait For Me? and appeared on Jim’ll Fix It.

In 1996 he let rip against wind farms (‘because they don’t work’) during one of his regular appearances on Blue Peter: ‘That was the beginning really. From that moment, I was not welcome at the BBC.’The killer blow came when he was dropped by The Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, of which he was president and with whom he had worked for more than 50 years. They didn’t even tell him —he read about it in the newspapers.It was no surprise that he became sceptical of many of the conservation groups he had once enthusiastically endorsed.‘The World Wildlife Fund might have saved a few pandas, but what about the forests? What have Greenpeace done?,’ he railed in one interview.

In 1979 he won Bafta’s Richard Dimbleby Award.At his peak, he was one of the most respected and sought-after experts in his field and although his ban from TV screens saddened him, he wasn’t bitter.‘When I was at the BBC, I could do whatever I wanted. In those days, you could say what you liked. You can’t now. The world’s gone bonkers,’ he said.

So we adopted the next four, from all round the world, and they’re wonderful.’His wife Rosemary — who died last year — was his rock, the love of his life. They met when he was just 17 and were married 60 years.She was also very understanding of her husband’s interests. They had 32 different species of pet, including a crocodile. ‘I brought it back from Australia — you couldn’t do that now.’And he had no regrets.He told the Mail: ‘I’m the world’s luckiest man — I‘ve stood on top of the world and I married a wonderful woman.’He also inspired a generation with his love of the natural world.

But naturally all anyone can talk about is the guy who taped a $120,000 banana to the wall and the other guy who ate it.The initial piece, Comedian by the Italian-born artist Maurizio Cattelan, and the subsequent performanceaction, Hungry Artist by Georgian-born David Datuna, may seem too ludicrous to even parody, but all parties are making a good show of taking the matter seriously. In its pre-masticated form, Cattelan claimed that he worked on Comedian for a year, before deciding on exactly how to let the banana manifest itself. (In earlier conceptions, it was made of resin, before the sculptor realized “the banana is supposed to be a banana”.) Gallerist Emmanuel Perrotin explained that the angle of the tape and shape of the fruit were “carefully considered”.While Cattelan certainly has an impish sense of humor, he isn’t someone who barged on to the scene with a bag of groceries. He has had a long career pushing boundaries that include golden toilets (yes, the one recently stolen from Blenheim Palace was his), taxidermy, waxworks of John F Kennedy, the pope and Hitler, and large sculptures of extended middle fingers. When the banana was taped to the wall, it quickly sold for $120,000, followed by another. A third was up for bid to a museum at $150,000 before David Datuna hit the Miami Beach convention center.Datuna is not just another prankster looking for a potassium fix. He proudly tells me via telephone that he is one of only two artists to have had shows at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery while still alive. His mixed-media sculptures often include eyeglasses as a motif, and in recent years he has done site-specific political work, such as laying out blocks of ice to spell Trump in New York’s Union Square, which would later melt. (This action was inspired by the withdrawal from the Paris agreement.) In 2022 in Qatar, timed for the World Cup, he is planning, as he calls it, the largest art installation incorporating artificial intelligence that has ever happened.There was near pandemonium from selfie-takers around Comedian in Miami, and when Datuna saw it (and saw it was from Cattelan) he thought it was great. But when he Googled it and saw the asking price it took “about 15 or 20 minutes” to conceive of “the answer I must give to him and to the art world”.“Warhol put banana on a canvas,” Datuna says with his Georgian accent. “Cattelan takes a real banana and puts it on the wall. David took banana from the wall and ate it!”Datuna called his performance piece Hungry Artist and it quickly went viral. He did not have permission from Cattelan or the Perrotin Gallery.Below is a further transcript of our phone conversation, edited for clarity.Have you met Maurizio Cattelan?No, but I follow him, he is a great artist.Has he reached out to you since this past weekend?It’s plausible you will meet him some day on the contemporary art circuit, though. Would it be a warm meeting?I would love to meet him. I think he is a genius. Art is about comedy, about fun, about tragedy, about emotions. He played this very well. I love the banana of Andy Warhol, but I think Cattelan has put the banana on a different level.What I don’t like, however, is that a banana costs 20 cents. I think it is a good idea to put it in a museum if it is free to watch. But when you sell it for $120,000? Then decide to make a second and third edition, and that third edition is $150,000? It is silly, and not good for our contemporary life.I have travelled in 67 countries around the world in the last three years, and I see how people live. Millions are dying without food. Then he puts three bananas on the wall for half a million dollars?So you felt compelled to do something?Cattelan beat Andy Warhol. Maybe I shouldn’t say beat, but brought it to another level. I began to think: “What can I do with this banana? How can I bring it to yet another level?” And how to do it also with comedy? So I ate the banana. It is something deeper.It’s like the story of Picasso and Modigliani, when they were having problems. Modigliani’s girlfriend gave Picasso some pieces and in the next week or two they had a group exhibition and what happened was Picasso painted his art on top of Modigliani’s art. He just left small pieces that you could recognize as Modigliani but it was Picasso. This is the same thing what happens now, but in a concept. Concept gets another concept.Do you eat a lot of bananas?About once a year. I do not really like them.If you could tell Maurizio “next time, put this kind of fruit on the wall” what would you choose?Next time Maurizio won’t put any fruit on a wall. Go on the internet now and you see everyone is doing this now. But I am no banana eater.The gallery owner stressed that without an artist’s certificate, the banana just reverts to being a regular banana. Do you subscribe to this theory of artistic transubstantiation?This has happened before, with Damien Hirst’s sharks that needed to be replaced. It is the idea that is important.I hate to be vulgar, but it is a part of life: everything one eats eventually leaves the body. Did you feel a sense of artistic fulfillment when the banana left your body?I felt, in my body, not part of the banana, but part of Maurizio."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b0cc8ead288abdf7a6f5d5b7168d9213f18d5c6/0_182_3687_2212/master/3687.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a04488bde3164d3bfb170e1af731953d","title":"patti smith easter lynn goldsmith best photograph","story":"‘When she started putting her poetry to rock’n’roll, Patti Smith was electric. So I always chose colours – yellow, red, blue – that punctuated that aspect of her’ It was 1977 and I was shooting Patti Smith for the cover of her album Easter. I was thinking a lot about Dante Gabriel Rossetti and the palette he uses in his painting The Annunciation: white for purity, red for the blood of Christ, blue for the heavens.Patti brought the white dress, which had been given to her by Robert Mapplethorpe. She brought the red scarf too – she still has it. And one of us threw in the feathers. The blue background is pretty much the exact blue in the Rossetti. That’s not what makes Patti’s eyes pop though. She has Elizabeth Taylor eyes. They always pop.Patti has talked about how I brought her into the world of colour. Prior to me, any photographer she worked with had always shot her in black and white – even Robert, who was her lover, and before that Judy Linn. But when she started putting her poetry to rock’n’roll, Patti’s being was electric. Even now, at 72, she electrifies people. So I always chose colours – bright yellow, red, this blue, lime green – that punctuated that aspect of her.If you know the album, you’ll know this isn’t the image we went with. During the shoot – against a different, brown background – Patti lifted up her arms. Easter was the album she worked on after she broke her neck and went through a very painful recovery. To be able to lift her arms in that way was like a resurrection of her spirit. So that’s the one we went with.Sometimes on a shoot I might say, “Move to the left” or something like that, but with Patti you don’t really need to pull anything out of her. She’s a performance artist. She gets it. There is always a need to talk, but with Patti I can work in a quieter fashion than when I photograph someone for the first time. Then, it’s all about gaining their trust – when I look through my lens, I can see in their eyes whether they’re scared or questioning what I want.People tend to limit me to “music photographer” but I’ve done everything from covers of Sports Illustrated and shoots for National Geographic to fine art with dolls and a book of self-portraits. I write songs too – in the UK, I’m known as Will Powers. I haven’t put new music out for some time, but in 1983 I had a lot of success with a single called Kissing with Confidence. So if people want to see me as a rock’n’roll photographer, or some famous person’s friend, I just think they’re limiting themselves, not me.It’s the same thing with Patti. If you go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and there’s a drawing exhibition on, there might be a Patti Smith next to a Picasso. People don’t really talk about that or how she’s also an accomplished photographer and the writer of 15 books of poetry, as well as memoirs. If they want to call her the godmother of punk, she’ll take it, but is that really all she is? I don’t think so.When I’m asked to do an album cover, I always want to hear it first. In some cases, the artist might not have done a full mix, might not have put down the vocals – and they’ll just offer to sing it to me, to my face, which can be great but also a little uncomfortable.Patti likes to sing. She sings all the time. She sings when she walks up the stairs. We’ll sing lines together like: “Goin’ to the chapel and we’re goin’ to get married” or “Remember walking in the sand”. Patti is fierce, authentic, complex. She is a poet, in everything she does. I feel blessed to have a friend like her – and that’s what I see when I look at this image.Influences: “My mother, Joseph Campbell, Bob Dylan, Guy Bourdin, Jean Renoir, Francois Truffaut, Federico Fellini, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix.”Highlow point: “I don’t believe in highs and lows.”Top tip: “Keep working.

We need to see other companies follow in Lloyd’s of London’s footsteps and introduce more inclusive policies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff188aa341b35d7eb5af69325971d8ad6decef3/0_154_3860_2316/master/3860.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32792f93a7bc6c6de6f5a613fa57cb45","title":"bt to launch monthly pass sport content first time flexibility","story":"Firm acknowledges consumers’ preference for Netflix-type flexibility over long-term dealsBT is to launch a monthly pass allowing sport fans to watch content including Premier League and Champions League football without a contract for the first time, as viewers move away from high-priced, long-term deals towards the flexibility offered by streaming services such as Amazon and Netflix.BT has previously used its portfolio of rights, including Premiership Rugby, boxing and wrestling, as a carrot to lock consumers into contracts for broadband, phone and TV services.The new £25-a-month pass allows anyone to dip in and out of BT Sport without having to pay hundreds of pounds over an annual contract.Richard Broughton, an analyst at the media consultancy Ampere, said: “There is an increasing expectation in the market for flexibility, with long contract periods now off-putting to many consumers. It is also a nod to how competitive the market is getting.”Last week, Amazon successfully livestreamed its first 10 Premier League matches. The matches were accessible to subscribers to Amazon’s Prime service, which costs £7.99 a month or £79 a year, or were free to new customers on a 30-day trial. Amazon has said the two days on which matches were streamed set new records for the most signups to Prime since it was launched in the UK in 2007.Pete Oliver, the managing director of marketing at BT Consumer, said: “Customers can sign up on a flexible monthly basis for the first time.“Monthly pass forms part of BT’s ambition to offer BT Sport customers unrivalled choice and the highest-quality broadcasts on even more devices and platforms.”Sky began offering sport and entertainment on a pay-as-you-go basis seven years ago through its streaming service Now TV. The broadcaster has a range of daily, weekly and monthly passes without the need for a Sky TV subscription.Sky’s monthly sports pass is priced at £33.99. Offering a monthly pass has not resulted in a rush of cancellations by its core pay-TV base of about 10 million subscribers instead, it has primarily attracted a new set of “pay-lite” customers.Broughton said: “It is more risky offering sports monthly than film and TV content, because the timing of events opens the door to viewers waiting just for specific matches and then churning.“Given the high price of sports rights, it is a risky bet. Sky’s Now TV has mitigated the risk of contract customers moving to a ‘dip in and dip out’ culture by pricing the sports pass quite high in recognition that consumers have to pay for flexibility.”Netflix and Amazon have swiftly attracted 20 million UK subscribers between them. Last year, the number of subscribers to streaming services overtook those signed up to pay-TV providers such as Sky, BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media for the first time.Monthly cost of streaming services and pay-TV passesSky Sports pass – £33.99, reduced to £20 for the first two monthsAmazon Prime Video – £7.99, or £79 a year (includes fast delivery, music streaming and other Prime member benefits)BBC TV licence – £12.90 or £154.50 annually"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/84a93817e00877a52ddd250f6535134bc56d1cc1/0_139_4522_2713/master/4522.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44def3c3dc37925d5a98433a74a82f97","title":"christine lagarde ecb meeting rates aramco ftse business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsBoom!

This forced them to dial back the IPO, float locally, and pitch it mainly at local investors.Christine Lagarde could help the ‘green finance’ movement today, by signalling that the ECB will do more to fight the climate emergency.Environmental activists are demanding action -- on Lagarde’s first day, they marched outside the ECB’s headquarters with a banner that read “if the Earth was a bank you’d have rescued it”. One option is to buy more green bonds -- although that runs a risk of distorting the overall (too small) market.Into the breach, the political, social and economic zeitgeist appears to have presented green bonds an opportunity to play a meaningful role in policy. Whether it’s the US Democrats’ left wing pushing a Green New Deal, or President Lagarde orienting the ECB towards a role in combatting global warming, green bonds represent an attractive fiscal option, particularly in the eurozone. Christine Lagarde will also release the ECB’s latest economic forecasts today.They are likely to predict slow growth and weak inflation, meaning no pressure to change policy today.Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank expects a cautious debut:Staff forecasts for GDP growth, headline inflation and core inflation are likely to be stable for the first time since the exit from the APP was announced in mid-2018. The Council will likely remain cautious and view the balance of risks as still tilted to the downside. The accommodative policy stance will remain appropriate.However, Lagarde is likely to oversee one immediate change. That is, they expect the willingness to use “all instruments” to be conditioned on an assessment of the possible side effects of policy. Christine Lagarde could use today’s press conference to push eurozone governments to boost spending, to fight a future of weak growth and ever-low interest rates.Kyle Rodda of IG says:Monetary policy is losing its efficacy, and central bankers know that’s the case. Fiscal authorities, saddled by the decades of debt governments accumulated in the late 20 the century, have laid back since the US financial crisis, handing the reins of economic policy over to central bankers. Now, just like governments before them, central bankers are realizing the limitations of their policy tools, and want sovereigns to step back in to drive western economies back to “normal” economic conditions.It’ll only be one moment in time for now, however President Lagarde’s speech could well define that will become the new normal for macroeconomic policy across the globe.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.There’s a new chief in town at the European Central Bank, and she’s about to outline her strategy to drag the eurozone out of its rut.Christine Lagarde is chairing her first monetary policy meeting in Frankfurt, where the ECB’s governing council will set interest rates and discuss its stimulus programme. President Lagarde will then face the press, taking on the baton from Mario Draghi.Will Lagarde have the same powers over the markets as the man who saved the euro? She may take a similar approach as Draghi keeping monetary policy loose while urging politicians to do more. If so, she’ll face a similar tussle with hawkish members of the Council who weren’t happy that the ECB launched a new bond-buying stimulus programme in September. We’re not expecting any changes to policy today, but Lagarde’s comments will be closely scrutinised. Her new vision for the ECB easily move the markets.Lagarde has a good understanding of the eurozone’s problems, from her time running the International Monetary Fund. Back in September, she threw her support behind the Bank’s bond-buying programme and record low interest rates, telling MEPS:The challenges that warrant the ECB’s current policy stance have not disappeared . The euro area economy faces some near-term risks, mainly related to external factors, and inflation remains persistently below the ECB’s objective.The former French finance minister also supports closer fiscal integration within the eurozone, to shore up the currency union. And it can’t simply wait until the next crisis. As she put it:In my experience as Finance Minister, I have witnessed the difficulties in coordinating fiscal policies, which are inherently focused on national issues and not the euro area perspective. That is why I am convinced that we need both effective and simplified rules and a meaningful euro area fiscal instrument as a complement.In other words, we need to further institutionalise cooperation rather than trust it will emerge in crisis times.But that accommodative stance is unpopular with some in the eurozone, such as German savers, so Lagarde may face pressure to end the days of ultra-loose policy and negative interest rates.Lagarde is planning a wide-ranging review of the ECB, that could lead to a revamp of its activities. She is also keen to put the climate emergency at the heart of the Bank’s plans, so we may learn today what that means in practice. Green MEPs have already questioned how the Bank can take environmental issues seriously while buying debt issued by oil giants and car makers.

And guess what – they were nothing like you’d expect. You know the caricature I mean: the working-class Brexiter. The exact people the two big parties are battling over in the very last hours before the polls close. The mythical group pundits say stands at the heart of what Sky News bills as “the Brexit Election”.And yet I cannot think of any other demographic treated more superficially and transactionally than the four million-odd Labour voters who voted leave in 2016. Superficial is the Attenborough-esque spot on the news in which a intrepid TV crew treks to a post-industrial town and lurks in drizzle outside a branch of Sports Direct, ready to pounce upon exotic passersby and prod them into a few barks about Europe and “getting on with it”.Transactional is the way Westminster types (both red and blue) worry about whether their party sounds sufficiently “leave-y” or how Boris Johnson will don pristine workwear and plough a JCB through a polystyrene wall. Because that’s what the proles want, isn’t it? Sod what they need.At the very root is condescension, from all sides. You know how it goes: “Oh, these idiots who don’t know what they voted for!” Which is where a conversation I had just before this election comes in.I was visiting a lunch club run by a local volunteer in one of the poorest parts of Colchester, Essex, at the start of school half-term. Inside a scout hut, about 45 kids and their parents were getting a free cooked meal to ease the cost of holiday eating. Over chips, Gary and Rebecca were telling me how they regularly live off one meal a day. More happily, they remembered a rare summer holiday, a long weekend when they took their children 30 miles down the road to the seaside. Their borrowed caravan couldn’t fit everyone, so Gary slept on the ground outside.Yeah, they voted Brexit – not out of hatred of immigrants but because, as Rebecca said: “It’s not right that we give all the money to Europe, not when we have so many people going without in this country.”Shopworker Gary pointed into the scout hut: babbling boys and girls were filling their plates to the brim, while their parents enjoyed the luxury of not having to starve today.Did they really think that Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg would send any of those EU millions to this housing estate, to them and the other families relying on holiday handouts? “ ’Course not,” said Gary, shrugging. And the same went for everyone I asked that lunchtime.In one of the country’s biggest leave-voting regions, most people in this room had voted for the promises of Brexit, and yet had zero faith in them. They would believe the lying £350m bus, but not its fibbing, blond frontman. They accepted how bad things were, but they didn’t imagine for a minute that politicians would make it better.This is part of a far more complex, contradictory picture than you are normally given of working-class leave voters, and without it you can’t understand the forces shaping this election. I have spent years talking to such voters, whether in Colchester or north-east Derbyshire or Newbiggin or Blaenau Gwent. Different places, different histories, different politics. But there are a few common themes, particularly over Brexit and the political class. You rarely hear them on the Today programme or read them in the newspapers – yet, unless they get a proper ventilation, the decade-long crisis that Britain is mired in will stretch on for many more years.Second, while the political class define ancient history as what happened last week, voters remember that they have been waterboarded by crisis after crisis. Take Gary, who knew where this Brexit idend would end up: “It’s going to go to their mates in the City of London.” His remains perhaps the only reference I’ve heard to the financial sector in this entire election, yet it is being fought in the shadow of the 2008 crash and the cuts to the public realm and to our living standards that have followed.Remember that figure of £1.2 trillion? It was splashed across obedient newspapers as the Tory calculation of the cost of Labour’s spending splurge. It was also the amount the International Monetary Fund calculated that the UK stuck behind the finance sector immediately after the crash, in bailouts and loans and guarantees on City trading. Without so much as a by your leave the bankers were thrown a lifeline now deemed unaffordable for our public services.In 2008, good-hearted progressives were full of resolutions about “don’t let a good crisis go to waste”. Well, over the past decade we’ve had our fill of good crises: banking, MPs’ expenses, phone hacking. And the main message from all this has been that Britain’s key institutions are both unreformed and essentially unreformable.How do voters respond to that, especially those who have done least well out of the past decade? They tune out. Earlier this year I went door-knocking round a Northumberland housing estate with Jamie Driscoll, Labour North of Tyne mayor, and in what is called Labour’s heartland the most common response was: “I don’t follow politics”, followed by the slamming of a door. One canvasser remarked: “Policy doesn’t matter here. They’ve forgotten what government can do.” If there’s one statement Labour should take to heart after this election, it’s that.A month before the 2016 referendum I was in Pontypool. This south Wales market town used to be lovely. You could see that. But, as one local flatly remarked: “It’s dead now because they took what they wanted. Thatcher smashed the unions. There used to be coal mines. Boosh! ‘We’re out of here.’ They’ve moved on.” When the culture of Labourism got destroyed, so did the attendant affiliation to the Labour party. The Westminster lot were all “liars” and London was a leech, always hungry for more.This is what decades of distrust produces. Not magical thinking or unstinting belief in posh-boy fairytales, but a deep and sullen resentment.

The cheapest en-suite room available costs £135 a week, which adds up to £6,885 for a 51-week tenancy.The National Union of Students said its manifesto for the general election included a demand that the next government “tackle the spiralling costs of student accommodation and ensure rooms are accessible to all students”.The survey found that accommodation was cheaper in university-owned or operated accommodation or halls of residence, although that varied by location. London universities and colleges had the biggest gap between their rents and those of private providers, but still averaged around £7,500 a year.While the average private-sector en-suite rental outside London was £6,271 a year, similar university accommodation was only £80 a year lower."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/feca15320799437784a5dca214b55b2b36058d3c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3afb493973a3b76a3566926239c3e8fb","title":"on the front line of the climate emergency in pictures","story":"As COP25 takes place in Madrid, this collection of photographs from Getty Images highlights the climate crisis around the world, from Greenland’s melting ice sheets to rising seal levels in Alaska and Louisiana, the forest fires in the Amazon and Indonesia, and the impact of forests and the Lobster fishery in Maine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ce5335926ded0d0e4f2abb0668b29002dd88f7b/0_227_5400_3240/master/5400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eadafc920f8d383a4afd8b1a184ef59","title":"harvey weinstein settlement women","story":"If approved, settlement would bring most of the civil lawsuits pending against him to an endMore than 30 women who were allegedly subjected to sexual misconduct by the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein have reportedly reached a $25m settlement which, if approved, would bring to an end most of the civil lawsuits pending against him.Harvey Weinstein himself would not have to pay a penny to his accusers or have to admit wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, the Times reports. The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited.“I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him. I don’t know what I can really do,” the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper.The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of Weinstein’s legal woes. On 6 January his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court.The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of nonconsensual sex, criminal or civil.In August Weinstein was also charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behavior on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction.Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1m to $5m after the prosecution accused him of tampering with his electronic ankle monitor.Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by “technical glitches”.The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first broke the news of Weinstein’s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the #MeToo movement. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a bestselling book on the subject, She Said.Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein’s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12m out of a total $47m package to close the Weinstein Company’s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs.According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it.In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: “We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12m of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.”He added: “We plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db3ab20a8c67ab21a0fdc0d956929553b4e327cc/0_65_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80ef03c46d3e73b0ec10ce220aecdedb","title":"roman polanski media making me a monster and its weinsteins fault","story":"Director claims rivalry over 2003 Oscars race reignited rape backlash, now further fuelled by fresh accusations and protests against new Dreyfus filmFilm director Roman Polanski has spoken out for the first time since fresh accusations of rape were made against him, declaring that the media were “trying to make me into a monster”.And in an extraordinary twist he blamed Harvey Weinstein for his woes, in an interview with Paris Match magazine published on Wednesday.He claimed that the disgraced Hollywood mogul tried to brand him a “child rapist” to stop him (unsuccessfully, it turned out) winning an Oscar in 2003 for The Pianist. Polanski – a fugitive from US justice since 1978 when he absconded after he admitting the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, Samantha Geimer – also dismissed the latest rape allegations against him as “absurd”.He said he “absolutely denied” beating and raping French photographer Valentine Monnier at his Swiss chalet in 1975.“Obviously I have no memory of it because it is false,” he told Paris Match magazine, before pouring scorn on her story. “Clearly accusing me of rape isn’t sensational enough any more, you have to add another layer.“I do not hit women,” he added.Monnier, who was an 18-year-old model and actress at the time, went public in Le Parisien as Polanski’s new film, An Officer and a Spy, was released in France last month. She alleged that Polanski also tried to give her a pill as he beat her “into submission”.But the director repeatedly ridiculed her claims as “aberrant” in the interview, before turning on Weinstein. He blamed the producer for starting a whispering campaign against him to sabotage his chances of an Oscar after The Pianist won best film and best director at the 2003 Bafta film awards.Weinstein was pushing his own film, Chicago, which won six Oscars including best picture.“It was him who dug up my case with Samantha Geimer from 26 years before which no one was interested in any more,” Polanski told Paris Match. The Pianist – which drew on some of Polanski’s own experiences as a Jewish child in Poland during the Holocaust – went on to win three Oscars, including best director.Polanski admitted the statutory rape of Geimer in a plea bargain in 1977 to avoid a trial on more serious charges. But he fled to France after serving 42 days in jail when it appeared a judge was reconsidering his release.Asked if he felt a victim of the saga, Polanski said that “for years they have been trying to make me into a monster”.The veteran film-maker caused outrage at the Venice film festival last August by comparing himself to the hero of his new film, Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish officer wrongly punished by the French army at the turn of the 20th century.Polanski insisted that he was only speaking out now for the sake of his wife, French actress Emmanuelle Seigner, and his children.“I am used to the lies, my skin has thickened. But for my children and for Emmanuelle it’s appalling. They are suffering enormously. They are insulted and threatened on social media.“Of course I am responsible,” the 86-year-old told the magazine. “In 1977 I made a mistake and it is my family who are paying the price half a century later.”Polanski accused the media of treating him with “incredible violence”.“They seize on every new false accusation, no matter how absurd, because it lets them bring up this story. It is like a curse which keeps coming back and I can do nothing about.”Polanski also claimed that Geimer, who he was accused of drugging and raping at Jack Nicholson’s Los Angeles home, had suffered more from the press than anything he had done to her. “She and her family have suffered because of what I did, and despite me it continues,” he told Paris Match.Polanski is persona non grata in Hollywood, and cannot return to the US for fear of arrest. Despite being expelled from the US Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, he has been defended by many in the French film industry.Protesters in France forced several screenings of An Officer and a Spy to be abandoned. But the movie has become one of the most successful French films of the year, with more than 1.1 million flocking to see it in its first three weeks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b25364da855d284fd4c9beae1ed4b3e68318667/0_154_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dedfdcb34e4c8bc4b899f66bc6f251ed","title":"best films 2019 uk no 7 once upon a time in hollywood","story":"Quentin Tarantino’s masterful projection of 1960s LA may rewrite history, but is saturated with his love of the eraNot much stands between us and the Netflix-inspired bonfire of the cinemagoing experience: even titans such as Martin Scorsese have succumbed, caught between the pressing needs of escalating production budgets and shrinking box-office expectations. To give him his due, Quentin Tarantino is not going down without a fight. This is a director who prizes the actual projection of celluloid on large silver screens – and, in fact, one of the most enjoyable sequences in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood follows starlet Sharon Tate into a movie-theatre showing of the spy comedy The Wrecking Crew, in which she appeared opposite Dean Martin. From the lobby cards to the upholstery to the glittering beams of light, Tarantino offers a lovingly detailed homage to the act of film-watching as it was practised in late 1960s Los Angeles.Tarantino isn’t only interested in the big screen, though much of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is just as concerned with the industrial-scale production of the kind of TV shows that fuelled the everyday entertainment habits of Americans. (Tarantino, six years old at the time the film is set, would no doubt have soaked up countless shows like Bounty Law, the fictitious western serial of which Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is the star.) Not only does Tarantino create superbly realised extended sequences of a real-life show, Lancer, in which Dalton has a guest-star bad-hat role he also films hilarious versions of TV ephemera: on-set interviews, commercial spots and the like.The symbiotic Hollywood connection between TV and film is spelled out in Dalton’s career quandary: should he stick it out in La La Land, or head over to Italy, Clint Eastwood-style, where a casting agent (Al Pacino) can get him work in spaghetti westerns. (Not Sergio Leone – Tarantino’s personal favourite, Sergio Corbucci, gets the namecheck here.) Tarantino’s connoisseurship ranges widely: we get a glimpse of the Joe Namath biker pic CC and Company, an encounter with Bruce Lee on the set of The Green Hornet (Tarantino got a lot of grief from Lee’s daughter Shannon for having his movie Lee first threaten and then get a kicking from Brad Pitt’s stuntman character), and shelves full of comics and merch of the era.Tarantino’s masterstroke, though, is to connect this Hollywood life with the Spahn ranch, the former TV set where the Manson family set up shop. It’s there where Pitt’s Cliff Booth, an acquaintance of the owner George Spahn (in real life notoriously pacified by sex with Manson’s female acolytes), confronts the family en masse, and realises their less than benevolent intent.For approximately the first two-thirds of the film, this is great stuff (the Bruce Lee scene aside, which is pretty funny even if it is a travesty). It’s that ending that in my view that lets Once Upon a Time in Hollywood down. Tarantino’s predilection for wish-fulfilment rearrangement of history has let him down before – surely I can’t be the only person who sees the ending of Inglourious Basterds, when Hitler and Goebbels are murdered in a cinema, as just as tasteless as – SPOILER ALERT – Booth and Dalton’s offing of Manson’s crew of murderous hippies, slasher-movie style. Certain critics have panned Tarantino’s view of the hippie era as regressive – that is certainly the case, but he is entitled to his point of view. It’s the boneheadedness of thinking it’s fine to replace harsh reality with glib film-nerd narratives that means this film is only good, rather than great."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ee60a90bc6aa624a3107dcc1165ef1155c6ffc5/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=961b64a604a9cecd4cd88d4703ba23c7","title":"crass and contemptible is clint eastwoods new movie built on a lie","story":"Oscar-tipped drama Richard Jewell, the story of the security guard falsely accused of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing, has come under fire for suggesting a journalist traded sex for FBI tipsClint Eastwood’s indignant, Oscar-buzzed new drama Richard Jewell tasks itself with a noble and initially justifiable aim: to tell the truth about a man whose name has been unfairly slandered. It’s written, quite literally on the poster, with the words “true” and “truth” promising, at long last, facts behind the headlines that followed the tragic bombing at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. But there’s a catch.In an attempt to clear the name of Jewell, the security guard wrongfully accused of creating and planting the pipe bomb that directly killed one person and injured 111 others, the film throws another name under the bus, that of Kathy Scruggs, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution journalist who broke the story that he was under investigation. Its recent premiere at the AFI festival was accompanied by unease over a scene where Scruggs trades sex for a tip from an FBI agent, a damaging allegation that’s yet to be supported by any tangible evidence. To complicate matters further, Scruggs isn’t able to give her side of the story. She died in 2001 from an overdose of prescription drugs at the age of 42.“I was stunned,” AJC’s current editor-in-chief, Kevin Riley, who attended last month’s premiere, said to the . “No one has ever said Kathy did anything like that.”Initial outrage over the scene recently gave way to the threat of legal action, with the AJC choosing to hire the high-powered Hollywood lawyer Marty Singer, a man the New York Times once referred to as the “guard dog of the stars”. He drafted a letter aimed at Warner Bros and screenwriter Billy Ray, calling out the film’s depiction of Scruggs and her colleagues as “extraordinarily reckless” and imploring the studio to add a disclaimer to the film along with a public statement. He warned that if they choose to disregard this, legal action will follow.The story of Jewell, played on-screen by the BlacKkKlansman and I, Tonya star Paul Walter Hauser, is one of undeniable frustration, of an innocent, if over-eager, law enforcement hopeful whose bravery was warped into something darker by the FBI who thrust him to the top of their list of suspects for a gruelling 88-day period. His public transformation from hero to villain serves as a cautionary tale for the authorities and the media, a call for caution in how cases of such gravity are handled.In the film, produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, he’s painted as a sympathetic victim, a well-intentioned, if naive, patriot while the agent on his tail, played by Jon Hamm but based on an amalgamation of real-life characters, and journalist close behind, played by Olivia Wilde, are both the clear villains. In reviews of the film, Wilde’s portrayal of Scruggs has been referred to as an “aggressive, unethical” reporter possessing a “sultry greediness” who was “ruthless, manipulative” and who “all but looks at the camera and says, ‘I am the bad guy in this movie’”. It’s a raucous, vampish, overtly sexual performance that sees Scruggs complain about covering the Olympics, calling it a “fucking nightmare” while complaining that it doesn’t get her “hard” without any crime occurring.“She was one of the better reporters I ever worked with,” her former reporting partner Ron Martz has said of Scruggs. “She was really tough and hard-nosed. When she went after a story she did what was necessary to get the story, within legal and ethical bounds.”The offending scene sees Scruggs slithering up to Hamm’s fictional FBI agent in a garishly lit bar, seeking a scoop. After being stonewalled, she claims she already knows the bureau is looking into somebody via sources. “Well Kathy, if you couldn’t fuck it out of them then what makes you think you can fuck it out of me?” he says.She scoffs, leaning in closer to him, caressing his inner thigh. He expresses concern over the case being jeopardised by leaked information but she tells him she would never go to print without a second verified source and that “would put us in a very different zone, as you know”, she purrs. “What kind of zone?” he asks. “We have to find out” she replies, leaning closer. After he reveals that the FBI is looking into Jewell, she calls him a “fat fuck who lives with his mother”.“This kind of puts a clock on things though,” she adds. “You want to get a room or just go to my car?”“This is happening?” he asks.“This is happening,” she confirms.“Well let’s get the fuck out of here then,” he says and the pair leave.The following scene, the morning after, has Scruggs sauntering into the office to her colleague Martz, asking him to do “one of those better word things” that he does, rewriting her copy as “you know I kinda write like a brick”. It’s all very dramatically juicy and firmly places Scruggs and her techniques in an easily definable amoral zone but it’s an encounter that remains entirely unverified.“If they had actually contacted me it might have ruined their idea of what they wanted the story to be,” Martz said recently to the AJC. “It’s obvious to me they did not go to any great lengths to find out what the real characters were like.”A family friend, attorney Edward Tolley, told the AJC that “if she’s being portrayed as some floozy, it’s just not true.”The film is based on both a 1997 Vanity Fair article by Marie Brenner and The Suspect, a recently released book written by Kent Alexander and Kevin Salwen. Alexander was the US attorney for Georgia at the time of the bombing while Salwen was covering the event for the Wall Street Journal and they conducted over 180 interviews for their research. The pair acted as consultants for the film, drawing on their vast knowledge of what really happened.In the book, Scruggs is described as “a delightful throwback to the 1930s newspaper wars” who could be seen as rude, bombastic and wild but also authentic and hard-working. “Kathy never quietly entered a room, she exploded into it,” said Martz in the book. Scruggs was famed for her connections within both the Atlanta police department and the FBI. One of her tactics was using her sexuality to flirt with cops at a local bar after hours but rumours that she would sleep with sources were just that. Scruggs would wear short skirts and low-cut blouses in a male-dominated office but any reputation that arose as a result was based on a regressive assumption. Her drive was relentless and her track record impressive. Before the Olympics, she was in charge of a regular column that helped the FBI and other agencies “apprehend nearly one hundred alleged criminals”.After the bombing, Scruggs worked tirelessly to secure a lead, eventually finding an APD source who revealed that Jewell had become the new focus, a shift based both on inevitability (even in the film, Hamm’s fed barks that “You always look at the guy who found the bomb just like you look at the guy who found the body”) and a mounting collection of concerning yet ultimately circumstantial evidence (Jewell had found himself in hot water for impersonating a police officer in the past and lost a security job for alleged threatening behaviour while he was reportedly a user of a site that featured the notorious bomb recipe-containing Anarchist Cookbook).For “a dedicated reporter” like Scruggs, though, one source wasn’t enough and she found another who agreed to meet her in a bar after work. While he confirmed that Jewell was a suspect, he couched it by telling her she couldn’t do anything just yet as “it might ruin the investigation”. She left after 30 minutes according to the book, returning the office frustrated, refusing to name her source and worked harder to find more confirmation. The story was then deliberated over, every word carefully picked and run past the FBI’s PR representative to ensure that printing it wouldn’t hinder the investigation.I contacted Alexander and Salwen who agreed to speak to me about the book. After praising Eastwood’s film over the phone, I asked them about its portrayal of Scruggs. They froze. They didn’t realise it would be a call about Kathy. They had a statement that would be coming out later that day and agreed to speak to me after it was released.The statement refers to Scruggs as “an outstanding police reporter” who “accurately” broke the story of Jewell becoming the primary suspect. But then it continues:“Scruggs secured her Jewell scoop from a law enforcement source. We have been asked repeatedly whether we found evidence that Scruggs traded sex for the story. We did not. Though this exchange may be depicted differently in the movie, Richard Jewell, we urge everyone to see this excellent film which conveys the story of Jewell, the unsung hero, in a compelling, dramatic and entertaining manner.”It confirmed what I already knew, that the allegation wasn’t taken from their exhaustive and unparalleled research, but also that they didn’t appear to have a problem with its inclusion or at least any wish to express it. Before my second call the day after, the publicist informed me that I wouldn’t be able to ask about this scene but could talk about Kathy in general. Their statement would be the final word on that matter.On the call, they praised her as a “terrific police reporter” whose work was “extraordinarily well-sourced” and thought Wilde’s performance was “fantastic”, having met with her themselves.“I think in general, look, the film is not a documentary,” Salwen said at one point.He also referred to the importance of “accuracy” in reporting and called the behaviour of the media outlets who followed Scruggs’s “very well-checked” story “despicable”, with the film providing a much-needed reminder of journalistic unprofessionalism. I countered that I and many others have seen the film as painting Scruggs to be the only visible, despicable face of the media, villainising her in the process, something their book is at pains not to do.“I’m not sure I agree necessarily with your assessment there, I think that the movie does feature other news outlets rushing to judgment,” Salwen said.Alexander followed: “You can quibble with a scene here or there for sure but taking in broad strokes of Kathy’s life, I think she was a larger-than-life figure and the movie got that across. I spoke with my wife who thought Kathy was just great and loved her as a character in the movie.”What the film fails to add, and what the book includes in detail, is how Scruggs’s career and health were affected in the years following. Jewell filed lawsuits against many of the publications and networks who he claimed had libelled him. Even though NBC and CNN stood by their reporting, they both settled with him out of court and the New York Post followed suit.But the AJC refused to do the same, holding its ground and defending its reporting. Ultimately, in 2011, the Georgia court of appeals ruled for the paper “because the articles in their entirety were substantially true at the time they were published”. It was a long-fought victory but one that sadly, Scruggs wasn’t alive to see.Throughout the legal battle that followed her story she refused to name her source and the drawn-out proceedings took their toll on her mental and physical health. “The pressure of the lawsuit never strayed far from her psyche,” Salwen and Alexander write in their book. An injury earlier in her career had led to chronic back pain and in September 2001, after a summer of isolating herself at home, she was found unconscious. The cause of death was ruled as “acute morphine toxicity” resulting from her prescription medication.The fallout from the film, which Warners is pushing for Oscars, having secured a Golden Globe nomination for Kathy Bates as Jewell’s mother, continued just days before its 13 December release.Warners has responded to allegations of defamation by calling any lawsuit “baseless” and defending its right not to add any statement addressing the scene to the film.“It is unfortunate and the ultimate irony that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, having been a part of the rush to judgment of Richard Jewell, is now trying to malign our film-makers and cast,” the statement read. “Richard Jewell focuses on the real victim, seeks to tell his story, confirm his innocence and restore his name.”Eastwood’s response was similar. When asked this week to discuss the controversy he claimed that the AJC was “probably looking for ways to rationalise their activity” but added that he’d never discussed it with anyone from the paper.But what Warners or Eastwood or screenwriter Ray (who “reserved comment” when I asked him to talk via email and whose next project is the small-screen adaptation of James Comey’s book A Higher Loyalty) have yet to reveal is where this allegation of sexual bartering came from and why the film decides to deviate from other accounts. Warners has said that the standard disclaimer during the film’s end credits – “Dialogue and certain events and characters contained in the film were created for the purposes of dramatisation” – covers any embellishment.Wilde, whose father is a respected journalist and the current DC editor of Harper’s Magazine and whose mother is an award-winning journalist turned Democratic congresswoman, didn’t attend the AFI festival premiere for Richard Jewell and has avoided any press for the film.Earlier this month, though, she offered up a defence of her portrayal on the red carpet for the Gotham Awards. The actor, who made her directorial debut this year with the female-fronted teen comedy Booksmart, has claimed critiquing the scene in question is actually sexist in itself.“I think it’s a shame that she has been reduced to one inferred moment in the film,” Wilde said. “It’s a basic misunderstanding of feminism as pious sexlessness. It happens a lot to women we’re expected to be one-dimensional if we are to be considered feminists. There’s a complexity to Kathy, as there is to all of us, and I really admired her.”She also criticised people for condemning a project that allows “for a woman to be impure” without addressing the factual issues at hand. While Wilde hasn’t made mention of the film or controversy on Twitter, she liked a tweet that urged people to “get their priorities in line” and take Eastwood and Ray to task rather than her.At the paper, emotions are understandably still running high. Editor-in-chief Riley told me he remained concerned over the film perpetuating “a false and troubling Hollywood trope” attached to female journalists.A current reporter at the paper also shared her thoughts. “The movie version of Scruggs is crass and contemptible,” Jennifer Brett told the . “She relies on trysts with her sources for information, curses at her colleagues, breaks into someone’s car hoping for an interview and shows no empathy after the deadly bombing, praying only that the suspect will turn out to be interesting. Those who knew and worked with Scruggs bristle at that depiction, and of course she’s not here to speak for herself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce5f187a24a2e509f00d27b9742da53edf720107/401_84_5355_3213/master/5355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1c7cd90c449b110b44af0f7d89b0777","title":"the kingmaker imelda marcos philippines documentary lauren greenfield","story":"The former first lady of the Philippines is revealed as a monstrous, loathsome, absurdly queenly figure in Lauren Greenfield’s superb documentaryLauren Greenfield’s film about the Philippines’ former first lady Imelda Marcos reveals a grotesquely self-pitying, wholly unrepentant and very rich woman, who has clearly still kept her hands on a great deal of the American aid money that successive US presidents once gave the Philippines in return for suppressing communism and civil rights and showing hospitality to US naval power – cash that she and her husband, Ferdinand, looted from the public purse and salted away abroad.This was the larceny that finally got them booted out of office and briefly exiled in the 80s, but Imelda returned to her homeland as a widow, and is now trying to create a gruesome Marcos dynasty, led by her idiot son, Ferdinand Jr (nicknamed “Bongbong”), and another daughter, Shee. They are minor politicians who are, to cite the TV show Succession, the Kendall and Shiv of this story, with waxy hatchet-faced Imelda very much the Logan Roy figure.The Marcoses’ patent mediocrity and corrupted brand identity appear to have put serious political power out of reach for them, for now. But their resurgent cynicism and corruption created the conditions for Rodrigo Duterte, the quasi-fascist new strongman president who is shown contemptuously tolerating the Marcoses for what they could yet do for him.It seems at first as if this is going to be simply a black-comic portrait of entitlement, comparable to Greenfield’s 2012 film The Queen of Versailles. Actually, it is more than that: a larger, tragic picture of tyranny and corruption in the Philippines that might stand alongside Josh Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing (2012) and The Look of Silence (2014) about the repression and slaughter in Indonesia.There are exquisitely horrible moments in this portrait when Marcos, taking us around her fabulous Manila home, and speaking in an absurdly queenly and soft-voiced way about her lifestyle and her plans for the future, unknowingly reveals how loathsome she is. Or perhaps she does know and doesn’t care, and has a shrewd sense of how her outrageousness plays well with a certain part of her (sizeable) fanbase. But it is truly stomach-turning as she gives banknotes to poor little children in the street and, on being taken to a children’s cancer hospital, Madame Marcos winces with disgust at their poverty and suffering and says to an aide: “Give me some money to give away.”Briefly, we are taken through her history: she was the former beauty queen who enjoyed a whirlwind romance with Ferdinand, the ambitious young politician. Once in power, Ferdinand was content to let Imelda go abroad to meet foreign leaders – there is an emetic shot of Mao kissing her hand. This was because he feared leaving the country in case he was toppled in a coup, and also wanted to pursue extramarital affairs. When Imelda discovered these, a certain hardness entered in her soul, making it even harder than it already was. The Marcoses took the cash intended for roads, schools etc and converted it into jewels, paintings and prime Manhattan real estate, while striking brutally at civil rights, using detention and torture. Their rival, Benigno Aquino, was imprisoned, exiled and finally murdered, and his widow, Cory, was later to take over as president herself. There are wrenchingly emotional interviews with those who were detained and tortured under the Marcos regime. A grisly symbol of the corruption is the bizarre wild animal reserve that Imelda created on Calauit Island, a vanity project that involved moving hundreds of families off the land, and whose giraffes are now not properly cared for – like everyone and everything else.For all that Marcos has to be one of the most purely objectionable figures in public life anywhere in the world, she is not a fool and occasionally reveals shrewd insights about herself. She notes how cordially she was received internationally and smirks: “Sometimes it helps that you are not taken too seriously.” Later, with regard to her blandly conceited image management, she remarks: “Perception is real, but the truth is not.”• The Kingmaker is released in the UK on 13 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a3334e217935c355b9ad83e9e19fb9d4339bc08/0_176_3977_2387/master/3977.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12a2a588b73db258349034cee1c7cbd6","title":"bayern munich tottenham hotspur champions league match report","story":"José Mourinho rested key players with Tottenham already certain to finish this Champions League group in second place and the manager had wanted the club’s fringe players to show their ability to give him one or two selection headaches for the Premier League challenges ahead.First the good news. Ryan Sessegnon, on his first Spurs start, showed flickers of his pace on the left wing, worked diligently in defensive terms, made good decisions and enjoyed a moment he will never forget when he lashed home the equaliser for 1-1. Sessegnon had plenty of time to feel the hammer of his heart but he concentrated purely on the cleanness of the finish. It flew past Manuel Neuer from 12 yards, beating the Germany World Cup-winner at his near post.Yet the positives for Mourinho were hardly abundant in supply and he could feel a small dent to the feelgood factor that had built up over the first five games of his tenure.Bayern Munich were too good, even without Robert Lewandowski, who was rested. Happily for Spurs, this was not another shellacking to follow the 7-2 in October. But there was the impression that the home team had played within themselves and still managed to highlight weaknesses in the Spurs rearguard, particularly on the flanks, where Kyle Walker-Peters and Danny Rose endured difficult evenings.Kingsley Coman, Thomas Müller, who came on as a substitute, and the excellent Philippe Coutinho scored the goals and Bayern will be intimidating opponents in the knockout rounds, despite their domestic struggles. For Spurs, the attention turns to Sunday’s visit to Wolves, which will be followed by the home game against Chelsea a week later. Mourinho made the point this was more akin to an information-gathering exercise.“Today was play and prepare a game when you put more emphasis on the players who rest than the players who play,” he said. “I try to hide that feeling but the players are intelligent guys and they understand my focus was not on today. My focus was on what next.Everything was fixed beforehand in terms of the group permutations, with Spurs knowing that they will be paired with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus, Barcelona, RB Leipzig or Valencia in the last 16. Playing the second leg away from home represents a big disadvantage in Mourinho’s eyes but if Spurs could get through to the open draw for the quarter-finals he feels anything could happen.Atalanta won 3-0 away to Shakhtar Donetsk to take second place in Group C – despite losing their first three group games by an aggregate score of 11-2.Needing a win to progress with Dinamo Zagreb losing to Manchester City, the Italian side went ahead in the 69th minute when Timothy Castagne poked the ball home at the second attempt.\u0026nbspShakhtar\u0027s chances of an equaliser were hit by a red card for Dodo, before late goals from Mario Pasalic and Robin Gosens sealed an unexpected last-16 place in their debut Champions League campaign.PSG completed a dominant group stage with a 5-0 win over Galatasaray, with five different players finding the net. Mauro Icardi, Pablo Sarabia, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé all struck before Edinson Cavani\u0027s late penalty.Elsewhere in Group A, Real Madrid were pegged back by Club Brugge before goals from Vinícius Júnior and Luka Modric sealed an away win. Rodrygo\u0027s half-volley put the visitors ahead early in the second half, before Hans Vanaken equalised two minutes later.Juventus completed an unbeaten Group D campaign with a 2-0 win at Bayer Leverkusen. Late goals from Cristiano Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín – both set up by Paulo Dybala – and Atlético Madrid\u0027s win over Lokomotiv Moscow ended Leverkusen\u0027s faint hopes of qualifying.In Group B, Olympiakos defeated Red Star Belgrade 1-0 to snatch a Europa League place in a game of two penalties. Tomané missed his spot-kick for Red Star, before Youssef El Arabi converted late on for the hosts.It was disappointing to see how flat Spurs were at the outset, how lacking in intensity they were and Bayern took a grip. They went close when Benjamin Pavard drew a sharp save out of Paulo Gazzaniga and Thiago Alcântara could not smuggle home the rebound, and the breakthrough followed shortly afterwards. Serge Gnabry’s low cross deflected off Moussa Sissoko to fall kindly for Kingsley Coman, who beat Gazzaniga with a composed finish. Coman would be forced off with an injury.At 1-0, it was possible to fear for Spurs. Apart from one Sessegnon burst and shot, they had offered nothing. But they were settled by his goal, which followed a ball from Giovani Lo Celso that was deflected on its way through. The 19-year-old, whose integration after his £25m summer move from Fulham has been delayed because of injury, felt a rush of emotion when his shot ripped past Neuer, although Mourinho would take a tough-love line with him.“He always arrives in dangerous positions and he is a good finisher,” he said. “He can improve. He lost too many inidual duels. He has a lot to develop but the potential is there.”Spurs may have led on 33 minutes had Sissoko not fluffed the final ball when well placed but they always looked vulnerable at the back. They rode their luck when Alcântara missed an open goal after Gnabry’s shot had come back off the post but they were soon behind again. Gnabry’s cross deflected off Toby Alderweireld the impressive Alphonso Davies’s shot hit the post and Müller stabbed home. The half-time damage might have been worse, with Coutinho denied by the crossbar from 25 yards.One of Mourinho’s laments has been the lack of time he has had with his players, how he must develop his style “while we are running”. It felt like that here, with Spurs lacking cohesion. Eric Dier and Sissoko struggled to set any kind of tone in possession from central midfield while Christian Eriksen only came into the game in the closing stages.Coutinho’s goal for 3-1 was a lovely curler from the edge of the box and although the Spurs substitute, Son Heung-min, twice went close following Eriksen passes, the die had been cast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11ce9c2677753b2ad86740161c49fcc058d9bf14/0_209_3967_2380/master/3967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ed2b43862ebec2b7e7ff026772ac4bd","title":"dinamo zagreb manchester city champions league match report","story":"Jesus said: “When I was young, I’d think about the Champions League. It’s a very special moment when I score and a hat-trick as well.”With Phil Foden pulling the strings – and Dinamo Zagreb around – from midfield Jesus had admirable support on a night when Benjamin Mendy also gave a reminder of why he was signed.City were already in the last 16 as Group C winners but required a morale-boosting victory after a dire run of form. For this challenge Guardiola retained Rodri, Jesus and Ilkay Gündogan from Saturday’s loss to Manchester United, made Foden’s 50th City appearance a fourth start this term and handed Eric García a full debut in the competition.All that meant this outing might not be the best barometer of form and mood. Yet the way Nicolás Otamendi lost Dani Olmo before he volleyed Damian Kadzior’s ball past Claudio Bravo was the latest addition to a catalogue of defensive calamities. The finish was supreme but caused more questions regarding a rearguard who have now kept one clean sheet in their past 12 matches.For a packed Stadion Maksimir this was the dream beginning – City fans apart – as Zagreb required victory to retain any chance of qualification. For the visitors it was poor, but Foden zipped the ball through midfield allowing City to launch the quick attacks Guardiola desires.Atalanta won 3-0 away to Shakhtar Donetsk to take second place in Group C – despite losing their first three group games by an aggregate score of 11-2.Needing a win to progress with Dinamo Zagreb losing to Manchester City, the Italian side went ahead in the 69th minute when Timothy Castagne poked the ball home at the second attempt.\u0026nbspShakhtar\u0027s chances of an equaliser were hit by a red card for Dodo, before late goals from Mario Pasalic and Robin Gosens sealed an unexpected last-16 place in their debut Champions League campaign.PSG completed a dominant group stage with a 5-0 win over Galatasaray, with five different players finding the net.

Tomané missed his spot-kick for Red Star, before Youssef El Arabi converted late on for the hosts.An angled pass to Mendy allowed the left-back to whip in a cross that had Jesus leaping and Dominik Livakovic punching away just in time.Olmo may have scored once more when running through – Otamendi again could not get near him – but he blasted his shot over. Next Olmo’s flick found Mislav Orsic and this time Bravo saved the header.What City had lacked in the run of two wins in seven matches was quality in the boxes, as Guardiola says. An illustration of what was required came via the equaliser. Riyad Mahrez swept the ball into the back post from the right and Jesus was lethal with his head: simple and effective. That made him the youngest Brazilian, at 22 years and 252 days, to hit 10 Champions League goals, beating Neymar’s previous mark.The goal angered Zagreb, though, as Emir Dilaver had gone down during the build-up but while players surrounded Carlos del Cerro Grande, the referee ruled it legitimate and booked Arijan Ademi for his part in the protest.This was an admirable riposte from City in a hostile venue and ensured the score was level at half-time: the break came at an apt time as the ill-feeling continued when Amer Gojak may have been sent off, but was not even booked, for an elbow on Rodri near the touchline. At this juncture City were ensuring unbeaten progress to the next round and Zagreb were going out. Yet City pride themselves on winning intent and this was signalled by a Foden shot that, although high, warned their hosts.Next they carried the threat through via some delightful footwork from Jesus. Foden’s slick ball-play put the striker in near goal and after some Fred Astaire-like feet he allowed Livakovic no chance with his finish.This had Guardiola double-fist pumping and posed a question of Zagreb they would surely find difficult to answer. So it proved as the excellent Foden fed Mendy and his equally impressive cross was stabbed in by Jesus for his third. From here it was a keep-ball exercise for City before Foden scored a deserved late fourth for a team who could be proud of the character shown.On Monday, City will find out who they face. “We will all watch the draw together,” said Guardiola. “This competition is weird but hopefully we arrive in good spirits in February.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623b7fe5eed0f368dba8a0921b0f1013ff5d0ed0/409_356_4506_2703/master/4506.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da4df41b3195da6b1e076dc4f34c1c1c","title":"football transfer rumours zlatan ibrahimovic everton milan","story":"Today’s fluff got its vote in early doorsEverton fans face the prospect of a Duncan Ferguson-Zlatan Ibrahimovic buddy movie if word reaching the Rumour Mill from Italy is proved correct. Big Zlat is back in Europe having come, seen and conquered MLS by getting knocked out in the play-offs each season and is still desperate for on-field action. Milan, one of his myriad former clubs and another institution seeking a redemptive hero, may though end up being his eventual short-term destination. At 38, daring to Zlatan is only likely to be a quick fix.Even if Zlat does arrive on Merseyside, it won’t be Big Dunc calling the shots as the former “Birdman of Barlinnie” does not want the Everton job full-time. That opens the door for Carlo Ancelotti, whose main memory of Goodison Park until recently was probably being given his cards by Chelsea in the tunnel on the final day of the 2010-11 season. Mikel Arteta remains in the mix but Arsenal is the most likely destination for he of the immovable hair, a position Don Carlo is also interested in. West Ham may be a possible destination for either of them should Manuel Pellegrini get the push this weekend in the event of defeat by Southampton on Saturday. Another boss in demand is Mauricio Pochettino, who is a stalking horse for Lucien Favre at Borussia Dortmund, who is on a knife-edge despite his team reaching the Champions League knockout stage this week. As for actual transfers, it seems Leicester want to put golden handcuffs on James Maddison to make sure Manchester United have to pay a fee north of the £80m it cost to buy Harry Maguire. Should United think the playmaker is too expensive, then they may enter the race for Kai Havertz of Bayer Leverkusen, who is wanted by just about every major club in Europe. Also on the United wishlist are Atlético Madrid midfielder Saúl Ñíguez, Red Bull Salzburg’s Rumour Mill staple Erling Braut Haaland and Ajax star Donny van de Beek, none of whom will come anything like cheap. Another midfielder in demand is Genk’s Sander Berge, who Liverpool have had their eye on for a while, only for Napoli to step into the picture. “They expressed an appreciation for Berge, but we didn’t go beyond that,” said Genk suit Peter Croonen after the two teams met in the Champions League this week.With Tammy Abraham now Chelsea’s leading man, the time for Olivier Giroud to bid au revoir may be coming in January. Internazionale and Atlético Madrid may fancy his flick-ons and less-than-prolific scoring rate. With Chelsea able to sign players in January, Giroud may be clearing some space on the wage bill for an emotional return for Nathan Aké from Bournemouth, should a £40m buy-back clause be triggered. Chelsea also have their eyes on the Lyon striker Moussa Dembélé, 23, and RB Leipzig’s Germany forward Timo Werner to bolster their forward line. And to round things off, another legend of MLS, Carlos Vela, last season’s MVP for his performances for Los Angeles FC, is a target for Barcelona on a four-month loan deal that would ease the burden on Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, Antoine Griezmann, Ousmane Dembélé and Ansu Fati before heading back across the Atlantic.

For all the pep and vim, the high-energy caffeine-football combinations of Red Bull Salzburg, there was a feeling of certainty about Liverpool’s progress to the last 16 of the Champions League.The ability of Jürgen Klopp’s team to win even when the opposition bring their A-game has been a feature of the season. A simple explanation, beyond luck and “LiVARpool” conspiracy theory, is that their base levels are just so high. This is a team of extreme qualities: physical strength, speed, attacking skills. They have more ways to win, more ways to wear you down, like a heavyweight champ who can dawdle through five rounds and still produce at any stage that lights-out right-hander.At the end of which victory for Liverpool on Tuesday, combined with Chelsea’s defeat of Lille at Stamford Bridge, was significant in other ways. Four English teams out of four will enter the draw for the last 16 of the Champions League. It is a full house completed with a match-day to spare, making it three years in a row that no English team has failed to reach the knockout stages.Even here there is a degree of uniformity. The same four teams, with the addition of Manchester United, have occupied the Premier League spots across that three-year period.For the first time, teams from Europe\u0027s \u0027big five\u0027 leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1) have claimed every available place in the Champions League knockout rounds.\u0026nbspFour English sides (Chelsea, Spurs, Man City and Liverpool) will join four Spanish teams, three from Germany, three from Italy and two from France in the draw at 11am GMT on Monday 16 December.The eight teams who finished third in their groups: Club Brugge, Olympiakos, Shakhtar Donetsk, Leverkusen, Red Bull Salzburg, Internazionale, Benfica, Ajax.It is all part of a wider trend. Worried about the anticompetitive effects of a conference-style European super league, about the oligarchical giants seizing the means of production (sorry, Gazprom!), about the grabbing hands grabbing all they can? Don’t fret. We’re already there anyway. Well, almost. Eleven of the top 16 richest clubs in Europe are in that Champions League last 16.Look down the Uefa rankings and the only missing faces are Arsenal, Sevilla, Manchester United, Roma and Porto, none of whom made it to the group stages, excluded from the top table by the pesky uncertainties of sporting competition.The only real surprises in the post-Christmas lineup are the elimination of Ajax, ranked 21 in Europe, at the hands of Valencia, ranked 28 and the ousting of Benfica, ranked 20, by Zenit St Petersburg, ranked 22. RB Leipzig are the only real outsiders, ranked 43 by Uefa and a fine example of corporate “disruption”, a startup team, brilliantly run and managed, but a piece of ambush marketing as much as a long-treasured sporting dream.Does any of this matter? It is 28 seasons since European football set itself on this path with the abandonment of the old format. The chief effect has been the kind of economic common market Tony Benn and Jeremy Corbyn preached against, a feat of uber-capitalism whereby superclub corporations are born and stronger markets allowed to dominate the small and the weak.There were 16 different flags in the last 16 of the final European Cup. That had fallen to 10 by 2015-16, to seven last season and even fewer this time. Ajax provided the perfect case study this season. Semi-finalists last year, a team built on good husbandry and good practice, but deprived instantly of their two best players by the Euro giants and demoted at a stroke to also-rans.Again, does any of this matter? Perhaps not as much as it might at first glance. For one thing the Premier League has only really found its stride in the last two seasons. These cycles come and go, based more often in details and good management. The more remarkable part of the last quarter century is how competitive European football still is at that top end, how resilient it remains.Plus of course a high-class football team is a thing of beauty however it comes into being. The transformation of Chelsea from dour oligarch’s trinket to exemplar of youth, parsimony and exuberant football has been an enforced act of alchemy. But the team who beat Lille featured eight different nationalities, three academy products and have been a joy to watch this season.Similarly Tottenham have spent £120m, net, in the last four years, have been brilliantly well-managed and are shot through with homegrown players. Liverpool’s ascent provides a more salutary kind of model: enlightened management crossed with unanswerable finances and a powerful, geographically rooted sense of identity. You don’t have to be a financial juggernaut to dominate European club football but it helps if you’re also an exceptionally well-run football machine.Of these three clubs Chelsea look the most vulnerable over two legs at this level, a team who attack with abandon and often defend the same way. The presence of José Mourinho at Spurs has been hailed as an elevation to instant European dark horse status, which tends to overlook the fact Mourinho has mustered one losing semi-final in the last six years.Liverpool clearly have it in them to win this competition again, although it would involve pushing the boundaries: no English club has retained the European Cup since Nottingham Forest 39 years ago. No English club has ever done so while winning the league the same year.Manchester City have perhaps the most intriguing route from here. City’s support may not be sold on the Uefa dream but their manager retains an obsession with this competition. The team will get stronger as Aymeric Laporte and Leroy Sané return, as Fernandinho slips back into midfield, and as the focus narrows in spring. The poverty of their recent defending may suggest otherwise. But for various reasons City are perhaps the most likely English winners.Getting there will be tough but not as tough as it has been. Many of the traditional heavyweights look a little haggard. Barcelona still have the greatest club footballer of all time on their books. Juventus have the tools to beat anyone. Real Madrid are, as ever, Real Madrid. But right now Paris Saint-Germain are perhaps the team to beat, provided Neymar and Kylian Mbappé stay fit and functional and provided they can find the right blend in front of a thrillingly powerful midfield.Much can change before February. For now the Premier League can bask once again in its own good health not to mention another full hand of four from four, achieved this time with a lack of jeopardy that speaks to the strength and depth, the high-functioning quality of the product."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d7603791ed5330f3cfae63260519a595d65fb58/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2551adf99ca2fdbf0ff49ed374cc16d","title":"microfinance lenders in sierra leone accused of payday loan interest rates","story":"Borrowers have accused NGOs of charging unfairly high interest, demanding rapid payback, and reporting debts to the policeThe world’s largest NGO has been forced to conduct an internal review of a money-lending scheme it runs for the poor in Sierra Leone after some borrowers amassed significant debts and were reported to police when they couldn’t repay loans.A  investigation into a microfinance programme run by Brac found that the NGO’s staff were failing to fully explain the conditions of the loan to borrowers, or ensure they could afford the high interest rates associated with such loans.As of May 2019, Brac Sierra Leone had a $5m (£3.9m) portfolio and 46,500 borrowers. spoke to 30 women who had taken out microfinance loans, nearly a dozen borrowed from Brac Sierra Leone. The women borrowing from Brac said they did not fully understand the repayment schedule and quickly began missing payments, meaning their debts spiralled. Some claim they were either visited by police, or held at a police station, after missing payments.Several said they had had to pay a bribe of about $5 to the police to stop the harassment.Bridget Dougherty, the microfinance programme head for Brac International, said the organisation had completed an internal investigation into these claims, and had “addressed this issue adequately with the staff in Sierra Leone”.Dougherty said: “We do not disclose internal investigation reports for external research purposes. We have staff training, audit and monitoring mechanisms in place throughout our operations to minimise the risk of such incidents. We have no further comment to add on this matter.”Sia Mansaray* borrowed about $75 from Brac. For years she had struggled to feed her five children on the $2 a day she makes breaking rocks at the quarry on the edge of Koidu, a city in eastern Sierra Leone. Her husband went to find work in the capital, Freetown, and never came back.With a weekly income of just $14 and school fees, food and rent to pay, Mansaray soon began missing payments.She took out another loan from Lapo, a Nigeria-based microfinance organisation that receives money from the African Development Bank, in an unsuccessful attempt to pay off her Brac debts, and then another loan from a local organisation to try to consolidate the first two. She ended up defaulting on all three loans and wound up with debts totalling $273.When she couldn’t pay back her loans, both Brac and Lapo reported her to the police, she said.“These organisations know we’re poor,” said Mansaray. “So how are we supposed to pay it back so quickly? The loan is too small, the interest is too high.”Her children now miss classes when she can’t afford the cost of transport or lunch. When they’re not in school, they help their mother break rocks at the quarry.Microfinance, regarded by some as a silver bullet for ending poverty, has come under increased scrutiny. No longer the panacea it promised to be, it has left behind a trail of debt among the world’s poorest people, while creating huge profits for organisations.“The product they’re offered is not substantially helping their lives,” said Bruce Martinez, who works with Kiva, a microfinance funder that has partnered with Brac in Sierra Leone. “It does feel like a payday loan, it doesn’t feel like it’s working.”Brac Sierra Leone defended the high interest rates and short repayment windows. Saidul Haque, a microfinance programme manager, said these conditions were needed because of the “risky” nature of lending to poor women.Archibald Shodeke, the head of the Sierra Leone Association of Microfinance Institutions, said interest rates across Sierra Leone are high because of the country’s rocky financial situation and and rising annual inflation rate. He said that without a robust credit reference system in Sierra Leone, it is difficult to assess borrowers’ risk, or their ability to repay on time.Haque denied that the organisation contacts the police. “Our focus is on creating a platform of financial inclusion,” he said.But several Brac credit officers, who asked to remain anonymous, said it was common for them to go to the police after one month of non-repayment. “The police step in to realise the loan,” said one. “They will arrest the inidual for the moment, take her to the police station, and one of her relatives will come and sign saying that they’ll pay back.”A spokesman for Lapo said its loans were predicated upon the market situation, type of loan and exchange rates, as well other business considerations. It added: “Our interest rates are pro-poor and one of the most competitive in the market, amongst other players.The spokesman said the organisation makes “a concerted effort” to profile the women before these loans are given.Sorie Bangura, a Lapo manager in Makeni, a town in northern Sierra Leone, confirmed that the organisation was “working with the police”. Bangura added that police can only “harass” the women, not lock them up.Brima Kamara, a police spokesperson, said police will only intervene in microfinance disputes to “help people mediate”.Kiva has suspended its relationship with Brac Sierra Leone due to concerns raised during a separate internal audit process. “We will not be re-activating financing until all of the concerns that have been raised are investigated and addressed,” said Kathy Guis, senior director of partner investments at Kiva.In response to allegations raised by the , Kiva sent a member of staff to investigate. Guis said Brac had conducted training around collection practices, which she thinks “will help them ensure that their policies are implemented uniformly throughout their branch network”.None of the women interviewed for this article had taken Kiva-supported Brac loans.Kiva also ended its relationship with Lapo in 2012, after a New York Times exposé about the large profits it was making.Abibatu Kamara*, one of Mansaray’s closest friends, with whom she took out a group loan, said the police showed up at her house six months after she had defaulted on a loan. She said Brac treated her aggressively. “Brac is the worst. They won’t compromise. They’ll put you in a cell,” she said.“There are no benefits with microcredit. But I need to eat. My children need to eat. So, what am I supposed to do? I have to take it.”*Names have been changed to protect identitiesReporting for this piece was supported by UC Berkeley’s Human Rights Center Fellowship"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4944dd56dd6e428a9155b7aafa333aa0d619128/0_103_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5acd790173907d91a38606275789c79","title":"ignore trends and make real life connections eight rules to happiness","story":"Journalist and broadcaster Caryn Franklin talks success, body image and the power of a good outfit …Former fashion editor and TV presenter Caryn Franklin has found herself in some unusual situations over the years – from reporting in battle zones to interviewing fashion heavyweights Yves Saint Laurent and Giorgio Armani.

Most days, I can do two out of those three things, so as far as I’m concerned I’m extremely successful! I think that’s realistic and allows me to be the person I need to be.Connections are better in personWorking as a fashion editor in the 1980s meant I became very good at networking. We didn’t have social media, so we had to network in real life. I’m big on real-life meetings instead of phone calls or emails, whether it’s work or socialising – you get so much more than you bargained for. Nowadays, I like socialising in small groups over a drink rather than big, noisy rooms, so I can make a connection. The older I get, the more I value making connections, no matter how simple.Ageing is the best thing that will happen to youGetting older is brilliant. I’ve been thrilled with the intellectual growth I’ve experienced, the way my perceptions and motivations have changed and the knowledge I’ve gained about myself and what it is to be human. I’ve really learned to enjoy life and prioritise the things that matter. I had a seminal experience in my 20s – my boyfriend (who became the father of my eldest daughter) was diagnosed with a very serious illness and became very ill. It was a valuable lesson and I felt lucky my body was functional. Maybe that’s why I’ve never given myself a hard time about my appearance.Ignore trends and avoid fast fashionAs the oldest of five children, my mother made my clothes as a child because it was cheaper than buying them. I was into customising early and would change the clothes she made me to suit my style, and help me express myself. My advice to anyone reading this now is the same: buy less and really look after it. Swap clothes, avoid fast fashion and learn to make or customise your own looks. Ignore trends. Wear what makes you happy and feel like you.Make social media work for youSocial media can be useful – I often use it for research and contacting people. I tell students I lecture that it’s like a car: if it’s being driven by someone carefully then it can be a great tool, but if it’s driven by someone who is irresponsible who then creates an accident, it can be very bad. It really depends on the driver, so always consider how you’re using it.Confidence and authenticity come with ageTo me, being authentic means being honest – accepting who I am and not pretending to be someone else, and that really does get easier with age. I was always authentic when I was younger, but I thought I wasn’t good enough and would constantly compare myself with others. But every one of us is authentic. Having the confidence to display your unique voice instead of hiding it or trying to suppress it, that comes with age. When you grow into yourself, you stop seeking other people’s opinions and trust your own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f76ae8407481aa68670ede95f1393561d1656535/1382_982_2655_1593/master/2655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d3facf5c4c69f5a21e4406456f5be18","title":"bbc denies political editors postal vote comments broke law","story":"Broadcaster’s political editor said on air that ballots in so far were looking ‘grim’ for LabourThe BBC has said its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, did not break electoral law when she reported claims that postal ballots painted a “grim” picture for Labour.Kuenssberg told viewers on Wednesday that while parties were not supposed to look at voting papers when they were verified – but not counted – at opening sessions, they did “get a hint” of how they were doing and it was not looking good for Labour.She said: “The forecast is that it’s going to be wet and cold tomorrow. The postal votes, of course, have already arrived. The parties – they’re not meant to look at it, but they do kind of get a hint – and on both sides people are telling me that the postal votes that are in are looking pretty grim for Labour in a lot of parts of the country.“Of course, postal voters tend to skew to elderly voters and people who vote early … but the kind of younger generation who we know skew much more to the Labour party, you might expect to turn out to the polls tomorrow. But in this winter election, turnout is just another one of these factors that we just can’t predict.”Video of her remarks, made during an interview on the BBC’s Politics Live programme, was widely shared on social media on the final day of an election campaign that has seen unprecedented criticism of the media. It led to suggestions that she could potentially have breached the Representation of the People Act, which prevents the reporting of how people voted until after polls close.A spokesperson for the broadcaster made clear they did not believe there were any issues with the on-air comments. “The BBC does not believe it, or its political editor, has breached electoral law,” they said.Party candidates and agents can observe postal votes being verified before polling day but the ballot papers are placed face down and are not counted until polls close on election day.In reality, political parties regularly use the verification process as an opportunity to try to ine information on how they are performing in constituencies and adjust tactics in the final days of the campaign. This week BuzzFeed News reported claims that a northern Labour official had told colleagues that “postal votes in all Labour seats are bad” and ordered activists to stay in so-called defensive seats already held by the party. In 2010 the Labour MP Kerry McCarthy infamously tweeted the result of the postal votes in her Bristol East constituency, for which she received a caution from the police.The Electoral Commission issued a statement on Wednesday warning against revealing results. “It may be an offence to communicate any information obtained at postal vote opening sessions, including about votes cast, before a poll has closed. Anyone with information to suggest this has happened should report it immediately to the police,” it said. has learned that Waltham Forest council in east London has been scrambling to deliver postal votes that should have been out by last Friday, after an administrative error delayed the process.The problem affected 1,470 voters in three constituencies, including Chingford and Woodford Green, which Iain Duncan Smith won for the Conservatives with a majority of 2,438 at the last election and which is a key target for Labour.The council could not say how many voters were affected in each constituency but said all but one form had now been delivered.It said 1,364 forms had been hand-delivered by the end of Monday and 105 more had been couriered to voters outside London on Tuesday and Wednesday.A council spokesman said the borough had dealt with 27,993 postal votes for this election. He apologised for the error and said the Electoral Commission had been notified.He added: “Completed postal votes will get to us if they are posted by last post on Wednesday 11 December. They can also be handed to staff at any polling station in the constituency on the day of the general election.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

This general election campaign has officially been going on since around the mid-cretaceous period. Its final day saw an update to the list of things you shouldn’t keep in the fridge, with the likes of honey, potatoes and avocados now joined by “the UK prime minister”. All the party leaders embarked on a frantic cross-country campaigning dash on Wednesday, but only one of them … no, I’m sorry. I can’t face it yet. Give it a minute.At dawn, Boris Johnson embarked on a sort of softcore Confessions of a Prime Minister tour, which by 10am had already seen him dress up as a milkman, then pop something in someone’s oven. What next? Pool boy? Cable guy? At this rate of innuendo it seemed reasonable to assume Johnson would simply be barebacking grateful activists live on the lunchtime news. Of course, his version of all this does subvert the classic porn trope. Traditionally, it’s a blue-collar guy coming to the suburban professional’s house while he’s out at work. In this case, it’s an old Etonian milkman knocking on the door of working-class homes. Someone’s certainly going to get screwed, but not in a sexual way.Unfortunately, things would take a wrong turn for Johnson back at the dairy – a sentence I might once have found mildly unusual, before I realised that Johnson’s workwear adviser for this election was probably going to get a CBE in the new year honours. This week alone, Johnson has dressed up as a fisherman, a digger driver, a milkman, a builder and a baker. How old is his election strategist? I assume they say basgetti instead of spaghetti, and still wear pull-up nappies at night. Yet despite the relish with which Johnson embraces cosplaying as a working man, he always seems oversized and grotesquely out of place in these scenes, as though a vast unlicensed buttock implant has just been cast in Camberwick Green.Anyway: the fridge. Back at the Modern Milkman HQ, a producer for Good Morning Britain, filming live, asked whether the programme could get a chat with the prime minister. “For fuck’s sake!” said a senior Conservative source called Rob Oxley, still live on air. At which point the prime minister scuttled into a large fridge.Time for a historical perspective, perhaps: despite having an underground bedroom as part of the war rooms complex, Boris Johnson’s hero Winston Churchill declined to sleep in it any more than four or five times in the entire second world war, including during the blitz when London was under sustained nightly bombardment. Without wishing to go out on a limb, then, it is difficult to imagine Winston Churchill fleeing a lone Pathé news camera to conceal himself inside a refrigerator. Johnson’s move forces an urgent reordering of the top three most embarrassing places British politicians have hidden because they couldn’t handle the consequences of their actions. This now goes: 3. Edinburgh pub – Nigel Farage. 2. Disabled loo – Ken Livingstone 1. Fridge – Boris Johnson.Because the smallness of the man could not be conceded, Tory campaign staff attempted to insist the interview request and the prime minister’s presence in a fridge were correlated but not causal. According to the ’s deadpan report on the matter, Conservative sources – I don’t know which ones, but “for fuck’s sake” let’s have a guess – claimed that Johnson was “categorically not hiding” in the fridge, from which he later emerged carrying a crate of milk bottles. Instead, they fucksaked, his aides were taking a moment to prep the PM for a separate, pre-agreed interview.Spellbinding. They honestly would have been better off going with something along the lines of: “As you could see from the fact he’d rather steal a phone than empathise with the picture of a sick child, the prime minister is an extremely cold man. We had word from the dairy manager that one of the units was nudging over 4 degrees and the whole batch would have to be scrapped, so we whisked the prime minister in there to lower the temperature. Hey presto – milk lollies for all. The guy’s like Elsa or something. Let’s get Brexit done and sign an ambitious trade deal with Arendelle.”For their part, for this final day, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour wanted to talk about the NHS crisis. Not sure what the costume is for that – perhaps a grim reaper’s cowl, although that would make Corbyn look like he was playing Ben Kenobi in a panto version of Star Wars. Inevitably, though, the Labour leader couldn’t help talking about the fridge. “I’ve not come here to deliver milk,” Corbyn informed a rally in Middlesbrough, “or to hide in a fridge.”Yet hilariously – and indeed malarially – the Labour party then issued a formal statement featuring the following sentence about Boris Johnson: “He is hiding in fridges to dodge interviews precisely because his fake Brexit slogans can’t stand up to scrutiny.” Oh man. Who knows whether in retrospect this will look like the moment Labour were finally defeated by Johnson’s WTF-ery? But I can’t help but notice Her Majesty’s opposition have just immediately normalised the idea of hiding in fridges as a political act, suggesting that it’s something logical a prime minister might do “precisely because” of something else, as opposed to what it is: a prime minister, of an actual country, hiding in a fridge. Guys, you can’t fit this into the old attack templates. You’re fighting a war against a fridge-hider. There aren’t any established conventions. This is frontierland – we passed the rules five fucksakes ago.And what of Britain’s next prime minister, Jo Swinson? Alas, even she was unable to dodge the fridge-iverse. I kept seeing her supporters say versions of “You know what? She’s turned up to every TV interview and debate. She’s never hidden in a fridge.” So let the record show there’s a new benchmark. Here we are. This, then, is us. On the eve of polling day for the general election of 2019, the fridge is now the black hole of UK politics. None of us can escape its event horizon, so I can’t say “see you on the other side”. In totally scientific terms, there is no other side to see you on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec52fffad4767aa66951bf28defa800852a315c6/0_245_4588_2753/master/4588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6bbaf7f3d80e211efd6ae647e506fab","title":"from a thumping tory win to a corbyn coalition four election scenarios","story":"How some of the more likely outcomes could take shape – and results to watch forAs Britain heads to the polls here are four possible scenarios for the outcome.Boris Johnson wins a landmark victory, taking 360 seats, winning over traditional Labour voters in small cities and big towns in Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, while holding steady in Scotland, London and the south of England generally.The governing party could be on track to gain even more, 50-plus seats, if it takes others talked about as being in play: Dennis Skinner’s seat of Bolsover (Lab maj 5,288), Alyn and Deeside in north Wales (Lab maj 5,235) and West Bromwich West (Lab maj 4,460).Labour would bear the brunt of losses, falling just short of 220 seats. That would be the worst election result for the party since 1983, making it difficult for Jeremy Corbyn to hang on as leader – while Johnson would have a free rein to complete Brexit at the third time of asking by 31 January.This is roughly the closest to the prevailing polling, in line with YouGov’s Tuesday prediction of a majority of 28. The Conservatives would end up with 340 seats (up 23) and Labour on 237, slightly ahead of its disappointing 2015 result, but 25 seats down on last time.Signs this is happening would be if the Conservatives gain Lincoln (Lab maj 1,538), Derby North (Lab maj 2,015), Wakefield (Lab maj 2,176) Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832), but not the seats with larger majorities mentioned in the section above.The Conservatives could afford to lose two seats in Scotland to the SNP (Stirling and Gordon) and one in London (Chipping Barnet), but would still have a good enough result to allow Boris Johnson to look forward to five years in Downing Street.After a successful pre-election purge of rebel Conservative MPs, even a majority of 10 or more could easily be sufficient for governing, particularly in completing the first phase of the UK’s exit from the EU.This familiar scenario kicks in if the Conservatives miss the 326 overall majority figure by a few seats. Boris Johnson could try for a minority government if the Conservatives end up in the low 320s, but anything in the high 310s would leave him theoretically reliant on the DUP, already unhappy with the renegotiated Brexit deal.The prime minister would remain in post while he tried to form a government, while it would be for the combined opposition parties to come up with an alternative and, if necessary, defeat him in a motion of no confidence sometime before Christmas.On this scenario, the Conservatives end up even, probably meaning that gains made in the northern half of England and all of Wales, are offset by losses elsewhere. The Tories do take seats such as Barrow and Furness (Lab maj 209) and Peterborough (Lab maj 607 at the last general election), but not Ipswich (Lab maj 831) or Stockton South (Lab maj 888) on Teesside.Labour, meanwhile, makes more gains in the south-east, taking Southampton Itchen (Con maj 31) and Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346), only loses four seats in Scotland and hangs on in Canterbury (Lab maj 187) and Stroud (Lab maj 687). Overall the party is still down, at 253 seats, but remains competitive.To complete the picture SNP gains four from the Tories, the last of which is Ochil and South Perthshire (Con maj 3,359), and the Lib Dems pick up Richmond Park (Con maj 45) in London. In Northern Ireland, gains by the SDLP in Belfast South and Foyle and by the Alliance party in North Down help with the arithmetic.It depends a little on the wider results picture, but if the Conservatives fall below the low 310s Boris Johnson could not form a government just with the DUP. The prime minister might try to talk to the SNP and the Lib Dems but the initiative would move to the opposition to see if it could form a government led by Corbyn.It is possible for Labour to lead a coalition if the party ends up with the same number of seats it has now, on 262. The party wins Norwich North (Con maj 507), gains Northampton North (Con maj 807) and Milton Keynes South (Con maj 1,725), offsetting any seat losses elsewhere.Winning Putney (Con maj 1,554) and Watford (Con maj 2,092) would be particularly helpful, as would restricting any losses to the Conservatives to a couple of seats in the north of England.The SNP also gains Angus (Con maj 2,645), the Lib Dems St Albans (Con maj 6,109) and there is a surprise win for an independent in East Devon. Beyond that there is limited headroom for the SNP, but if the Lib Dems can really pull off wins in Winchester (Con maj 9,999), or even Esher and Walton (Con maj 23,298), then the Tories are in trouble, and Boris Johnson out of a job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d8842509630b8e30b965ae80e6c5b1a3c5017a5/0_209_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e96a8ed0270c6b67b16d49f09119769","title":"have you experienced any voting issues share your stories","story":"We’d like to hear about any voting issues at polling stations or with postal votes and any other news tips that you think we should know about If you have experienced any problems with your postal vote or at the polling station, we’d like to hear from you.

As we bid farewell to the drama of the election campaign that was 2019 we recap on the digital campaign that was.The 2019 party campaigns have relied on social media messaging like no election previously with most of the larger parties pushing their messages across a variety of platforms.In the final offering in our series on the digital campaign trail we focus on the Facebook and Instagram ads which proved most successful and the Google ads which the parties used to subvert their opponents’ messages.The political parties continue to invest in Facebook, but are they getting their money’s worth?The Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats have placed in the region of 25,000 Facebook ads since the election was announced in late October. But a vanishingly small number – 48 – have been seen more than a million times. (Facebook doesn’t provide specific figures for the number of impressions an advert has received so we are working on impressions of 1m and over).Half of those – 24 – were Labour adverts. They cover a broad swathe of issues: attacking Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, offering the public a “final say” on a Labour-renegotiated Brexit deal, and promoting the economic reforms in its manifesto. The adverts will have cost the party between £350,000 and £425,000, according to Facebook’s data.The Lib Dem’ pledge to revoke the result of the EU referendum if it wins a majority is perceived by many to have damaged its electoral prospects during this campaign. But the same policy has been by far its most successful message online, with all seven of its million-plus adverts (costing over £55,000) containing a variation upon the theme of “Stop Brexit”.In other pro-remain news, the campaign group Best for Britain had seven ads viewed 1m times or more, while Led By Donkeys, best known for its guerilla poster campaign comparing the promises of pro-Brexit politicians with reality, had three.One of the million-plus adverts, run by a voter registration campaign called Inspire EU, is exclusively targeted at the 18-24 demographic, and is one of several adverts we’ve seen over the course of the election to have been steered in a very specific direction in this way.A campaign group called Working4UK, run by a businessman and Conservative local councillor, has also published a series of adverts criticising the cost of Labour party policies.The Conservatives have done less well with just four of their adverts reaching the 1m impressions mark. All four cover familiar ground: two attacking Jeremy Corbyn and two claiming a majority for the party will, yes, you’ve guessed it, “get Brexit done”.Mr and Mrs ConservativeSome of the Tories’ better-performing ads (those with 125,000 or more views) were seen exclusively by men or women.One such ad, claiming post-Brexit Britain will be the best place to “start a business”, was seen more than 125,000 times, but only by men, according to a  analysis of the Facebook ad library. Another, which promised to “unleash the potential of all our towns, cities and villages”, also had an exclusively male audience.By contrast, the text of one ad seen over 250,000 times, but only by female users, reads: “We’re recruiting 20,000 more police and giving them the powers they need to keep you safe”.Among the Labour ads targeted at one gender are three ads focusing on the party’s policy of compensating the “Waspi” women affected by a change in the state pension age. The ads, seen more than 3m times collectively, were viewed exclusively by women aged 55 and over.The Lib Dems have run at least 21 female-targeted ads, including 12 focusing on why Boris Johnson “should not be prime minister”. They even bring the Queen into it.Tories and Labour spend thousands on Google and YouTubeThe Conservatives’ spend on Google ads ramped up in the penultimate week of the campaign, more than three times higher than the previous week. This makes them the biggest spender on the platform overall, with £211,000 worth of ads placed.As well as search ads the Tories are hoping to convince young voters with a final blitz on YouTube, taking out large masthead ads on the UK homepage, one of which received 3.5m views.These prominent YouTube ads, which are recorded in the Google ad library, are thought to be very expensive and should push their overall spend much higher when we have the final Google spend data next week.The Conservatives’ search strategy has been very negative, mostly taking out ads on Labour-related keywords to attack the party and Corbyn.The most notable of these was a site which appeared to contain details about the Labour manifesto, but was in fact a Conservative attack site. At least 60 ads contained a widely debunked claim that each taxpayer would pay £2,400 extra tax under a Labour government.Labour was the second biggest spender, taking out £172,000 of ads. While Labour also placed a number of ads attacking Johnson and the Conservatives, their strategy on Google was more focused on promoting their own policies, with a number of ads linking out to the manifesto around launch day.They also clearly saw the Lib Dems as a threat, pushing the “vote Lib Dem, get Boris Johnson” message. In the last days of the campaign, Labour’s Google strategy turned to getting out the vote, taking out ads promoting their online polling station finder.After an early surge, the Brexit party’s spending has tailed off dramatically, much like their campaign, while the Lib Dems entered the race very late and spent just £11,000.Digital dashboard team: Michael Barton, Pamela Duncan, Niamh McIntyre, David Pegg and Joseph Smith"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4402606c6f48167486284dbd72946c54c51d2a4f/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95cd31eaa837a2f422dab712350006c9","title":"what the papers say as britain goes to the ballot box","story":"Electoral entreaties abound on the front pages as the UK papers herald the arrival of polling day“Corbyn urges voters to deliver ‘shock to the establishment’” says the  as Jeremy Corbyn hammers home the theme of his Labour leadership.The Sun says “If Boris wins today, a bright future begins tomorrow … but if Red Jez gets in, the lights will go out for good”, referencing a 1992 election front page in which John Major beat Neil Kinnock.

The Labour leader was “a leftwing Eurosceptic who views the EU as a capitalists’ club”, it said, “and has never admitted that leaving will jeopardise all his fine promises of a radical social and economic reform”.But the paper reserved its fiercest criticism for Johnson. “No longer the clown, the prime minister has started to show his true face,” it said. “Brutal hungry for power fleeing the public and awkward questions disregarding parliament brandishing a nationalism and an arrogance worthy of Trump.”For all Europeans, starting with Britain’s closest neighbours and partners, the French, “the entrenchment of a sort of mini-Trump, who dreams of tearing up social and environmental standards and transforming the UK into a tax haven at the doors of the continent, would be very bad news”.In its eve-of-election analysis, Libération was equally damning. This was, it said, “a different kind of election, far more than the simple renewal of a democratic parliament. Its outcome will define the country’s future for several generations.”And yet the five-week campaign had been “brutal, packed with untruths and even outright lies, bitter, devoid of substantive debate. It was also, and above all, uninspiring. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have both, for very different reasons, broken all records for unpopularity.”So will voters choose “Corbyn’s radical, hard-left programme, or the certainty of Brexit on a plate by Johnson? The two leaders both talk of uniting the country after three years of ision. But each led a deeply polarising campaign. The chance that those fractures will heal fast looks slim indeed.”And now for some London voting queues north of the river. First, in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North seat. Next in another in safe Labour seat of Hornsey and Wood Green.And third in Bethnal Green and Bow, where Labour also has a big majority.Not everyone has had to brave the cold this morning as some of our readers outside the UK have been in touch to tell us how they feel watching the election from abroad.Rory from south London is on holiday in Laos:My other half and I are on holiday on Don Det island in Laos for polling day (don’t worry – we voted by post before we left)! Luckily it will be our breakfast time as the results start pouring in so we will be readily refreshing the Politics Live blog. We were at Glastonbury in 2016 for the EU referendum and in Goa in 2016 for Trump’s election but hoping for a better result tomorrow.Phil, an English teacher in Hamburg, Germany feels a huge sense of forebodingSitting here sipping my cuppa before work as a UK national who has been outside the UK for more than 15 years feeling a huge sense of foreboding. I am disenfranchised for the first time in my life and fear what will happen to us expats under a nationalist Tory government. Please tell me the British public aren’t gonna fall for their crap again. It feels somewhat like an abusive relationship cycle.Ric, who is in his 20s and works in online gaming in Gibraltar believes this election is about Brexit:I live on the rock and sent my postal vote last week. I’m enthused by the queues at polling stations in the UK. I think this is the most important election of our generation. It’s often said that this isn’t about Brexit, but ultimately if it wasn’t for the Brexit deadlock we wouldn’t be having an election at all. Of course issues around the NHS, policing and education are important but this election is an attempt at giving us another say on Brexit. In Gibraltar we overwhelmingly voted to remain, we rely on fluidity at our border with Spain, so workers, goods, food and medicine can cross. For me, I think we need another say ... and this election is giving us that!And another  reader is at work in Shanghai:Currently sat with one eye on work and one eye on the  website watching with trepidation. Postal vote already made.While Spain has endured two inconclusive general elections this year - and remains in the hands of a caretaker government - the country is still intrigued and appalled by the UK’s own political contortions.In a dispatch from London, El Mundo’s UK correspondent, Carlos Fresneda, discerns a clear drift towards Trumpism.“They fear that, bolstered by the ballot boxes and with an absolute majority, Boris Johnson could behave like a true despot and bring about a definitive split from Europe that sees British society lurch towards the US model (after all, he was born in New York).”The paper’s leader on Thursday morning is equally blunt. The UK, it says, is “fatally fractured” as a result of Brexit and has succumbed to populism more than any other EU country. Rafael Ramos, London correspondent for La Vanguardia, has filed a report from Tony Blair’s former constituency, Sedgefield. There he finds that Labour’s once impregnable “red wall” is looking vulnerable: “A blue tsunami is on its way and it’s being ridden by the blond menace Boris on a surfboard emblazoned with the word Brexit and done out in the colours of the Union Jack.”For others, the British media’s election coverage is, as ever, a story in itself. Sergio Maydeu-Olivares, an international relations consultant, has tweeted some of Thursday’s front pages: the Scottish Sun’s call for the last person to leave Britain to snuff out the candles if Corbyn wins the Mail’s desperate plea to back Boris and the Daily Record’s call to make Scotland a Tory-free land.” The UK press is going out on a limb over Thursday’s election – and how,” he writes. “No blushes. No subtlety. Check it out …”More photos queues to vote in south London, this time in Streatham, a safe Labour seat:And another in the Tory marginal of Putney.Boris Johnson kissed his dog Dilyn after voting at Methodist Central Hall near Downing Street.More reports of long queues in South London, this time in Putney, where Justine Greening won a narrow majority of 1,554 for the Tories in 2017 but is not standing in this election. And Camberwell, in Harriet Harman’s safe Labour seat.There have also been big queues in Balham, in the London constituency of Tooting, where Labour’s Rosena Allin-Khan won a majority of 15,458 in 2017.There have been queues already in Battersea, reports Steven Swinford, the deputy political editor of the Times.Labour’s Marsha de Cordova is defending a 2,416 majority in Battersea. Voter selfie of the day so far:As this is the first December election for almost a century early voters have had to brave the dark as well as well as the cold.

There is no weighting by poll methodology, or recency, or pollster. UK-wide polls are excluded to preserve comparability. Since 13 July, Survation has conducted UK-only polls and those polls are not included in the tracker.The SNP, UKIP and Plaid Cymru are included in “others”, even where an inidual pollster breaks them out. Again, this is to preserve comparability among different polling organisations.We will update the tracker with every available poll until election day. Note that, even if the polls prove perfectly accurate, because of the UK’s first-past-the-post electoral system there may be a significant discrepancy between the national share of vote received by the parties and the number of seats allotted to them in the House of Commons.Remember, too, that on the day before the general election in 2017 most pollsters were predicting a Conservative majority, in some cases of as many as 82 seats.

But the latest finding is exceptional as it is more than twice as old as any previously known narrative scenes and hints at ancient myths and an early capacity for imagination.“It suggested to us that this extraordinary scene suggests a story or some kind of myth,” said Brumm.The 4.5-metre-wide panel shows six fleeing mammals – two Sulawesi warty pigs and four dwarf buffaloes, known as anoas, small but fierce animals that still inhabit the island’s dwindling forests. The animals are being pursued by human-like figures with some animal features (academics call these therianthropes), who seem to be wielding long swords or ropes. Their bodies are human-shaped but one appears to have the head of a bird and another has a tail.Human-animal hybrids occur in the folklore of almost every modern society and are frequently cast as gods, spirits or ancestral beings in religions across the world.“The most fascinating aspect is it has all the key elements of modern human cognition,” said Prof Maxime Aubert, an archaeologist at Australia’s Griffith University. “Hand stencils, a narrative scene, human-like figures that were conceived of something that doesn’t really exist in the real world. Everything is there by 44,000 years ago.”The cave is in a well-explored system, which researchers had visited frequently over the past decade. The discovery was made after an expedition member noticed what appeared to be an entrance to a high level chamber above and climbed up a fig tree to investigate. “And then, bang, there’s this incredible new rock art site in there that’s essentially like nothing we’ve ever seen before in this entire region,” said Brumm.Rock art is difficult to date, and the scientists relied on analysing mineral growths known as cave popcorn, that had formed over the painting. Measuring the radioactive decay of uranium and other elements in the deposits gave dates ranging from 35,100 to 43,900 years as a minimum age for the Sulawesi discovery. The findings are described in the journal Nature.“It’s just amazing and to me it just shows how much more rock art that is out there waiting to be discovered that completely changes our understanding of the human story,” said Brumm.Before this latest discovery, the oldest undisputed examples of figurative cave art date to about 35,000 years old. The oldest cave art on record is abstract forms attributed to Neanderthals, which have been dated to 64,000 years old. The art features lines, dots and animal-like shapes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b24f3cf32e23c75a9f66c5e4663c19fffd344156/0_69_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f5123e73c7a3ced3903cd3bdd3cf3e6","title":"hendrix hepburn study busts myths about origins of uks parakeets","story":"Researchers find no single hotspot but signs of owners releasing birds in health scaresTheir bright green feathers and unmistakable squawk make ring-necked parakeets a striking addition to British park wildlife, but the question of how the tropical birds were first introduced has been a subject of contention.One urban legend traces their origin to a pair released by Jimi Hendrix on Carnaby Street in 1968 another suggests they arrived in 1951 when Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn visited London with various animals in tow to film The African Queen, set in the equatorial swamps of east Africa.Now the question has been subjected to a rigorous forensic analysis for the first time, in research that points to an entirely different explanation: pet owners around the country releasing the birds into the wild, possibly prompted by media coverage of fatal “parrot fever” outbreaks.Steven Le Comber, who led the research at Queen Mary University London, said: “The ring-necked parakeet has become a successful invasive species in 34 countries on five continents. The fun legends relating to the origins of the UK’s parakeets are probably not going to go away any time soon.”However, analysis by Le Comber and colleagues based on geographic profiling methods used to track down criminals concluded that Britain’s booming parakeet population has grown from numerous small-scale accidental and intentional pet releases.The analysis tested other popular theories, including that parakeets kept at Syon Park in west London escaped in the 1970s when a plane crashed through the aviary roof, or that damage to aviaries during the Great Storm of 1987 was responsible. However, none of the suspect sites showed up prominently in the heatmap of more than 5,000 unique records dating from 1968 to 2018.The research, published in the journal Zoology Letters, drew on sightings recorded in the National Bioersity Network Atlas dating back to the 1960s. When this failed to produce an obvious hotspot of parrot activity, the researchers turned to newspaper archives, and a search turned up thousands of pages of news stories about parakeets written between 1804 and 2008.The team found numerous sensational accounts of human deaths due to so-called parrot fever, an infection called psittacosis, which has the potential to be passed from bird to human and which can be deadly. In 1932 the Middlesex County Times reported that parakeets had been spotted in Epping Forest and credited the “parrot disease scare” of 1931 for an increase in pet birds being released into the wild.A 1952 headline in London’s Daily Herald reported calls to “Stop import of danger parrots”, while a 1974 report in the Reading Evening Post described eight people falling sick after the death of a parrot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fe674e95e2262c6f43181302563731686826346/0_19_2954_1773/master/2954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=983f3ad5ebe3bfed497b574a300b5eae","title":"james harden cristiano ronaldo","story":"The Rockets superstar has a kindred spirit in the Juventus frontman, bound by a robotic ruthlessness that will never win over the masses beyond the confines of their home arenasNot even his most ardent critics – and there are plenty of them – dispute James Harden’s greatness. His numbers are undeniable, he efficacy is unimpeachable, and his continued evolution, still adding wrinkles to his game at 30, is inspiring.Yet it’s unlikely the Houston Rockets guard will ever be universally adored, at least not to the extent of a LeBron James or even a Stephen Curry. It is a question of style, rather than substance, that prevents so many basketball fans truly taking Harden into their heart. And, in this regard, there are parallels to be drawn between the NBA scoring machine and soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo.Of course, Rockets fans worship Harden, just as supporters of Juventus and Real Madrid, Ronaldo’s current and former club respectively, idolize the Portuguese forward. Fans inside the Toyota Center have watched Harden blossom from the perennial sixth man traded from Oklahoma City to escape the shadows of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook in 2012 into an MVP, a one-man offensive juggernaut they’ve seen the work that has gone into that potential being realized.And they appreciate – just as Madridistas knew Ronaldo’s inidual output guaranteed team success – that they will always have a championship-caliber offense as long as Harden is on board.But the robotic ruthlessness of both men’s scoring won’t, in itself, win over the masses beyond the confines of their home arenas.Harden and Ronaldo are elite scorers in their respective sports, employing a volume approach to posting historical points and goals returns. Ronaldo has taken more shots than any other player in Serie A this season, and it was largely the same story throughout his time in Spain, where he scored a frankly ridiculous 450 goals from 438 games across nine seasons with Real Madrid.It is unquestionable, then, that Harden and Ronaldo are scoring machines whose mere presence elevates their teams to the level of title contenders. But, for many fans, it is their almost mechanical approach to their craft which grates.Non-Houston-supporting basketball lovers seem to find Harden’s perceived manufacturing of fouls unpalatable and plainly not fun to watch. Likewise, Ronaldo has often been accused of trying to buy favorable decisions by dramatically overreacting to any contact.Their dedication to sharpening every technical tool at their disposal – be it Harden’s step-back three-point shot or Ronaldo’s dominant heading ability – has to be admired. But such repeated, rehearsed moves don’t quite elicit the same joy as something that feels altogether more improvised, such as a staccato Lionel Messi dribble past four players or a behind-the-head Luka Dončić assist.Harden and Ronaldo’s stylistic similarities extend to their weaknesses, too. Both have, throughout their careers, tended to offer little on the defensive end. There are YouTube compilations of Harden letting opponents ghost by him, and Ronaldo, when his team is out of possession, is permitted to hold a high position away from the defensive action, conserving energy. Harden, to his credit, has shown improvements in this area: his 2.0 steals per game is good for a tie of third-best in the league, for example.A large portion of the distaste many fans feel towards Ronaldo, it must be said, is a result of his preening public image and perceived self-obsession – not to mention, more recently, lingering allegations sexual of assault. The Harden hate is not nearly as personal.But purely in terms of what they do on the venue of play, the main area in which they differ is the fact that Ronaldo has consistently delivered silverware for his teams, while Harden is yet to win an NBA title. The Portuguese, who has won the Champions League – European club football’s most-coveted prize – five times, is widely regarded as one of soccer’s great big-game players. Even some of Messi’s strongest advocates will quietly admit that, if it came down to a choice between the two for a single, high-stakes game, they’d plump for Ronaldo.Harden, on the other hand, is plagued by some notable post-season faux pas, such as the time he struggled to impact the 2012 finals off the bench for OKC versus the Miami Heat, or his wasteful showing in Game 5 of the 2015 Western Conference finals against Golden State.But both assertions are slightly unfair. Although Ronaldo has certainly impacted many key fixtures throughout his career, it could be argued that he has only produced one truly great performance in his five Champions League finals – against Juventus in 2017. And Harden has scored 40 or more points in eight play-off games, a figure only James and Durant can better among active players.Like 34-year-old Ronaldo, Harden will be more resistant to age decline than many of his peers his ability to create separation or generate free-throw opportunities can withstand waning athleticism, and a drop in speed shouldn’t hurt the output of a player who preferred a slightly slower pace to begin with.Longevity will be another feather in Harden’s cap, and it will allow him to stay in the mix for MVP races and scoring titles long into his thirties. But still, in the eyes of many, there will be something missing.Conspicuous by its absence is the artistry of James or Messi reading a developing play to make assists no one else sees, or the ethereal, uplifting quality found in the improvisation of Dončić or Kylian Mbappé. It is these moments of unimaginable brilliance, beyond the craft of fine-tuned technique and brutal efficiency, that elevate players to the echelon of the adored.Harden was crowned the regular-season MVP for 2017-18 he probably should have won the award the year before, too. And Ronaldo has won soccer’s most-prestigious inidual award, the Ballon d’Or, five times. They are suitably recognized, respected and revered for what they do. The adulation that spreads beyond the borders of tribal fandom, though, is reserved for the magic of Messi, the genius of LeBron."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ba00480453c0ef0d3fd9a68e13b4be01ec2bc01/0_85_4217_2530/master/4217.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ad04f071c3f3968c2f8588e7758794","title":"australia v new zealand first test day one live","story":"54th over: Australia 143-2 (Labuschagne 61, Smith 21) The dropped catch doesn’t get better on replay, Latham’s disappointment palpable. “Next one!” says Watling, as is the custom. But with Smith being Smith, might that be in 24 hours from now? Smith hits Santner hard and straight but Umpire Llong’s boot stops an otherwise certain boundary. What a sport. Labuschagne then picks up a couple through cover. It might be nearing the break but after a dropped catch, this might be the time to pile in and punch the bruise. 53rd over: Australia 140-2 (Labuschagne 59, Smith 20) Rapid running from this indefatigable pair, scampering back for three at top gear after Labuschagne flicks out towards the midwicket rope. It’s still the better aprt of 40 degrees out there. Oh no! SMITH DROPPED AT SECOND SLIP from the final ball. It was to Latham’s left but he went right - didn’t pick it up at all, going quickly to him from a miscued cut. Still, he had to take it. Ferguson is denied a first Test wicket as a consequence. After a tight session, that hurts a lot. 52nd over: Australia 136-2 (Labuschagne 56, Smith 19) Back to Santner now with 20 minutes until the short break. If you weren’t following earlier, they have reversed the usual day-night intervals for this Perth fixture because of, I can only assume, the TV news bulletins. So, we’re back to normal - kinda. Smith might never have batted so slowly in Test cricket for this number of balls (I’ll check at tea), but he adds two here off his pads. That’s his lot. 51st over: Australia 134-2 (Labuschagne 56, Smith 17) Shot! Smith might be the senior man out there but you wouldn’t know it from the way Labuschagne is striking the ball, leaning onto the front foot to drive Southee straight down the ground on this occasion. Granted, two balls earlier he was beaten on the inside edge again by the New Zealand veteran, but when contact is made, it’s sweet as can be. The TV tells me that Labuschagne is averaging 83 in his last ten Test hits.50th over: Australia 130-2 (Labuschagne 52, Smith 17) Ferguson bangs it in short at Labuschagne to start his fresh set but a long way from the lid, giving the number three enough room to lift him safely over the cordon for his eighth boundary. And with that, he moves to another Test half-century. What a year this man has had from the moment he was called off the bench as Test cricket’s first concussion sub at Lord’s. Nobody has more runs than him this year and he’s now well on his way to a third ton on the trot this season for Australia. 49th over: Australia 125-2 (Labuschagne 47, Smith 17) Southee is still generating plenty of swing with the pink ball. He’s straight to Labuschagne in the first instance, a clipped single to midwicket bringing this partnership to 50. But to Smith the radar is well outside the off. They’re patient with him, bowling to a plan. Tick, tick. 48th over: Australia 124-2 (Labuschagne 46, Smith 17) The full body experience that is Lockie Ferguson is back into the attack. As the radar graphic shows, he is far and away the quickest of the Kiwi bowlers so far today, hitting 145 clicks in both spells so far. I’m a bit flat that he’s shelved his black boots, but you can’t have it all. Banging it in short of a length, Smith tucks one before Labuschagne does the same to finish. He’s uncharacteristically slow making it down the other end, prompting an appeal when the stumps are hit direct. Umpire Llong sends it upstairs but he’s comfortably in. “Southee, Boult, Ferguson \u0026amp Wagner might just be the finest quartet of outfielders the test fast-bowling scene has ever seen,” writes Ben Bernards, questioning Geoff’s earlier charactertisation of Wagner’s snaffle. “Screamers galore amongst that lot over the years, Southee \u0026amp Boult especially since they’ve been around the longest obvs.”Yup. If putting together a bracket on the best fielders in world cricket, Boult is at the very least in the semi-final. It’s not worth much now, but the most underrated part of the World Cup Final was his collect on the final ball of the 100th over to complete the run out.47th over: Australia 122-2 (Labuschagne 45, Smith 16) Two strong shouts for LBW to start the Southee set, both beating Labuschagne on the inside edge with decent movement off the seam. But Umpire Dar keeps his finger down and Captain Williamson correctly assesses the deliveries to be going over the top. Even so, they are high-quality dots after a couple of productive overs for Australia. This New Zealand team don’t lose their bundle. Ohhh, and to finish the Aussie number three throws his hands at a conventional outswinger well outside the off-stump, beating the blade on the way through. Hmm.“Colin DeGrandhomme is swiftly becoming my favourite player,” says tom V d Gucht. “His control of line and length paired with his muscular batting making him an undervalued player. He always seems to get unfairly referred to in the press as, “agricultural” or, “cross-batted” or receive digs about him fluking his wickets due to his, “lack of pace” confusing batsmen who are used to facing better bowling. Give the guy a break!” This is a good take. Big fan, me.46th over: Australia 122-2 (Labuschagne 45, Smith 16) That’s Smith at his best, leaning forward to clip Santner through midwicket with precision placement. Four lovely runs. “You just sense Australia are getting the momentum back,” says Ian Smith on the telly. Having been on radio at home for the Pakistan Tests, this is the first I’ve seen of the Fox coverage this summer. I couldn’t have picked a better time to start this stint with Smith, Isa Guha and Kerry O’Keeffe on duty. 45th over: Australia 118-2 (Labuschagne 45, Smith 12) Southee gives Labuschagne enough time to get deep in the crease, whipping three to square leg start the new over. Nice timng. After absorbing a couple of dots, Smith turns a straighter offering to long leg for one. Labuschagne keeps the board ticking with another fine shot, chopping down hard on a cut in front of point, racing away for four. Has he played a false stroke this summer? Not that I’ve seen. 44th over: Australia 110-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 11) Santner is back after the understandably long drinks break. He keeps Smith at bay, calling his familiar “wait on” then “not now” and so on. He changed bats during the breather - a response, no doubt, to his quiet start. At Smith’s best, he’s 20-odd before you look up. Today, he’s 11 from 64. A maiden here makes it 18 runs from the last ten overs.Hello! Thanks, Geoff. As I was just gibbering on twitter, this is the first home Australian Test I’ve missed in six years. Blimey. But I wouldn’t want to be anywhere other than  Towers at Kings Cross for the duration of this series. So, drop me a line. G’morning. 43rd over: Australia 110-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 11) Short cover and quite a close gully for de Grandhomme against Labuschagne, who lashes a full ball straight to that short cover man. Then an error from the bowler, on leg stump and Marnus glances four to fine leg. That makes life easier. Overpitched next up, and a perfect straight drive, but the bowler does well in his follow-through to get enough on it and stop that ball.That’s drinks after an absorbing day so far, and that marks the time to hand over to your friend and mine, Adam Collins.42nd over: Australia 106-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 11) Santner on for more spin. Interesting move from Williamson. A lot of loop from Santner. Just a single for Marnus to the leg side. 41st over: Australia 105-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 11) The job for de Grandhomme has been to bowl outside the off stump and tie the scoring up. Which is exactly what he does, except he’s bowling to Steve Smith. Somehow Smith finds his first boundary of the day, walking so far across his stumps that he can glance de Grandhomme from outside off stump through fine leg for four. Rude. 40th over: Australia 101-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 7) Smith with the wide reaching drive again, and absolutely nails it, but straight to mid-off for a dot ball. Eventually nudges a single to point, not his preferred spot.Ok, this is bloody adorable from Ricky Ponting. He’s finally joined Twitter in the last couple of days and was ribbed about it on air. He said that he and his wife had decided that since their daughters were likely to be on social media in the next few years, he thought he should understand what the platforms are and how they work. 39th over: Australia 100-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 6) Colin de Grandhomme continues, and his disciplined line continues too. He draws a false shot from Marnus, off the inside half away through the leg side, then another slight miscue from Smith fending away a short ball to leg. Two singles result.38th over: Australia 98-2 (Labuschagne 32, Smith 5) A couple of decent shots from Labuschagne but straight to the field. He’s remained very positive even while Smith has been more circumspect. Finally he goes get a shot away with a cut, when Wagner gets too wide, but it only yields a single.37th over: Australia 97-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 5) Smith keeps stepping across to de Grandhomme, trying to wrist him away but not able to time the ball to the leg side. Just one of those slippery type bowlers, hard to get onto. Then there’s some serious bounce from de Grandhomme that zips past Smith’s bat! Made him jump. Smith blocks out rather than looking to score. A maiden. He’s faced 40 balls for his 5 runs thus far. 36th over: Australia 97-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 5) Smith is still settling, and Wagner helps with a short ball down leg that Smith can pull easily enough for a single. Twice then Wagner tests out Labuschagne with the yorker. The bowler’s famous endurance is on display today, with the temperature approaching 39.35th over: Australia 96-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 4) Colin de Grandhomme is back with his mediums. Swing! And bounce. His first ball careers through past Labuschagne’s push. It’s swerving away from the batsman. Movement all day so far. What might the pink ball do under lights here in Perth? The bowler overpitches, undoing some of his good work as Labuschagne drives through cover for four. Out of his crease, Labuschagne lunges down at the ball to punish it. 34th over: Australia 92-2 (Labuschagne 27, Smith 4) Slightly sheepish from Wagner after he leaps up in a huge appeal for lbw, which was optimistic given that Marnus had played the angled ball off the full face of the bat for a single through point. Smith starts outside leg stump to the lefty, ends up outside off stump. Two men out on the hook, plus a leg slip and a midwicket. Two slips, gully, cover, mid off. Short ball, shocks him! Smith flinches, as Wagner snorts one up that seeks out his gloves, up in front of his collarbone. No bat-pad in catching, could have been into play. This is a terrific spell from Wagner. 33rd over: Australia 91-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 4) Ferguson bowls, and Smith chases again! Beautiful bowling from Ferguson, back of a length and swinging before seaming away. Smith is shaping to defend off the back foot, then is drawn by the movement into pushing at that ball. It moves too much to take the edge though. That’s uncharacteristic of Smith to follow the ball. He got out that way twice to Morne Morkel in Cape Town while his world was falling apart. The extra bounce did for him, I suspect. Then a brilliant bit of fielding from Raval saves four at midwicket as Smith flicks away, and nearly runs him out as well with a quick throw back at the striker’s end. A maiden for Ferguson.32nd over: Australia 91-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 4) Steve Smith is really moving across his stumps now, defending with both feet well outside off by the time he steps around. At one stage though he can’t help chasing the wide one, reaching well outside the line of his body and lacing the ball, but straight to cover. 31st over: Australia 90-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 3) Ferguson gets through a tidy over, which might help settle his nerves. The more ominous interpretation is that this is just Smith settling into his work, taking a few overs to feel comfortable at the crease and assess the conditions. Four times Smith blocks or leaves before taking his usual run.30th over: Australia 89-2 (Labuschagne 26, Smith 2) Wagner still bowling a full length, very little short stuff early, though that has been suggested as a possible tactic against Smith. Instead Smith just tucks his trademark single, and Labuschagne flays the only slightly short ball through backward point for four.29th over: Australia 84-2 (Labuschagne 22, Smith 1) Good captaincy from Williamson, getting Ferguson back on after hitting refresh, after Ferguson was expensive and a bit wayward in his first spell. He starts with a good ball, beating Marnus outside off, but also offers an overpitched one that the batsman drives straight for four. 28th over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 18, Smith 1) Ok, I lied. That was the long break. It’s impossible to tell in this day-night format. Presumably they schedule the long break first in Perth so that it matches up with the TV news on the east coast of Australia. Wagner has the ball first, and nearly has Smith miscuing another low full toss to mid-off. It worked for Warner. Smith survives though, and gets off the mark with a nudge. Labuschagne chases a wide one to drive three. A session that New Zealand have just about kept themselves in. They looked in trouble early when Ferguson was going for runs and Warner was hungry, but Burns had a fairly scratchy time and eventually was given out – it looked dead when viewed live – and Warner eventually found an unlucky dismissal. Smith and Labuschagne are a pretty intimidating duo for bowlers these days though, and they’re the major obstacle that must be removed in the second session for New Zealand to have a chance. Batting should get easier as the ball gets older. The short break comes first in day-night cricket, then we’ll have the longer meal break after the second session. See you soon.27th over: Australia 76-2 (Labuschagne 15, Smith 0) Time to bunker down for Australia, with a couple of minutes until the tea break. Labuschagne leaves Southee with the sabre style a couple of times, then digs back a yorker to the bowler. A wide is the only score from the over. That’s tea. 26th over: Australia 75-2 (Labuschagne 15, Smith 0) A wicket-maiden for Wagner, who starts with two bouncers against Smith.

A wise decision, given the fractious national mood. Instead, Marmion’s fifth panto in a row at the Oxford Playhouse turned out to be a song-packed feast of fun, with a tremendously energetic cast cranking the momentum up to a furious pace.In place of topicality, Marmion dribbles a few classics through the show. Some nifty shadow play sets the scene at the beginning of each half, and the Beast – when he appears – is a Gruffalo-style giant puppet on stilts, with a detachable claw that shoots in and out of the early scenes. There’s a clever bit involving the Beast’s flaming red eyes just as the curtain falls for the interval – “mildly terrifying”, according to my nine-year-old.Much more up her street was the way Belle (Roseanna Frascona) was self-assertive and empowered – very much in the modern Disney mode – even suggesting to the prince (Matthew Staite) that she might prefer him in monster form. Brian the Orangutan (Ricky Oakley) and the mayor-turned-fox (Adrianna Bertola) also got the children in the audience on side – especially judging by the pair of kids hauled up on stage for a little friendly melon racing. Philip Pellew’s teapot-shaped Dame had the youngsters giggling, and gothic sorceress Witch Kardashia (Dev Joshi) induced a shock or two in the little ’uns.Best of all, perhaps, was the infectious song and dance that formed the bulk of the show: 80s classics such as Toto’s Africa and Katrina and the Waves’s Walking on Sunshine did a lot of the work, but the presence of Iggy Pop was a bit of a leftfield surprise. By the end, the nine-year-old was jigging and clapping with reckless abandon, which is the ultimate tribute.• At the Oxford Playhouse until 12 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/772307ecb4d794c0560d6fbd64ac000a86a9bb88/264_268_4072_2444/master/4072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4d4b24b5fb412b6714c5170055acca","title":"ring alarm review amazon diy wireless home security system","story":"DIY wireless home security system is a great alarm that’s smart enough without trying to do too muchAmazon’s new Ring Alarm smartens up the traditional home security system without radically changing how it works, combining the best of both worlds into a DIY-friendly wireless alarm arrangement that just works.It’s been a 16-month wait in the UK since the Ring Alarm line of products launched in the US in July 2018, but it has been worth it.The Ring Alarm takes the “if it ain’t broke” approach to a smart alarm system. Take a traditional alarm system, make it wireless and inject a bit of smart into it without trying to do too much and making it over-complicated.The system comes in a kit with one contact sensor, one motion detector, a keypad, a range extender and the base station, which connects to your home wifi and contains a very loud siren. It’s enough to get you started, but if you have more than one entry door or ground-floor windows, you will probably need at least one more contact sensor or motion detector.The Ring Alarm is a DIY, wireless solution, which makes it rental-friendly. You can screw everything in place if you want or, as I did, simply stick the various bits in place with foam fixers.Installation was surprisingly straightforward and easy. You’ll need a Ring account, and its app on your smartphone, which guides you through the whole process. Plug the base station into power and hook it up to your home network via ethernet or wifi.Then it’s simply a process of pulling the battery tabs out of the various bits one by one and choosing where to put them. The whole lot can be done in about 15 minutes if you know where you want everything to go.The system uses the Z-Wave wireless protocol, not wifi, to connect to the various different components, reaching up to 76 metres from the base station. A range extender is included in the kit, but each device works as its own range extender, so unless you live in a really big house or have thick walls and obstructions, you probably won’t need it.The user-replaceable 3V lithium batteries in the contact and motion sensors should last about three years, while the rechargeable battery in the keypad lasts between six and nine months. It can also be left plugged into the microUSB power adapter if you have a plug socket where you want it mounted.The keypad arms and disarms the system like any traditional alarm. Type in your four-digit pin and press the “Away” button, which triggers a 60-second timer accompanied by a red light and what sounds like a game-show countdown tone for you to get out the door. Both the keypad and the base station make a noise and flash to let you know what’s going on during arming or disarming.When you come home, simply punch in your pin and hit the “Disarm” button before the entry delay timer runs out. There’s also a “Home” mode for when you’re staying in, which arms only the contact sensors by default. The LED ring on the base station shines red when the alarm is set or blue when it’s off.The keypad charges via microUSB and can be mounted practically anywhere. I stuck it to the wall behind the front door for convenience.The alarm worked faultlessly in my two-month test, going off when it should and not when it shouldn’t. The motion sensors weren’t errantly triggered by flashes of light, as some can be. You can also tailor the motion sensor sensitivity to stop it being activated by pets – though as my home is pet-free, I couldn’t test how well this works with cats or dogs.As a basic, easy-to-install wireless alarm, the system excels, but it’s also a little bit smarter than most.You can control the whole thing from the Ring app, which means you can arm and disarm it remotely. You can get notifications when things happen, see the states of various sensors such as when a door was opened or closed, see battery levels of the various bits, and change settings such as brightness of LEDs or volume level of alerts.One of the best features is the ability to give everyone their own pin, which means you can see who armed or disarmed the alarm and when. That includes guest codes, handy for neighbours or tradespeople, which can be set to operate on a schedule for extra security.The alarm system can also integrate with any other Ring products you might have. You can set cameras to record, floodlights to fire up and other bits when the delay entry or alarm is triggered.The Ring Alarm works just fine without a monthly subscription, but a Ring Protect Plus subscription of £8 a month or £80 a year adds two extras. The first is a 3G backup connection that activates when your internet goes down, meaning the alarm still works when there’s a power cut.The second is optional assisted monitoring. When the alarm goes off, Ring’s automated system phones through a list of people until it gets an answer.One Ring Protect Plus subscription works with all Ring devices in your house, so if you have cameras, you get 30 days of video events and snapshots as well as a few other things.It’s worth noting that Ring is under scrutiny for the way it links with police in the US, and the use of its Neighbors app, and the use by users of footage captured by its cameras. As with any smart device, whether or not you should use it comes down to whether you trust the manufacturer – in this case Amazon. The alarm system potentially raises fewer privacy concerns, however, as it doesn’t need cameras to operate.The Ring Alarm starter kit costs £249 in the UK or $199 in the US. Additional contact sensors cost £29$20, motion sensors cost £39$30 and keypads cost £59$50.For comparison, smart alarm systems from traditional manufacturers such as Yale start at £150 for the most basic kits and scale quickly with the number of sensors, sirens and keypads required.The Ring Alarm manages something that few smart home devices do: it’s a simple, effective product that isn’t worse just because it’s smart.Day to day, you can just use the simple, quality-looking keypad and go about your day. It’s easy to install, rental-friendly, straightforward to use and adaptable to various needs. It doesn’t try to do too much, it’s just a good alarm in and of itself, and doesn’t need a single other Ring product to work well.The Ring app is also well-designed, responsive and works reliably - something that can’t be said of some more established competitors. The smart bits, such as being able to get alerts when things happen, remotely control the alarm and review events from inidual sensors, are good too, as is the ability to generate unique pins for guests or tradespeople.Having a backup battery in everything, plus the option of backup 3G, also means the alarm is dependable, even if the power goes out. I felt an extra-level of reassurance having the Ring Alarm system installed and armed compared to just having smart cameras set up while on a recent holiday.Start integrating other smart devices you have in your home and you can build some really sophisticated security systems.One thing the Ring Alarm kit and components are not is cheap - at least in the UK, where it is significantly more expensive than in the US. Competitors from traditional security firms start cheaper, but scale in a similar way with inidual sensors.If you want a simple DIY wireless alarm that’s easy to install and use, but you also want to be able to monitor it remotely and for it to be smart without being overloaded, Ring’s Alarm is an excellent option that was worth waiting for.Pros: wireless, effective, simple to install, rental-friendly, smart but not complicated, works as well as a traditional alarm, expandable, dependable, good app, inidual pins, temporary pins, integrates with other smart devices and camerasCons: costs bit more than competitors, contact and motion sensors are fairly large, no keyfobNFC option"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bae2b1ddb087880ce7645e151531bb1f9ad6876c/0_35_1680_1008/master/1680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=007de6d8751364411dfba8025f4e470c","title":"best new european rail journeys 2020 vienna brussels berlin","story":"Timetables for the year ahead highlight new day and night services across Europe to destinations including Vienna, Brussels and Berlin, with easy connections into eastern EuropeAnd now for some good news … rail operators across Europe are responding to a growing interest in travel by train with the launch of a number of new services. Particularly exciting for fans of sleeper trains is the launch of several new overnight services, in a welcome reversal of a recent trend among operators to drop night trains.The switchover to new 2020 timetables takes place in the early hours of Sunday 15 December (though not all services will start on that exact date: some only start in the new year or spring 2020).Previous years have seen the launch of new European high-speed lines, such as the new fast links from Paris to Strasbourg and Bordeaux, and a bold new high-speed line through the hill country of Thuringia, bringing travel time from Berlin to Munich down to four hours.The are no route openings for 2020 but the new timetables demonstrate how European rail operators are developing new services to make optimal use of existing infrastructure. Notable among them is Österreichische Bundesbahnen (OBB), Austria’s main rail operator, which is expanding its network of daytime trains (branded Railjet or Eurocity) and overnight trains (Nightjet). In doing so, it establishes Vienna as the best-connected city by rail in Europe in 2020. Only Moscow comes close in having connections to so many other European capitals.15 hoursLaunches 20 January 2020In the last few years many European sleeper trains have been phased out, so OBB’s launch of new overnight services is a welcome introduction. In 2019, the company started to offer new overnight services between many cities across Europe – all served by comfortable sleeping cars, many with optional en suite facilities. New services included overnight links from Berlin to cities in Poland, Austria, Slovakia and Hungary. Now the spotlight is on Belgium, with direct twice-weekly night trains from Brussels to Vienna, Munich and Innsbruck.By the end of 2020, these new services will be running every night, which is great news for UK passengers looking to connect with Europe’s night train network on the Eurostar via Brussels. The new services make it easier to reach Tirolean resorts and cities such as Vienna and Budapest by train. It will be possible to leave London after lunch and, with just two changes of train (Brussels and Vienna), be in Romania or Serbia by the following afternoon.Other new night trains on the horizon for later in 2020 include direct services from Amsterdam to Bavaria, the Austrian Tirol and Vienna.7 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberOBB is also expanding its daytime services, with a new daily Railjet service from Vienna via Salzburg and Innsbruck to Bolzano, capital of the largely German-speaking Südtirol region of Italy, an area with strong eco-credentials where visitors are encouraged to explore by public transport. This will be the first time OBB’s smart, red Railjet trains have run on regular scheduled services over the Brenner Pass into Italy. The company’s twice-daily services from Vienna to Venice via the classic Semmering route through the Alps have been a big success, so the launch of comfortable Railjets over the mountainous Brenner line looks set to be a winner.11 hoursLaunches 4 MayEarly May will see the launch of a new daily Railjet train from Graz, Austria’s arty second city, via Vienna and Prague, to Dresden and Berlin. This will be the first time that scheduled Railjet stock has run regularly into eastern Germany, with the reinstatement of direct trains between Saxony and Austria. This new train is in addition to the two Berlin to Vienna trains introduced in 2018, both of which take quite different routes from the Railjet: the night train running via Wrocław and Ostrava, and the daytime service via Erfurt and Regensburg.9 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberThe number of direct daily trains from Vienna to Debrecen in eastern Hungary will be increased with a second daily Eurocity service. The new train will leave Vienna at 10.42 each morning (complementing the existing late-afternoon departure) and continue beyond Debrecen to Satu Mare in northern Romania. This is the gateway to the forested Maramureș region, famed for its wooden churches and ancient traditions. This new service is branded Eurocity by ÖBB, and it’s one of a number of new launches this month. Another adventurous new service is a daily train from Graz to Przemyśl, gateway to the south-eastern Carpathian region of Poland. The last stop before the border with Ukraine, from Przemyśl there are onward services to Lviv, Kyiv and many other Ukrainian cities.Not all the rail action is with ÖBB. Here are three examples of other new services that start this month4 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberFor years, there have been few fast train services in Germany between Saxony, in the east, and the Baltic coast. That changes with the launch of a new direct Deutsche Bahn (DB) Inter-City (IC) service from Dresden via Berlin to Rostock. The route will be served by four or five trains in each direction from 15 December, increasing to eight in March 2020. In May next year, the route will be extended north from Rostock to the coastal resort of Warnemünde.Various times and datesIn the UK, the most notable timetable change is a major revamp of schedules out of London Paddington on the main Great Western Railway route to Bristol, south-west England and Wales. Highlights include regular sub-two-hour timings from London to Cardiff. The fastest trains will dash to the Welsh capital in 102 minutes, making just two stops (Bristol Parkway and Newport). The new headline timing from London to Bristol Parkway will be just 68 minutes.4 hoursLaunches 15 DecemberThis isn’t a new route, but from mid-December trains will no longer be routed via the rail-ferry link from Puttgarden (Germany) to Rødby (Denmark). Instead, these Eurocity trains, run by Danish national operator DSB, will go via the Jutland route, and Odense, to reach the Danish capital. It’ll be 18 minutes faster but won’t quite have the romance of the entire train shipped onto a ferry to Denmark.This is an extract from Hidden Europe magazine.Nicky Gardner is co-author of Europe by Rail: The Definitive Guide.

Then her brutal death – in chains – caused outrage. The star talks about the highs and lows of GoT – and feeling liberated by the Four Weddings remakeNathalie Emmanuel arrives mildly flustered. There’s been a last minute change of plans and, as we walk, she talks about a disappointing meal she had the night before at one of her favourite vegan restaurants. As she sits down in a London cafe with a matcha almond latte, I wonder if this could this be the start of a showbiz rant. But it soon becomes obvious that that isn’t Emmanuel’s style. Despite spending much of the past decade in what many consider the greatest TV series ever, Game of Thrones, she’s warm and unpretentious, quickly telling me she picked up her fancy, gled jumper at a discount sale.Emmanuel first blazed into the show’s blood-soaked, power-crazed, meteorologically challenged universe in season three, playing Missandei, who is freed from slavery by Daenerys, the Dragon Queen. She becomes Daenerys’s unwaveringly loyal and ridiculously capable handmaiden: she speaks 19 languages, which is impressive, even if they are all made up. The two characters swiftly become close, so close that Emmanuel once felt obliged to deny that the pair were going to end up in bed. Unlike pretty much every other character in GoT, Missandei made it to season eight, the final one, sparking up a romance with eunuch warrior Grey Worm along the way – before her eventual beheading in chains, which caused a storm, given she was the show’s only long-running woman of colour.In a rather different vein, her latest project is the US miniseries Four Weddings and a Funeral, from showrunner Mindy Kaling of The Office and The Mindy Project fame. Set in London and based on Richard Curtis’s romcom bumblefest, the show is, says Emmanuel, “a breath of fresh air”. Its Notting Hill palaces are slightly different from where she grew up, by the sea in Southend, Essex. Born to mixed-race parents of Dominican and St Lucian heritage, Emmanuel had by the age of 10 broken out of the local am-dram scene and was already performing in The Lion King in London’s West End. By 17, she was in teatime staple Hollyoaks, moving to Liverpool to take up the role, being snapped on red carpets in the sort of OTT dresses teenage girls now wear to school proms, her curls slicked back with thick gel. There are pap shots of her from then, too, sporting Uggs and heavily flat-ironed hair.It wasn’t just sartorial experiments that were going on. Having been “so protected” by her parents, she was now working six days a week, filing tax returns and playing a heroin-addicted character, Sasha. She recalls one particularly stressful day on set. “I came into work and somebody was really unwell, so we shot a different scene. It was when my mum died in the show. I was like, ‘Hang on a minute!’ I had to bring out performances I hadn’t had time to really get into.” The soap world was stressful but formative, leaving Emmanuel with nothing but respect for their stars. “Anyone who says anything about soap stars can suck it as far as I’m concerned!” she says.When she left in 2010, Emmanuel’s career pretty much ground to a halt, leading to a stint on the shopfloor at preppy clothing chain Hollister. She can’t stand seeing other actors chided for having such “normal” jobs, as happened this year when the former Eastenders actor Katie Jarvis was ridiculed on social media for working as a security guard.“If you’re privileged enough to be born into a family who can financially support your creative dreams, that’s amazing,” she says. “But not everybody has that. And to shame people for wanting to support themselves – she’s just being a mum and a good one.”Emmanuel has a strong social conscience, praising her own mum (a carer for adults with learning disabilities) and her sister (a primary school teacher) for working to remedy “the day to day struggles of people”. A few days after our interview, she appears in a video for Operation Black Vote, alongside fellow actor Will Poulter and the journalist Ash Sarkar.All the time she was at Hollister, Emmanuel pressed her agent to put her forward for GoT, her favourite show. When the role of Missandei came up, she prepared extensively, learning the Valyrian language and mastering various accents. After five weeks, she found out she had got the part, bursting into tears on the phone. “I really loved Missandei’s journey,” she says rapturously. “In the grand scheme of the show, Missandei and Grey Worm didn’t have a lot of time, but we had some lovely scenes. I also loved my relationship with Emilia Clarke as Daenerys – that female friendship and respect for each other. It was such a joy to do.”Emmanuel’s brow furrows, however, as she guesses the next question. Missandei’s death angered many fans and critics when it aired in May. US culture site Vulture said Missandei “dies as a pawn rather than a person”. Director Ava DuVernay tweeted her dismay: “So ... the one and only sister on the whole epic, years-long series? That’s what you wanna do? Okay.” Writer Mikki Kendall added that Missandei “died in chains with no way to defend herself. Lyanna slays a giant. Missandei should have too.” Even before her death, Vanity Fair commented that the treatment of both her character and Grey Worm, played by Jacob Anderson, “reeks of years of aggregated missed opportunity”.Emmanuel says: “Obviously, Missandei’s demise sparked a big conversation.” Before then, she says, “the show was criticised for its lack of ersity. Jacob and I often had to answer for that, as the two prominent characters of colour in the show, which was really difficult.” She pauses, keen to emphasise the agency she felt Missandei had, and the triumph of her final war cry, before returning to the limitations of her death.“The reaction to Missandei’s death was so big because she was the only one. I think a lot of the people who felt othered or disenfranchised had connected with her, or felt represented by her, especially women of colour. When she died – and in the way that she did – it was so painful for people because they were like, ‘Wait, no! That’s how they’re going to do the only woman of colour?’”Emmanuel never thought she and Grey Worm would sail off into the sunset to Naath. “That’s not Game of Thrones.” But she does want other shows to learn from the situation – and not sentence her to yet more “overwhelming pressure” to constantly discuss ersity, or its absence.Thankfully, Four Weddings promises to be different, not least because Kaling, a woman of colour, is at the helm. Emmanuel plays Maya, a political speechwriter who travels from the US to London for her best friend’s birthday, soon discovering that – by coincidence – the handsome chap called Kash she bumped into at Heathrow is her friend’s boyfriend. He’s played by Nikesh Patel, star of Indian Summers. The romantic dilemma that ensues is one of many to unfold over 10 episodes.Romcoms, says Emmanuel, “have never been particularly welcoming of ersity. So the fact that we had Kash and Maya – a British Pakistani Muslim man and an African American woman – at the centre of the story is very rare. The fact that it was even on the table was a breath of fresh air.” She is pleased they have been able to revisit Curtis’s “quintessentially British” films in a fresh way. “The truth is that those films did not represent the London that we live in – and we got to do that.”Besides, Four Weddings has been a change from all the bloody struggles of Westeros. “It’s a lot of fun – it’s light, it’s not that serious. There are a lot of shows these days that are so dark and violent and we love their drama, but this is about millennials and their love lives. And no one gets their head cut off.”• Four Weddings and a Funeral airs on Starzplay in the UK from 12 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8efbc520ac10c584a8e8132ef569ea21c124a56/254_386_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabfd2ad2f02431aeca2460ccddf63e","title":"the country faces a bright future finland readers on their new pm","story":"We asked readers in Finland to share their thoughts on the country’s new prime minister.

Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, FinlandBest choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed ‘fresh air’. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

Lawmakers were debating late into the night on holding the vote on 2 March.Israel has been gripped by political paralysis for the best part of a year after two inconclusive votes gave neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor his rival, Benny Gantz, a clear lead.Both men have attempted to cobble together a 61-seat majority, while also stalling each other’s plays for power. A final 21-day period in which any parliamentarian could be nominated as prime minister also ended with no frontrunner.The development is seen as a boon for Netanyahu who had feared a last-minute deal by the opposition would end his decade-long run in power.However, under indictment in three substantial corruption cases and facing a small but vocal party mutiny, the leader of the right-wing Likud party immediately enters a new battle. The looming charges have weakened Israel’s longest-serving leader, and he will likely have to face a party leadership primary on 26 December.He is largely expected to win, although recent polling suggests his popularity may have taken a hit for the forthcoming national election.The political stalemate has played out during a fraught time for Israel. While politicians have bickered and traded blame, the country has fought on-off fights with militants in Gaza. Meanwhile, an increasingly open conflict heats up with Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy and a regional powerhouse.One option to end the domestic crisis was for the two main parties to join together in a unity government, as they would have more than enough support for a 61-seat majority. But there have been vast differences between the rivals during negotiations on key aspects such as how the next administration will look, including who leads it.Gantz ran his election campaign on the promise to topple Netanyahu, making it difficult for the opposition leader to accept a power-sharing deal without losing credibility.The prime minister has insisted his traditional allies from hardline nationalists to religious parties be included in any unity government, a precondition Gantz has rejected.Netanyahu was also reported to have demanded he serve first under any rotation agreement with Gantz, as he would want to remain in office as the court cases start rolling. If he retains the role of prime minister, he is not legally-obliged to step down from public office and could use his position to push for immunity. Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a “witch-hunt”.Fresh elections are expected to cost hundreds of millions of pounds and many fear bitter campaigns seen in the previous two rounds will further ide the country. Netanyahu was widely accused of racist scaremongering focused on Israel’s Arab minority to rally support.“Keep your children away from the television,” said Yair Lapid, a senior member of Blue and White, saying the campaign will be a “festival of hate, violence and disgust”.“What used to be a celebration of democracy has become a moment of shame for this building,” he added. “There are only three reasons for this election — bribery, fraud and breach of trust,” he said, referring to the criminal charges filed against Netanyahu.Netanyahu did not attend Wednesday night’s vote. In a video on social media, he accused Gantz of conspiring with Arab leaders and “forcing” new elections. “In order to prevent this happening again, there is only one thing we must do: win and win big,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad0a3843bd74bcdabe9056630c7aa28688867d0a/0_63_2927_1756/master/2927.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1a541a59048e3faf5a4aa5a3e3f2f37","title":"thursday briefing now for the only poll that counts","story":"Leaders rally supporters ahead of today’s vote … claim that Johnson ‘hid in fridge’ … and in non-election news, ‘peak meat’ climate deadline loomsby  Kate Lyons and  Warren MurrayWe made it.

Johnson’s final day was marred by accusations he hid in a fridge in order to avoid an interview with Good Morning Britain, which Marina Hyde called “the final frontier in election WTF-ery”.

The OPW will next year conduct a mobility study, which will consider potential for electric shuttles, a train train, Luas extension, cycling and car facilities."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4112538.1576097221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no major retail for phoenix park says opw commissioner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPW will press ahead with developing plans for the Ashtown centre, the Magazine Fort (above) and for the mobility study. File photograph: Aidan Crawley The Office of Public Works (OPW) has “no intention” of developing major retail or other commercial facilities in the Phoenix Park, OPW commissioner John McMahon has said.Mr McMahon was responding to public concerns that proposals in a strategic review of the park’s “visitor experience” would result in “overdevelopment” and “commercialisation” of Dublin’s “green lung”.More than 1,500 people made written submissions on the review with a further 4,511 signing a petition drafted by the Green Party. The most consistent view was that the park should be left largely untouched, with interventions kept to a minimum and retail facilities avoided.“Certain people will always be suspicious of our motivation. There is a view that the whole review is an attempt to bring in large retail to the park, I can assure you that nothing is further from the minds of the OPW and the Government,” Mr McMahon said.He said plans the OPW had for development in the park would be subject to the rigours of the planning process.“Even if I was the devil incarnate with horns, or some unscrupulous developer, everything we do is subject to the full planning process, but I can tell you that major retail is 100 per cent not going to happen.”Additional facilities However Mr McMahon said some additional facilities were needed in the park, particularly toilets.“There are approximately 10 toilets in the park for 10 million visitors a year. There are clear deficiencies in facilities. The Ashtown Demesne gets 1.9 million visitors a year, but the visitor centre was built 30 years ago when it got 25,000-30,000 a year and there are regularly queues out the door of the cafe.”Just under 20 per cent of submissions opposed the commercialisation of the park and particularly mentioned being against a “large visitor centre”, while 14 per cent were against any further retail and cafe development. The review said the OPW is considering a “very narrow focus” on the sale of artisan foods and crafts. It also said there must be “some increased capacity for parking” at the Ashtown centre. There were mixed views in relation to parking and car parks. While 14 per cent supported a reduction in car usage, and a similar number were against additional parking, in particular the proposal to make the temporary parking used for the Bloom festival permanent. Others suggested commuter routes needed to be maintained and more dedicated car parks for particular facilities needed to be built.Mobility study Many submissions sought better public transport options including electric shuttles, a possible train station or an extension of the Luas line. Due to the various views on transport the OPW will next year undertake a mobility study for the park.“This is a very important issue and I would like to think we would do this properly. Cycling is a big issue, as well as public transport and what we do with cars. If I was starting with a blank page, would I allow cars at all? But Chesterfield Avenue has evolved over decades as a commuter route and for many people it is a necessary way to get into and out of work,” Mr McMahon said. “Technology is moving so fast that we also need to consider the potential of driverless electrical vehicles.”Almost 10 per cent of respondents welcomed the plans for the refurbishment of the Magazine Fort as a military history visitor attraction, but considered a funicular running from the fort to the War Memorial Gardens excessive and “gimmicky”.“It was just an idea we have no plans for a a funicular railway, certainly not in the next decade.”The OPW will press ahead with developing plans for the Ashtown centre, the Magazine Fort and for the mobility study, he said. However people should be assured there will be no change to the character of the park, he said.“People want the park to stay as it is, and that is essentially what we are saying ourselves. The 2011 conservation management plan is our bible and any development will be measured and sensitive – there will be no big dramatic construction.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Social and affordable housing will be built using \u0026euro51 million AIB loanPassengers complain of 30 minute delays and packed trains after Adamstown incidentGarda\u0026iacute were called following the incident and a file is being prepared for coroner\u0026rsquos officePeople asked to conserve water as demand reaches record levels over Christmas periodConor McGregor and Maura Higgins the most popular Instagram accountsUAE firm breached UN arms embargo over decommissioned ship, Security Council toldUN Security Council traces ownership via UAE to Libya, contrary to sanctionsMore than 1,500 people made written submissions in response to strategic reviewPublic opposes retail elements in Dublin\u0026rsquos park but shuttles and train may materialiseOireachtas committee chairman sends requests as Deloitte defends \u0026lsquorobust\u0026rsquo auditingAreas of NRBU concern include Palmerstown, Sandymount, Clondalkin and TyrrelstownTeams of passionate volunteers are putting together an overview of how our birds are faringReport finds a third of drug poisoning deaths in 2017 involved alcoholTalking turkey: Safefood serves up advice for Christmas cooksGovernment criticised for failure to build enough refuges to meet demandTD told to \u0026lsquostop your nonsense and stick to the facts\u0026rsquoMary Robinson wanted to reassure young people \u0026lsquothey have made their voice heard\u0026rsquoMan arrested in Dublin released without chargeFormer employee says he has not worked since attempting to lift 20kg bag in 2014Alliance for Insurance Reform responding to paper by Law Reform Commission"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4112593.1576100408!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"regulators asked to investigate audits of fai accounts","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCommittee members raised concerns that they may not have a chance to question the outgoing president of the FAI, Donal Conway, if the association does not appear before it in advance of his finishing date in January. Photograph: Ryan ByrneInphoThe chairman of the Oireachtas sport committee has written to accountancy and auditing regulators asking them to investigate the audits of the Football Association of Ireland’s (FAI) accounts.Chairman Fergus O’Dowd took the step after the committee decided in private session on Wednesday that it did not have the remit to call the auditors of the association, Deloitte, before it.Mr O’Dowd told The  that he was taking the step due to the emergence of a €55 million liability in the accounts of the FAI, which was arrived at following a re-examination and restating of financial results for 2016 and 2017, and the publication of 2018 accounts.In a letter to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA), seen by The , Mr O’Dowd said he noted “with great concern” that recent surpluses had been dramatically reduced in restated accounts. In 2017, a surplus of €2.8 million had become a loss of €2.9 million. For 2018, the FAI made a loss of almost €9 million.“Can I ask that your authority, as the Irish Accounting Supervisory Authority, will investigate as a matter of urgency all aspects of these audits by Deloitte,” he wrote. A similar letter will be sent to the Chartered Accountants Regulatory Board (Carb).It came after the FAI declined an invitation to appear in front of the committee on Wednesday, despite first indicating that it would answer members’ questions about its finances. The committee is set to invite the FAI back in front of it next Wednesday, and if that date doesn’t suit, it will offer a standing invite to the organisation to appear whenever it can be arranged.Committee members raised concerns that they may not have a chance to question the outgoing president of the FAI, Donal Conway, if the association does not appear before it in advance of his finishing date in January.‘Answers’Noel Rock, the Fine Gael TD for Dublin North-West, said “it is quite clear the whole country, myself included, want answers. Mr Conway is in a position to answer them. The committee are prepared to meet the FAI at any time, day or night, to get those answers into the public domain.”Mr Conway served on the board of the FAI during almost the entire tenure of former chief executive John Delaney, and was on the board when his controversial pay deal, including generous loyalty and pension payments, was signed off. He said last week he was guilty of a “sin of omission” in relation to certain aspects of corporate governance failings by the board.Committee member Catherine Murphy said she believed all the directors who served on the board during Mr Delaney’s tenure should step down. “By virtue of the fact that some directors were part of the old board, it’s not giving the new directors a fair chance.”Elsewhere, a committee plan to simultaneously question the FAI and Minister for Sport Shane Ross next Wednesday has been abandoned after Mr Ross made it known that he would not be willing to appear before the committee at the same time as the association."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4112646.1576104400!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"weinstein reaches 25m settlement with more than 30 women report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe lack of personal accountability for  former movie producer Harveyn Weinstein has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved. Photograph: Justin LaneEPAMore than 30 women who were allegedly subjected to sexual misconduct by the disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein have reportedly reached a $25 million (€22 million) settlement which, if approved, would bring to an end most of the civil lawsuits pending against him. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a tentative deal had been agreed involving Weinstein’s numerous alleged victims in the US, Canada, Britain and Ireland. The proposal is awaiting final approval from the courts and from iniduals involved, the newspaper says, but once those last hurdles are cleared payouts would be made by insurance companies handling the bankruptcy of the Weinstein Company. Weinstein himself would not have to pay a penny to his accusers or have to admit wrongdoing under the terms of the settlement, the Times reports. The lack of personal accountability for the former movie producer has caused expressions of disappointment and anger from several of the women involved, though parties to the negotiations insist that the legal options open to them were limited. “I don’t love it, but I don’t know how to go after him. I don’t know what I can really do,” the actor Katherine Kendall, who was allegedly sexually harassed by Weinstein in 1993, told the paper. The pending settlement in the multiple civil lawsuits is by no means the end of Weinstein’s legal woes.Criminal charges On January 6th, his criminal trial is scheduled to open with jury selection in a Manhattan court. The criminal charges against him include the alleged rape of a woman in 2013 and an accusation of forced oral sex on a similarly unnamed woman in 2006. Weinstein has denied any claim of non-consensual sex, criminal or civil. In August Weinstein was also charged with two counts of predatory sexual assault to allow a third woman, the actor Annabella Sciorra, to testify about an alleged rape in 1993. Though the statute of limitations has passed in that incident, prosecutors hope her testimony will demonstrate a pattern of behaviour on the part of the defendant that will help secure his conviction. Weinstein has been free on bail since his arrest in May 2018. On Wednesday his bail conditions were raised from $1 million (€898,000) to $5 million (€4.4 million) after the prosecution accused him of tampering with his electronic ankle monitor. Lawyers for Weinstein, who arrived at court on Wednesday walking with the use of a frame, had claimed the irregular handling of the bracelet was innocently caused by “technical glitches”. The pending settlement in the civil lawsuits was revealed by Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, the two New York Times reporters who first broke the news of #MeToo sparkWeinstein’s long history of alleged sexual misconduct in October 2017, sparking the #MeToo movement. The reporters went on to be awarded a Pulitzer prize and to write a bestselling book on the subject, She Said. Aspects of the tentative deal will probably be contentious and have already prompted angry responses from some of Weinstein’s alleged victims. In particular, more than $12 million (€10 million) out of a total $47 million (€42 million) package to close the Weinstein Company’s affairs would feed back to Weinstein himself along with his brother, Bob, and other board members to contribute to legal costs. According to the Times, two women involved in civil suits against the former producer, Alexandra Canosa and Wedil David, have refused to join the settlement and are challenging it. In a statement, Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for David, said: “We reject the notion that this was the best settlement that could have been achieved on behalf of the victims. It is shameful that $12 million of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein.” He added: “We plan to vigorously object to any provision that tries to bind victims who want to proceed with holding Harvey Weinstein accountable for his actions which is exactly what we intend to do.” –  "},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election 2019 live: Result \u0026#39too close to call\u0026#39 as polls open - latest newsManifesto watch: the key policies from each party\u0026#39s 2019 election campaignWho should I vote for in the general election today?

They looked at a wide variety of different worlds, from relatively small mini-Neptunes only 10 times bigger than our Earth to super-Jupiters that are as big as 600 of our own planet, and from places that are between\u0026nbsp20C\u0026nbspand 2000C.They found that water was common across many of those exoplanets. But they also discovered that there was less of it on those planets than expected, and there was great variety between the different kinds of worlds.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberWe are seeing the first signs of chemical patterns in extra-terrestrial worlds, and we\u0027re seeing just how erse they can be in terms of their chemical compositions, said project leader Dr\u0026nbspNikku\u0026nbspMadhusudhan\u0026nbspfrom the Institute of Astronomy at Cambridge.In our solar system, there is much more carbon relative to hydrogen in the atmospheres of the giant planets than there is in the Sun. That is thought to have come about at the formation of the planets, when large amounts of ice and other particles were pulled into the planet.Scientists find which exoplanets could host alien lifeResearchers think that there will be a similar situation on other giant exoplanets. If that is true, there should also be large amounts of water.Using data from a huge array of different telescopes, both in space and on the ground, the researchers found that water vapour was present in 14 of th 19 planets, and that there was also an\u0026nbspabundance of sodium and potassium in six planets.But they also found that there was less oxygen relative to other elements, and that they might have formed without gathering significant amounts of ice.It is incredible to see such low water abundances in the atmospheres of a broad range of planets orbiting a variety of stars, said Dr Madhusudhan.The new data gives us a detailed understanding of exoplanets that we don\u0027t even have of our nearest neighbours, scientists said.Measuring the abundances of these chemicals in exoplanetary atmospheres is something extraordinary, considering that we have not been able to do the same for giant planets in our solar system yet, including Jupiter, our nearest gas giant neighbour, said Luis\u0026nbspWelbanks, lead author of the study and\u0026nbspPhD\u0026nbspstudent at the Institute of Astronomy.The discovery changes our understanding both of the prevalence of water on alien planets but also challenges our understanding of how those distant worlds might have formed.Given that water is a key ingredient to our notion of habitability on Earth, it is important to know how much water can be found in planetary systems beyond our own, said\u0026nbspproject leader Dr\u0026nbspMadhusudhan.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time.

It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, has also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up quickly and effectively.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further potential environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action to remove carbon from the

Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects and it is trialling methods that do not use solvents.Drax also needs more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created

warning about climate change to business figures gathered in Davos, telling them that what we do now...will profoundly affect the next few thousand years.Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world’s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change.38 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are meltingThe Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown.48 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industryGreater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry.58 Japan confirms plan to resume commercial whaling in its waters from next yearJapan will resume commercial whaling next year for the first time in more than three decades, in a move that has provoked strong criticism from campaigners and the international community.Diplomats from around the world have agreed a major climate deal after two weeks of United Nations talks in Poland.78 ‘Unprecedented changes’ needed to stop global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the total loss of every coral reef, the disappearance of Arctic ice and the destruction of island communities, a landmark UN report has concluded.88 Africa’s three biggest elephant poaching cartels exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues stark warning

should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action to remove carbon from the atmosphere needs to be done in addition to reducing emissions in transport and homes.”carbon capture and storage\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the

Capital and £60,000 from Davide Serra, whose firm has shares in a US fracking “pioneer”.“These are significant inidual donations, of up to half a million pounds, from hedge funds and financiers with tens of millions invested in businesses that are driving the climate emergency,” Mr Parr said.But a Tory spokesperson said: “The Conservative Party is funded by membership, fundraising and donations.\u0026nbspDonations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission, published by them, and comply fully with the law.“The Conservatives have reduced emissions by a quarter, part of the fastest reduction by any G20 nation, and boosted renewables to record levels.”In a statement, the Lib Dems pointed to commitments in their manifesto to require all UK-registered companies, and those listed on stock exchanges, to report on climate change targets “consistent with the Paris Agreement”.The party would also regulate financial services to encourage green investments and create new powers for regulators to act if banks and other investors are not managing climate risks properly.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner.

At the point the clip kicks in, Nish has already lost them and is, as always, playing the race card.Half the crowd are booing, the other half are begging him to say something funny, ashe might suddenly turn into Robin Williams.A great comedian could still have turned it round and adjusted their material, of course.But Nish Kumar is neither great nor even a comedian. He’s a left-wing propagandist who cannotoutside of the tiny BBC Channel  echo chamber, so he has to be ushered off stage by the tombola bloke in red livery.It could’ve happened to any one of a number of C BBC “comedians”, obviously. The Tez O’Clock Show, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order are all just as biased and unpleasant as The Mash Report.Nish is by far the smuggest offender, though, andthe BBC is ever going to make a mass audience laugh again, instead of just lecturing us, it needs to learn the Lord’s Taverners lesson and carve these words on a comedy gravestone: “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish Kumar.

A Boris victory would kill off that threat for ever.He would then be able to pour £billion extra into the NHS, hire , more cops to hammer crime, inject substantial new funding into schools and green-light multi-billion-pound, job-creating infrastructure projects.Plus, Boris will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT for five years.No sane politician can or should compete with the absurd freebies Corbyn claims he could dole out. Labour’s entire plan is a vast, ruinous fantasy, relying solely on the better-off sticking around to be hammered again and again for extra tax. The truth is everyone would pay for Marxist revolution.Boris, by contrast, would not bankrupt Britain. Nor wage war on private companies, as Corbyn would, and scare off investors, causing mass job losses.And, crucially, he tends to achieve what he sets out to. He ran for Mayor in Labour-dominated London and won twice. He led the Leave campaign to victory against the Remainer establishment. He was written off as a futureTory leader but won that too. He doggedly pursued, and won, the new Brexit deal every know-all said was impossible.Boris is being subjected to a tsunami of hate from Corbyn’s thugs and diehard Remainers who know he is Brexit’s last hope. Almost all of it is confected cobblers. Boris is as liberal as any of them.He is nothing like their hard-right caricature and they know it. Had he backed Remain they would love him.Boris is the right man to lead Britain into the s. And the alternative, as Corbyn’s own front-benchers privately admit, is too horric to think about.Vote Tory tomorrow.HEARING Corbyn branded a national security risk by one of his most senior frontbenchers is almost too much to grasp.Jon Ashworth, shadow health secretary, believes that his own leader is a danger to Britain. ThatCorbyn becomes PM on Friday the civil service will need to act rapidly to keep us all safe.The Sun has long considered Corbyn an unprecedented threat to our country. He is far closer to terrorists like Hamas than our No ally, America, which he detests. Our security partners would not trust him with classied information.But this taped confession tells us much about those around him too.In public Ashworth is a loyal Corbynista. In private he says Corbyn is a security threat and a loser who blocked Brexit. He longs to replace him with someone “half-decent”.He and his allies know their leader to be useless.

By not supporting Jeremy Corbyn and his Communist buddies, I am - I am told - an “age traitor”. Boris is for boomers, the thinking goes, and Corbyn is for us.But scratch the surface and you’ll find that the Prime Minister - a man who made his name as mayor of London - has rather a lot to offer us young folk. And Jeremy Corbyn - a Marxist straight from the s- might just make our lives a hell of a lot worse.Take, for example, the issue the vast majority of young people say matters to them most: housing.If you’re a young private renter, Corbyn’s radical plan to crackdown on “dodgy” landlords sounds really rather good.But there’s a serious catch. If landlords could be forced by the government to sell their homes to tenants at a price dictated by the Government, the buy-to-let market would collapse. And fast.In a few pockets of the country, where housing supply is plentul, that would be great. With landlords out of the picture, those desperate to get on the property ladder might stand a chance.In most of Britain, though, the picture wouldn’t be so rosy. Where available housing is precious and most people can’t afford to get on the housing ladderprivate renting is a blessing. And a collapse in the buy-to-let market would hike the price of it.So under Corbyn’s “fairer Britain”, those right at the start of their careers would soon be priced out of metropolitan areas.Then take university fees. Again, the idea of “free uni” sounds very tempting indeed. But under Corbyn’s regime, university tuition wouldn’t suddenly become free. It would just be paid for by the tax-payer instead of the student.What does that mean in practice  Well, it means that the  per cent of young people who opt to get a job end up at  would end up massively subsidising the  per cent who choose to enjoy three years of student le. I loved my time at uni, but I don’t see why my  year old cousin - who’s been working his socks off in the navy for three years - should be forced to pay for it.And evenyou are a student or planning to go to university, Corbyn won’t help you in any real sense. If students don’t contribute to their own education, universities suddenly have a lot less money. Which means they can’t admit as many teenagers.In Scotland, for example, where tuition has been “free” for years, fewer and fewer young people are going to university. And because the middle classes know how to game the system, it tends to be disadvantaged kids who get let down.Andyou work for yourself, which around % of Generation Z would like to do, Labour’s radical tax plan certainly isn’t for you.Even though Jeremy Corbyn has promised that only the richest five per cent of workers will face higher bills, new analysis shows that self-employed workers earning much less could be £, a year worse off under the new rules. And sole traders - ie. young, ambitious entrepreneurs who pay themselves lower salaries in order to invest in their businesses - would suffer the most.Boris Johnson might not be a hit at Glastonbury. But like a true One Nation Conservative, he believes in opportunity. And his pragmatic schemes, like % deposit mortgages, would give hard working young people a proper leg up in le.I don’t hunt, I don’t shoot, and I wouldn’t be seen dead in tweed. But I believe that a country can only succeed when ambitious young people are encouraged by the state to spread their wings and fly. Not given countless handouts by a bankrupt Government.So tomorrow, I’ll be voting Conservative with pride.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The stakes have never been this high.You can back Boris Johnson — who makes a direct plea to Sun readers — to secure Brexit by January  and steer us into a bright new decade as a prosperous and independent nation outside the EU.If you don’t, oryou stay at home, you risk handing power to Jeremy Corbyn’s extremists, who will reverse Brexit andus to the industrial carnage of the bleak s which his union paymasters consider a golden age.Back in  The Sun’s famous “lightbulb” front pagewarned of the nightmare of a Neil Kinnock Labour Government.That would have been a picnic compared with a Corbyn regime which threatens to drag our great country into a terrying and dark new era.Imagine you wake tomorrow to find Jeremy Corbyn, even in defeat, somehow cobbling together a Government in which the Scottish Nationalists and Lib Dems call the shots.Imagine this appalling Remainer pact drafting a new, rigged Brexit referendum and another hideously isive Scottish independence vote.Imagine them radically altering the voting rules to ensure hard-Left power for a generation.Imagine that the Pound has already crashed, hundreds of billions are being pulled out of the country and our global allies are making contingency plans to freeze out our new Marxist Prime Minister, considered a national security risk not just by them but by his own health secretary.This is not some scare story The Sun has invented. It is inevitableBoris Johnson has agonisingly too few seats for a working majority.As the economy begins its rapid descent into ruin, with the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs — maybe including yours — imagine how you will feelyou didn’t go out and vote to prevent it.The Sun has warned for years how dangerous Corbyn, his creepy shadow chancellor John McDonnell and their Communist aides are.We highlighted how they backed the IRA while it was executing our soldiers and civilians. How Corbyn considers Arab terrorists “friends” while loathing the West and our No ally America in particular.We told how his anti-Semitism had drawn Jew-hating bigots to his party like flies to a cesspit and led to Labour becoming only the second party after the fascist BNP to be probed for racism by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.We described how he and McDonnell revel in left-wing thuggery and foster a vicious hatred of opponents, exemplied by their repulsive social media trolls and the flashmobs that publicly vily and intimidate Tories.They have created a party of hypocrites and liars for whom no fabrication is too bigit damages the Tories they detest. A party which built an election campaign around a monstrous hood about the Tories “selling the NHS” to Trump.Corbyn was a joke once. Now, with this election as tight as it is, he is on the brink of power. It should terry every sane person in Britain. It is shocking that it does not. It is profoundly depressing to see people supposedly opposed to racism give Labour’s anti-Semitism a free pass asit is a “lesser” prejudice, even a socially acceptable one. Tell that to terried British Jews, resigned to emigrating to escape Corbyn. Or to the  former Labour MPs who yesterday begged the public not to vote for their old boss for precisely this reason.What has our country become that such a toxic, dangerous party could be within a mile of power  A party which derives its energy from grievance and hate  What has happened to our education system that the insane high-tax, business-destroying economics of Corbyn and McDonnell, which have brought ruin everywhere they have been applied, are discussed as a serious possibility  That despite mass starvation in Venezuela, which Corbyn held up as his model, his young fans still believe the same system is worth a go The answer is austerity and its successful weaponisation by a Labour Party relying on voters forgetting why it was necessary. Well, here’s a reminder: In  the global financial crisis and Labour’s scandalous over-spending left us heading for bankruptcy. Labour was borrowing nearly £billion a WEEK and left incoming Tories a snarky note: “Dear Chief Secretary. I’m afraid there is no money.”They thought it was FUNNY. The cost was nine long years of cuts, vital to get our finances back in order. These are now presented as a cruel Tory “choice”. That is nonsense. They had no alternative.But, yes, public services have struggled. The NHS is short-staffed and cannot keep pace with an older, sicker and rapidly expanding population. Police cuts have hurt the fight against crime.Homes are far too expensive for young people, particularly in the South. Many of those don’t recall Labour’s financial disaster. They just want change and an economic stake in society. But they and too many others who will vote Labour because they are sick of “Tory cuts” forget why they happened:Labour wrecked the economy. The Tories had to fix it.Boris is a dferent Tory, unafraid to spend big to pump le back into “left-behind” communities.His economic programme is far more lavish than that of Theresa May or David Cameron. He will plough billions more into the NHS, police, schools and new infrastructure projects. He has a zeal to regenerate regions that fell behind as London flourished. Mrs May talked about it. Boris will do it.And, yes, a Tory majority WILL deliver Brexit on January . But you are going to have to vote for it.Too many think they voted for Brexit once, it didn’t happen and they can’t be bothered voting any more. That all politicians are liars, so why trust any  Or that Nigel Farage has promised to deliver Brexit too, so you’ll vote for him.These would be disastrous errors.Farage’s party will not win seats. A vote for his Brexit Party is one lost to the Tories, as several Farage candidates have now admitted.Andyou’re a Remainer Tory who dislikes Boris, a vote for the Lib-Dems is not a “free hit”. It’s a vote for chaos, from which Corbyn is almost certain to emerge as PM.The stark reality is Britain cannot afford for Boris to fall short.Soyou are inclined to vote Tory you MUST go out today and do it.Boris has been in power only four months, hamstrung all along by a Remainer Parliament. He could be a great PM and deserves a chance.Go out and vote Tory today. Save Brexit, and save Britain from Corbyn.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The choice facing you, the people of this country, tomorrow is truly historic.“The establishment doesn’t want Labour to win.” He added: “Tomorrow you can shock the establishment by voting for hope.Hope for yourself. Hope for your family. Hope for your community. Hope for our NHS. Hope for our country.”Mr Corbyn jubilantly declared “Labour is going to win the election” as he warned Boris Johnson to “look out”.On a -minute visit to Glasgow, Mr Corbyn blanked media amid a storm over his health spokesman Jonathan Ashworth trashing Labour’s chances in a leaked phone call. Instead Mr Corbyn declared class war on the wealthy.Slamming the Tories, he said: “Their’s is the party of billionaires, ours is the party of the many.“Tomorrow you can vote for despair and vote for the dishonesty of this government, or you can vote Labour and get a government that can bring hope to the future.”He then zipped down to Middlesbrough where shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald led the audience of around  Labour supporters in a festive singalong.The Corbynista frontbencher sang: “It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas, Johnson needs to go.“He’ll have to leave Number Ten, it’s time to get Labour in, they made a mess the Tories need to go.“It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas lots of ho ho ho. But the prettiest sight to see, will be Jeremy by the tree by No’s front door.”Labour’s party chairman Ian Lavery also boasted about their chances. Leaping to the stage, he yelled: “It’s within our grasp — we are only inches away from the winning line.”Brandishing the little red book containing their manesto, he said Labour will “transform society”.But Mr Corbyn had to pull out of two planned stops in Ashfield and Broxtowe as he ran out of time.New evidence of the cost of a Corbyn government emerged. Tory research discovered that Labour’s economic plans could send the cost of an average Christmas rocketing by a third.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell would like to implement a tax on food based on the number of air miles travelled. The nation’s favourite roast potatoes – maris pipers grown in Israel – would cost an extra p.A frozen stuffed Iceland Perfect Turkey Crown would cost another £. — as they come from Hungary. Sprouts, jetted in from South Africa, would cost £. extra.Christmas day costs the average family £ — butCorbyn wins, this could jump up another £.Meanwhile, Labour’s shadow treasury minister Clive Lewis has called for the government to give up trying to make Britain’s economy bigger.Mr Lewis has penned a chapter in Extinction Rebellion handbook This is not a Drill calling for ministers to “abandon the fetish of growth”. He is one of John McDonnell’s key deputies and would help run the economyLabour win.Tory ministers warned a Corbyn government would cost jobs, drive down wages, and ruin the economy.Treasury Minister Rishi Sunak said: “Don’t wake up on Friday the th to the nightmare of a Corbyn Sturgeon coalition.Corbyn’s plans wouldn’t just make your Christmas expensive, it would cost you an extra £, in taxes every year.”Treasury Minister Simon Clarke warned: “Corbyn’s Labour would wreck the economy and leave the country unable to pay for anything.”Last night Mr Corbyn prematurely declared victory in the social media election war.Labour said their videos notched up .million views on Facebook compared with m for the Tories.Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell need to “hear first hand about the impact of terror on families”, the group said.It added Mr Corbyn was “not just a sympathiser of the IRA but a supporter”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Each of the cats has its own, very inidual personality, and so each species of cat provided new challenges or experiences.”"},{"url":null,"title":"election jeremy corbyn nightmare rod liddle","story":"I dream I’ve just woken up and I look at the clock. It says “Friday th”. Then I hear a horrible cackling — and, OMG, it’s Diane Abbott standing by my bed, her face split open with mirth.“We’re in charge now!” she shrieks: “Ha ha ha ha ha.” And then the rest of the ghouls appear.Magic Grandpa Jeremy Corbyn, smirking through his beard, wearing his Lenin hat. Jo Swinson of the Lib Dems like a Girl Guide Leader from Hades. And then — grinning like Janette Krankie on acid — Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP.I try to hide under the covers but Diane pulls them back. “We’re in charge now,” she repeats. “And first we’re going to wreck Brexit. And then we’re going to wreck the country. Ha ha ha ha.”Friday, December  is the day we find out who will be ruling us for the next five years. And my nightmare could quite possibly come true.I’ve been saying for ages that the idiotic Corbyn could win this election — without actually winning any more seats.It is an incredibly precarious position for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives — and thus for Brexit.The polls seem to be tightening. The Conservatives haven’t run a terribly good campaign, it’s true.All it needs is another drop in the Tory lead of one per cent and we would be heading for a hung Parliament.That almost certainly means a government led by Corbyn, with support from the Lib Dems and the SNP. It would definitely mean an end for Brexit.The democratic decision we took three years ago would be forgotten. At best there would be ANOTHER referendum.Almost certainly rigged by Labour and the Lib Dems to ensure that, this time, the right side won, ie, their side.They have no respect whatsoever for that democratic mandate. They are very clear about that. But there will be even worse to come.Labour will usher in a ruinous economic programme which the country cannot possibly afford.Our entrepreneurs will flee the country. We’ll be back in huge debt once again. Spending on stuff we cannot afford.Labour plans to spend TWENTY EIGHT times as much money as the ConservativesWorst of all, we will be led by a halfwit who supports every enemy known to this country.You name a terrorist cell or a vile, authoritarian country and mad old Jezza will at some point have offered it support.From the IRA to the genocidal Islamists Hamas, from Cuba to Iran.The brilliant website Guido Fawkes has detailed all the times Corbyn has stuck up for terrorists or horrible totalitarian governments. Gawd help us, the list is almost endless.This is a bloke who has said he wishes Nato didn’t exist. That’s the military alliance which has kept peace for  years!But don’t take my word for it. Just this week yet another Labour MP was caught moaning about how truly bloody awful Corbyn was.Jonathan Ashworth said voters were turned off by the man and that the prospects for Labour were “dire”.He added: “I’m helping colleagues, banging on about the NHS for them, but it’s awful for them, and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit . . . outside of the city seats . . . it’s abysmal out there . . . they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.”That’s not “Tory lies”, as the lefties always say when someone takes a pop at the old scrote.That’s a member of his own front-bench team. But then a good two thirds of Labour MPs can’t stand Corbyn and think he would be awful for this country.As Boris Johnson said, Ashworth was only saying what hundreds of Labour candidates and millions of voters were thinking.You wonder why some of those candidates don’t have the courage of their convictions and stand down.In fact, plenty have already done so. Ivan Lewis, for example, who has urged everybody to vote Conservative.Then there was John Woodcock and Ian Austin. Both former Labour MPs, moderates. They even made placards telling people to vote Tory.More MPs left Labour long ago — such as Chuka Umunna, who is now standing as a Liberal Democrat, and Brexiteer Kate Hoey can’t bring herself to support the party she served for  years.The man and his retinue of Trots — John McDonnell, Rebecca Long-Bailey , the ghastly Diane Abbott — are a laughing stock. Except I don’t find very much to laugh about, to tell you the truth.And along with Labour and the Lib Dems will come more stupid, socially isive identity politics. The whole country ided up into competing victimhoods.Gay, transgender, black, Asian. Asthese were the things which define us as human beings.But then that’s the infantile and damaging way the Left sees the world.Given all this, you might think it incredible that Corbyn could ever get the keys to No Downing Street. So many people despise the bloke.And that’s before we factor in his repellent anti-Semitism .And you might look at the polls and think — well, the Tories still have a decent lead. Nothing much to worry about.It won’t be Friday th or Nightmare On Abbott Street. It might well be Groundhog Day, but that’s preferable. But this is the big problem for BoJo and his Conservative team. Complacency. The suspicion on the part of the electorate that Corbyn could never actually win. When he could win all too easily — and don’t forget, the opinion polls are very often wrong.The other problem for the Tories is, of course, the Brexit Party. They are still fielding candidates in seats up and down the country — seats which the Tories need to win in order to form a government.Some senior figures in the Brexit Party have already said they would be far better off backing the Tories in order to get Brexit done.But Brexit Party boss Nigel Farage will not listen to them.So we have the terrible situation where people might vote for the Brexit Party in order to make sure we leave the European Union — but in doing so actually STOP Brexit from occurring.Becausethe Brexit Party takes lots of votes from the Tories, that lets in Labour and the Lib Dems through the back door. And the result  No Brexit.It’s in those seats in the North and Midlands where the Conservatives are most vulnerable to a high Brexit Party vote.This is a crucial election. Not just for Brexit, but for Britain’s future.That means a vote for the Conservatives, no matter how much that sticks in the craw.I’ve mentioned before that the only time I voted Tory I felt pretty glum afterwards.But this time there really is no alternative except in a tiny handful of seats where the Tories cannot possibly win.Once this election is out of the way, we need a new party to provide opposition to the Tories.A party that will replace Labour. For me, that’s the Social Democrats. But we’re not at that stage yet.For now it’s a case of walking to the polling booth, holding your nose and voting Blue.You decide our government. You may have your doubts about our democracy — I don’t blame you! You may feel uneasy voting Tory — don’t blame you for that, either.But you hold the destiny of our country in your hands.Indeed, when you put that cross in a box, you ARE the government. The person who decides what is best for our country.So make your vote count, please — and banish those nightmares for ever. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Election officials in my district agreed.While Andrew Cleary posted a picture of hundreds of voters queuing up in Balham.The third General Election in less than five years has been largely dominated by the  vote to leave the European Union - with Labour pledging to give voters another say in a second referendum, while the Tories have vowed to take the UK out of the EU next month.In a final plea to voters on the eve of polling day, Mr Johnson warned that the election remained on a kne edge, but said it represented a chance to end the gridlock.Today is our chance to unite as a country and put the uncertainty to bed so people can get on with their lives, he told supporters in east London.Just imagine how wonderful it will be to settle down to a turkey dinner this Christmas with Brexit decided - and how awful it would beCorbyn and Sturgeon were in Downing Street advancing their plans for two more referendums.Lets stop the chaos and stop the referendums. We can secure a majority Conservative governmentwe win just nine more seats.A poll by The Dailyand Savanta ComRes, published last night, placed the Tories five points ahead of Mr Corbyns party - indicating the potential for a Conservative majority or a hung parliament.But a separate poll by Kantar put the Tories on %, Labour on % and the Liberal Democrats on %.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who gambled his premiership by triggering the vote, has sought to focus on his pledge to get Brexit done throughout the campaign.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, his rival in the race to Number , has instead tried to highlight his partys credentials on the health service and other domestic issues.Mr Johnson arrived at Central Methodist Hall in Westminster at around .am to cast his vote, bringing dog Dilyn along with him. Mr Corbyn is expected to vote in Islington later on Wednesday morning.The polls have narrowed in the final week of what has largely been a tame campaign - with few gaffes and many stage-managed visits.On Monday Mr Johnson came under fire for his alleged lack of empathy when he pocketed a journalists phone when asked to view a photograph of a four-year-old boy who was forced to sleep on a hospital floor.The following day, however, Labours campaign was rocked when a member of the shadow cabinet was revealed to have poured scorn on Mr Corbyns election chances in a leaked recording.A terror attack on London Bridge - which echoed a similar incident in the middle of the  election - briefly disrupted the campaign, but quickly turned political as the Tories and Labour exchanged blows over how to deal with such threats.Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, stressed the very profound issues at stake in Thursdays vote.Were literally at a fork in the road, he told the party faithful at a rally in north east London.So when the election comes tomorrow it is a very clear choice. You go down the road of Boris Johnson, a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump, we break off any serious relationship with Europe.Or you go down the Labour way, which is the adult, responsible way, of negotiating a settlement which we will all live by, and I will make sure is carried out in a future relationship with Europe.But we also go down the road of investing in our country, investing to end austerity and redistributing wealth and power in our society in a way thats never been seen before.Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson said the polls showed it was still absolutely possible to deny the Tories an overall majority through tactical voting.We know from past elections that, very often, voters who vote tactically come to that conclusion in the final hours before they cast their vote, she said.Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, speaking in Doncaster, said he was hoping for very, very heavy rain in the town on Thursday, in the belief that it would depress the votes of the other parties.I know that people who are going to vote for us will turn out, because they absolutely believe in our message, they believe in their hearts as well as in their heads, he said.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every vote for Labour brings the Corbyn revolution a step closer.That catastrophe could easily happen this week.In recent opinion polls, the Tories have maintained a consistent lead over Labour by about  per cent - enough for a comfortable majority.But in some surveys, the gap has fallen to just  points, while one poll at the weekend suggested a Conservative majority of just .Moreover, as the last two General Elections proved, the polls can be badly wrong. The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So the question is posed - can we vote with pens instead  And it turns out thereaposs a very simple answer to this question. Yes, you can vote with a penyouaposd prefer to do that. This is according to the Electoral Commission, who recently shared a guide to everything you need to know about voting.They said: Pencils are generally used to mark ballot papers for practical reasons: ink may dry or spill, or could smudge and transfer when the ballot paper is folded, which could lead to your ballot paper being rejected. But this is not mandatory - you can use your own penyou prefer. So there you have it folks, there are no sinister reasons as to why pencils are often provided at the polls, itaposs purely for practicality. This discovery has caused many social media users to proclaim they will be taking pens with them to vote as they donapost trust pencils. One person tweeted: Polling Stations - Pencils or Pens  As I recall, polling stations leave out pencils for the filling out of voting slips. I think Iaposll take a PEN with me as pencil lends itself to alteration. This hasnapost occurred to me before but this election gives me zero trust in our systems. Another said: Election week.

A Labour government that will provide the urgent funding needed to save our NHS and our schools, to establish free personal social care and childcare, and to end homelessness. A Labour future that will mean a pay rise for  million through a % increase for public sector workers and a Real Living Wage of £ an hour. It’s time to invest in our country and guarantee free education – with an end to zero hours contracts and secure jobs for all. The powerful billionaires, tax dodgers and bad bosses are desperate to prevent real change because the system is rigged in their favour. In this election campaign we’ve seen how far they’ll go. We’ve caught the Tories red-handed trying to sell our NHS to Trump. And we’ve all seen Boris Johnson promoting endless lies about his disastrous Brexit deal. After nine years of failure, you can’t trust the Conservatives to deliver anything. We will bring our country together and we will give you the final say, getting Brexit sorted. To stop the climate emergency we must act now. Labour’s plan for a Green Industrial Revolution will put British industry back on the map.

And , are newcomers to Labour ’s social media presence – which the party claims shows Labour has been able to reach out beyond its core base. “Labour have changed up their approach this election, they are far more combative and have energised a dference segment of the electorate to say  or even ,” said Tristan Hotham, a social media researcher at the University of Bath, who has studied the parties’ social media campaigning. Labour sources claim it has been a successful digital campaign for the party this year: Labouraposs eight-strong digital team has five times the number of video views on Twitter , and % more shares of content on Facebook , than it did in the  election. The most popular video the Labour Party has produced was Rob Delaney’s impassioned plea for the National Health Service , which has been seen by . million people.  Part of that popularity was driven by paid promotion of the video, says Hotham. He estimates the party spent up to £, promoting the American actor’s video on Facebook so it was seen . million times. “They have been kickstarting what more naturally occurred in ,” said Hotham, who estimates that the party has doubled spending on Facebook ad campaigns compared to . Who Targets Me, which has been tracking social media posts during the election campaign, has tracked the amount each party has to spend per impression for their online adverts on Facebook.  Labour and Jeremy Corbyn have  paid twice the amount  other major political pages to promote their adverts in the last month.   This comes as  New Scientist reported  that political campaigns in the United States have to pay up to three times as much to promote adverts on Facebook to people with opposing viewpoints. In all, videos on Jeremy Corbyn’s personal Facebook page have been seen nearly  million times – more than the  million views recorded in the longer  general election campaign. The Labour leader’s Facebook page is four times most influential than his party’s official Facebook presence, which has posted videos seen  million times and shared , times. “The fact that on an old stalwart like Facebook, that Labour can pull in new audiences shows a marked sht in the politics of the Facebook audience,” said Hotham. Hotham did point out that interactions includes comments and interactions, which can be negative as well as positive. While the party leaders criss-crossed the country in the final day of campaigning before polling stations open, the battle was being waged on social media.  Labour’s official Facebook page has earned more than half of the interactions across all political party pages on Wednesday, while the Tories have driven a third of all interactions. But on Instagram , the Conservatives were in the lead, with  percent of interactions the day before the election – twice the number that Labour had.

The Labour leader insisted only his party would keep the NHS from the clutches of profit-hungry US private firms, tackle poverty and reduce the growing inequality sweeping the country. As he spoke, EU chief Michel Barnier ­shattered Boris Johnson’s boast that he will “get Brexit done” next year by warning trade ­negotiations could take longer. And a new poll showed Labour had closed the gap on the Tories to just %, the smallest since October. Mr Corbyn said: “There’s a choice tomorrow. Either we continue with austerity and the horrible levels of poverty and security that many people face or you have a ­government that is serious about investing in the future.” And he added at a meeting in Hoxton, East London: “The choice facing you, the people of this country, tomorrow is truly historic. “The establishment doesn’t want Labour to win. They don’t want a Labour government on the side of the people, shaking up how this country is run. “Boris Johnson will open our NHS to takeover by American mega ­corporations and carry on with more cuts. That’s why Donald Trump wants Boris Johnson to win. Tomorrow you can shock the establishment, by voting for hope. “Hope for yourself. For your family. For your community. For our NHS. For our country. When Labour wins, the nurse wins, the pensioner wins, the student wins, the office worker wins, the ­engineer wins. We all win.” Mr Corbyn called on activists to spend today convincing undecided voters to back Labour, after an ugly ­election campaign marred by disgraceful smears on his character and a string of blatant lies and empty promises by Mr Johnson. He also had a dig at the PM for repeatedly ducking questions – and his latest bid to avoid scrutiny by hiding in a fridge on a milk round. Mr Corbyn, who embarked on a -mile trip speaking to crowds around the land, told a Middlesbrough meeting: “I’ve not come here to deliver milk, or to hide in a fridge. “I’ve come here with a message of hope. I am determined we go flat out, to get everyone to vote, and hopefully vote Labour and ­recognise in our manesto there is hope, there is something positive. “It is our chance tomorrow to elect a government that will be for the many not the few.”  He later added: “We now have had  days of this campaign and  days of unbelievable levels of abuse hurled at leading figures of the Labour Party. Unbelievable levels of character assassinations and I simply say this,you wish to inhabit the gutter, that’s fine by me but I will not be joining you there. We’ve had six weeks in which we’ve been campaigning all over the country six weeks in which we’ve been under relentless media assault against my party, ­nevertheless our message has got through. A message that we will protect the NHS we won’t do secret deals with the United States.” Labour Party chair Ian Lavery urged undecided voters to ask themselves “which side are you on”  He told activists: “When you knock on people’s doors when they say they don’t know ask them are they prepared to see people in the foreseeable future kids in poverty. “Kids going to school with holes in their shoes, kids going to school without the right attire in these freezing cold conditions, not even having food in their bellies, .million kids in poverty  We cannot allow this to continue.” Mr Corbyn started his day in Glasgow, travelled to the North East then went to Rother Valley and Bedford before a final rally in London.  A new Savanta ComRes poll for Thenewspaper showed the Tories unchanged on % but Labour up three percentage points to %. It came after a previous poll had predicted Mr Johnson was on track to win a -seat majority. Mr ­Johnson’s boast about forging trade deals with the EU by the end of next year were blown apart by Mr Barnier last night. In a leaked recording, the EU’s chief negotiator told a private meeting the -month timetable is “unrealistic”.

Vote Labour to keep alive the vision of Denis Healey, Barbara Castle and Harold Wilson for a better society. Generations of working people in Lancashire, Yorkshire and the North-East fought to sustain that dream and turn it into reality. Equality for women, massive council house building and increased social security. We supported New Labour, enabling Gordon Brown to pursue the goal, investing hugely in hospitals, schools, pensions and a surer start for kids. Let’s not abandon that loyalty now, when it’s needed most to save the NHS and alleviate hardship among the working poor, pensioners and children. Believe me, there are more important things in le than Brexit, when it might happen or evenit might happen. Like, how we live and who we trust to govern the country. And by those counts, this gang of lying, scheming Tories, the off-scourings of Eton and the City, have no claim on our votes. Remember , the Thatcher years when our gas, water and electricity were sold off to speculators, mostly foreign. Remember, the lads throwing themselves off the Tyne Bridge because they couldn’t find work. Remember the hundreds of thousands of miners, engineers, shipyard workers and utility employees who lost their jobs in the  wasted years of Thatcher’s reign. And the equally huge numbers of teachers, nurses, town hall staff, prison officers, youth and social workers and probation officers made redundant in the nine wasted years of Cameron, May and now Johnson governments. Tory rule has made Britain an unhappier place to live. Homelessness is on the increase, rough sleeping is out of control. Fewer and fewer people have a secure job, as the so-called “gig economy” booms, while the super-rich hide their wealth in tax havens overseas.

Fit and well, it came as a huge shock. Not least to his family and fiancee Kayleigh with whom he’d only recently welcomed new baby son Owen. But determined not to let the condition change his le, Dom carried on working as a customer service manager at TSB in Sunderland to support his family, even while having a form of chemotherapy. Dom spent weeks in hospital being treated with Lemtrada, which works to reset the immune system. He had two courses of the treatment,  months apart,  which aims to reduce the number of relapses by about %. Thankfully the treatment, at the Sunderland Royal Hospital, was a success.  “After the second treatment, I felt my le turn around and I had a renewed vigour and energy,” says Dom, now , and a Customer Service Team Manager at the Sunderland Contact Centre.“Mentally the whole has process has been tough as I didn’t know anything about the condition.” Determined to help others like him, the now father-of-two wants to give back. This September he ran the North Run, asking people to sponsor him so he could raise funds for the Multiple Sclerosis Society. He gave himself the apt name ‘MS Warrior’ and raised over £,.“I also created an Instagram page to try and inspire and motivate others who had the condition. I wanted to show them to keep up hope and that they could carry on with their lives.“Within weeks I had hundreds of new followers. I think my message must have got through. I just wanted to show people that le doesn’t have to end just because you have this diagnosis.” Now his courage is being recognised after he was first nominated and went on to win a Pride of TSB Award. Jacqui Wilkinson, a senior manager at TSB Sunderland, said: “Even having two years worth of chemo didnapost stop Dom working or being a vital part of our migration team by re-writing training support packs while he was in hospital. “He is an inspiration to all who meet him in and outside of work. His close work with our local Hospital and MS charity has changed his le and made him feel le is for living.” And Dom said: “I thought this was the perfect opportunity to raise awareness about Multiple sclerosis which is an unpredictable and incurable condition that affects peopleaposs nervous systems. “I feel the Multiple Sclerosis Society can contribute to make people’s le a little more comfortable and continue to work on finding a cure. I also feel it is really important to raise awareness as it’s a relatively unknown condition - so people who have been newly diagnosed don’t know what they are facing.  Thankfully I have received many dferent treatments to keep the condition under control.” Dom, who is now planning further feats including the London Landmarks half-marathon in March, added: “I want to give something back as I am currently feeling the best I have felt since my diagnosis.

Juliet Blaxland, , told the Mirror in September that she believed her home, one the furthest east in the UK, would be safe for at least five years. But violent autumn storms, alongside big tides, triggered a dramatic increase in erosion, with nine metres of land lost in the past four months. After the .-metre section fell away overnight in a “cataclysmic event” last week, engineers found the row of three cottages was now  metres from the clf and unsafe. Juliet and husband Giles Stibbe, , will move home next week. Juliet said: “We knew all along it would eventually be demolished but it has caught us by surprise, as we could have reasonably expected another year here. “But ever since we moved in we were always aware of how little time we had left.  “Demolition is incredibly sad. It’s the end of an era.” She said that the house is a “landmark” in Easton Bavents, East Suffolk. The village, north of Southwold, used to have a church, a thriving market and many houses. But unrelenting erosion has virtually des­­troyed the community. Juliet and Army veteran Giles moved into the ham­­let  years ago, renting from the local farmer. Since then they have seen the demolition of several houses and the disappearance of the land between them and the sea. And engineers have now told the farm owner that all cottage tenants should leave. Demolition crews are expected to raze the homes over Christmas.  Architect Juliet and Giles are moving up the coast to the village of Benacre. The area suffers from erosion, too, but their new home is far enough inland to be safe... for now. Coastal Partnership East, a group formed by several local councils, has been monitoring the situation.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA housing estate dubbed Scotlandaposs Chernobyl is set to be demolished next year. The Clune Park estate, in Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, is now home to about  people living in only some of the  flats.Property on the estate was once the cheapest in the UK, with one flat selling for just £, at auction, the Daily Record reports.The area however has been plagued with arsonists, causing shops, a primary school and a church to be abandoned. Plans to demolish the blocks created tensions between the council and private landlords who were refusing to sell up. The leader of Inverclyde Council, Stephen McCabe, previously said: It is a decimated, isolated community. It is a blight on the landscape. It is one of first things you see coming into Port Glasgow on the train. It would remind you of somewhere like Chernobyl. It is hoped next year bulldozers could move in to demolish the estate. We are progressing our strategy of acquiring all the properties to demolish them and we are progressing closing orders, Mr McCabe said.It has been a long haul to get here. We are continuing to engage with people who have properties in the area and we are trying to reach agreements with them in terms of acquiring the properties. Officers are hopeful that some time next year, we may well have sufficient properties that we can start to demolish in terms of at least one of the blocks.  Things are moving forward. I can see the end game. Some of the flats on the estate, which in the early part of the th century was home to shipyard workers, are in such poor condition that they pose a health risk.  Councillor Michael McCormick, Convener of Inverclyde Councilaposs Environment and Regeneration Committee, said: In the councilaposs opinion all of the flats on the estate are Below the Tolerable Standard- they donapost meet the basic requirements to be classed as fit for people to live in. And the results of several, recent, independent surveys have done nothing to change this view. The poor physical and social conditions in the area, combined with the level of input required from Police Scotland, Scottish Fire and Rescue and Inverclyde Council, clearly shows that the private housing market has failed and that large-scale, planned intervention is urgently needed.  Six buildings now have active Demolition Orders against them. The council is working towards demolishing all the buildings and clearing the site to allow this neglected part of Port Glasgow to be regenerated. A decade ago it was estimated that it would cost £.million to refurbish these buildings.  They have deteriorated even more since then. We are making steady progress in terms of acquiring these undesirable properties. But the remaining owners need to recognise that the only future for these homes is demolition and, frankly, the sooner the better. Mr McCabe added: We will continue to work and engage with the Scottish Government and call for them to support us with our strategy in terms of acquiring properties and potentially provide some funding for new a new build development on the site.

I couldn’t control my emotions – I would be almost manic one moment, then feeling weepy and irritable the next, she said. “Mum said I was like a toddler having tantrums. It was asall the normal ups and downs that everyone experiences were magnied ten times over.” Shortly after starting a degree in forensic investigations at Coventry University Beth was given the devastating diagnosis that she had a very rare tumour called paraganglioma. Surgeons at Birminghamaposs Queen Elizabeth Hospital also found two benign cysts in her lymph nodes and a malignant tumour in her liver in a March  operation. “Luckily the cysts in the lymph nodes had contained the malignant tumour and stopped it spreading further, Beth added.  “I was in intensive care for six days and it took me a few months to recover as it was such a big operation – I had been cut open from my chest to my belly – but I was determined to get back on my feet again and get back to university.” Bethaposs mum, Claire Ingram, praised her daughter for being strong during her treatment and for continuing her studies.

Zoeaposs boyfriend Robbie Gove posted about the fretful experience on Facebook , explaining how she was told she was going to be dealing with a Christmas party upstairs, but what she wasnapost told was that by that they meant the entirety of upstairsall by herself. Zoe said: I had two tables of , two tables of , plus other tables in there and the idea was I was going to collect the orders and the other guy that was meant to be with me was going to run drinks up and down the stairs and run food as well. I only had to greet people, take their drinks orders then sort out their payments at the end. He went downstairs to go fetch the drinks and that was the last I pretty much saw of him. Zoe felt increasingly under pressure and says the customers began to get irate about the wait. The thing that broke me was so ridiculous, explained Zoe. A woman asked me for ketchup and I realised I didnapost have any ketchup upstairs so I went downstairs to get some and went out the back and bawled my eyes out by the bins.  I had people coming at me from all sides asking where their food and drinks were. After she broke down Zoe says she struggled to regain a grip on her emotions, even shedding a tear in front of customers as she raced back to work. One table of customers had enough with the situation and walked out without paying, Zoe said. A table walked out, understandably, said Zoe, and I went home and I cried to my mum in the car and I got home and cried to Robbie and my friends that were at the house. Later that evening Zoe received a text from one of her managers.  She said: I received the text message at half past midnight telling me not to come to my sht the next day, that we donapost want a repeat of today and Iaposd have to come in for a meeting with the assistant manager on Monday at pm. Thataposs when I completely broke down with aposOh my god, this is badapos.

She described how the assistant manager slid a letter across the table, sheepishly I might add, and he let me read it.

The distraught youngster has now opened up about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her parent and his sick pals. The girl, from southern India, who can not be named for legal reasons, was gang-raped every weekend for two years by up to  men, counsellors believe. It is the latest horric story to shock the country whose authorities have been urged to do more to protect the innocent from vile sex attacks. It is understood the father, whose name also can not be revealed to protect the identity of the victim, would call men and take bookings for time with his daughter. Whenever the paedos turned up to the family home, the victimaposs mother would be ushered into another room while the victim was locked in a bedroom where the perverts would rape and take pictures of her. Authorities say that four men, including the dad, have been arrested and charged with rape, sexual assault and using a child for pornographic purposes, as the young girl bravely decided to speak out about her horric ordeal. Cops in India showed the victim pictures of around  men known to the family and believed to have been involved in the sick acts. But she was so traumatised by what her own flesh and blood had put her through that she couldnapost identy the suspects. I donapost remember any faces, she told police. Itaposs all a blur. The vile abuse began when the dadaposs friends would drunkenly tease and grope the victim in front of her apparently unconcerned parents. Men would come and take my mother into the bedroom, the victim explained.  I thought this was normal. And then my father pushed me into the room with strangers. Teachers living in the victimaposs neighbourhood first sounded the alarm when they noticed a change in her behaviour, leading them to ask about what was going on at home. Following a tip-off, the school then called in a counsellor from a womanaposs assistance group who then spoke to the girl the following day. It was then that the full details of the girlaposs horric plight came to light, after spending just four hours with a counsellor. The -year-old admitted how her dad would force her into a room with strangers and would make her take nude pictures of herself for the men that visited her. After missing her period for three months, the girl said that her parents took her to a doctor, who gave her an ultrasound and prescribed her some medicines.  Convinced that the girl was a victim of serial rape by at least  dferent men, the counsellor called in child welfare and she was removed from the family home and whisked off to a shelter. When asked whether she knew about contraceptives used to help avoid pregnancy and diseases, the -year-old said: No, no, we use condoms. The girlaposs mum was also violated by her dad and was similarly sexually exploited by men visiting the house. One of the men, who was first rebuked by the mum, then went on to assault the -year-old girl instead, the BBC reports. And the poor little girl had no sympathy from her mother who said her daughter had made the claims up in a bid to teach her parents a lesson after they had fallen out. [She] made up this story [of sexual exploitation] because she had been fighting with us and wanted to teach us a lesson, the mother said.

The volcano on White Island is highly volatile and could erupt again within days preventing recovery teams retrieving bodies, said authorities. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said: Iaposve spoken to many of those involved in the operation and they are very, very eager to get back there, they want to bring peopleaposs loved ones home. The volcano, a popular tourist day-tripper destination, erupted on Monday, spewing ash and steam over the island. We are now living with a growing sense of desperation to bring home those that we know are there and those we love, Whakatane Mayor Judy Turner told reporters. The frustration of those families most affected is completely understandable. No news is not good news for people in this situation. There were  people on the island, also known by its Maori name Whakaari, at the time of the eruption. Twenty-four of those were from Australia, nine from the United States, five from New Zealand, four from Germany, two each from China and Britain and one from Malaysia.  Nico Fournier, a volcanologist at New Zealandaposs geological science agency GNS Science, said monitoring equipment still active on the island put the risk of a further eruption over the next  hours at  per cent to  per cent. We believe that there is shallow magma, the molten rocks, which is driving the activity under the surface ... which is the level of tremor that is increasing, and it keeps increasing as we speak as well, Fournier told reporters. The consequence of those processes is that the situation remains highly volatile, he said.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched. Dunfermline have started winning games and we’ve started losing them.“I met Stevie at a reserve game recently and we were talking about how quickly things can turn.“It shows you thatyou put a couple of results together you’re right back up there. They’re in the play-off places where we need to get back to.“It’s a big game on Saturday, we need to be really positive and take the game to them.”The Dens gaffer is wary of the threat posed by Dunfermline frontman Kevin Nisbet, who has scored  goals in his last seven matches for the Pars.But he says,his team can supply the Dundee strikers with the service Nisbet has enjoyed at East End Park then it’ll be the home attackers making the headlines.He said: “Nisbet is a player I like.“He was a threat in the first game of the season and we’ve obviously seen what he can do since then.“They get the ball into the box for him. The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

The boys are working really hard and I think we do have what it takes. It’s just a case of getting a result next time, kicking on and believing.“We understand there is big expectation from the fans and they deserve better.“We are trying to recty it but we need big guts and to take games by the scruff of the neck.“We need everyone in the dressing-room to stand up and be counted.“Hopefully, once we get a result we can kick on and look up the table.”Their winless run may have continued at Gayfield where the Dark Blues were held to a - draw at the weekend but McGhee thinks there were some shoots of recovery in a second half where Dundee created a number of opportunities.“We showed a bit more character in the second half,” he added. “At the Queens game, the second half was pretty flat, this week we knew we couldn’t do the same thing.“I think we created a lot of chances and, on another day, could have scored another two or three goals.“We worked on attacking in the week leading up to the game and I think you could see that.“We had a lot of chances but, unfortunately, couldn’t put them away. We showed a bit of character but it’s not good enough for a club like Dundee going four games without winning.“We all know it and are aware of it – it’s something we are trying to recty as soon as possible.”As much as any chance of catching rivals United at the top has slipped away with the Tangerines opening up a very healthy gap, McGhee knows, having played in the Championship for a few years now, the seven-point dference to Inverness in second place isn’t insurmountable.“The last four results haven’t been good enough and people have been questioning the boys’ commitment and desire but we all try our heart out and sometimes things don’t come off.“We know it isn’t good enough and we are working really hard to recty it. We have a big second half of the season coming up, one that we’ll need to go on winning runs.“If you can do that it really helps and you shoot right back up the table. In this league, anybody can beat anyone.“I’m sure as soon as we get three points we’ll be back on the horse and kick on.”Next up is another tough one against an opponent in Dunfermline who have taken advantage of Dundee’s results to jump above the Dark Blues into third spot.McGhee said: “Dunfermline is a massive game, every one is right now, especially with the run we are on.#We need to put things right quickly.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da8284ae61f97.17313200-e1571310014829-620x372.jpg ","title":"labour member who notified party about candidate jim malone faces suspension","story":"A Labour party member has revealed he could be suspended after accusing Dundee West parliamentary candidate Jim Malone of antisemitism.But Graeme McKenzie, a member of the Dundee Labour Party executive committee, has said he felt duty-bound to report Mr Malone to the authorities.The complaint related to a video of Mr Malone taken at an event in .It is claimed the former firefighter compared the treatment of Palestinians to Jews in Nazi concentration camps.Mr McKenzie has said he would be prepared to take a suspension from the partyit helped to highlight the allegations against Mr Malone, which he described as #horrying#.He said: #I have been threatened with suspension from Labour because they claim I broke party rules by making comments which were in breach of those and to the detriment of the party.#However, I continue to believe that I had a duty to speak out to make the public and the party aware of what I had discovered.#I would do the same again and will continue to fight to have Mr Malone suspended pending an investigation.#I would still call upon him to stand down and I am prepared to remove myself from the executive committee and the partyit makes a loud enough noise to highlight my serious concerns about Mr Malone#s behaviour.#I have seen the evidence for myself and I continue to believe he was guilty of racism and  antisemitism.# vw, px\"  Labour bosses are under growing pressure to take action after it emerged that iniduals linked  to his campaign have been involved in sharing material which is allegedly anti -Semitic or racist online.Mr McKenzie said: #I have been approached by many executive group members telling me I did the right thing.#I have received strong support.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each. Also the bands sold tickets along with their merchandise to give an extra £ approx to the cause. We had a total of  people in attendancewhich is our best ever turnout.The best part though was how much everyone enjoyed what was a night of some of the best original music Argyll has to offer # and you can#t put a price on that. Well done to all who were there and supported the whole event.Dan and crew, Mojo organisersSir,Among the many concerns caused by you-know-what is the very real fear that hospitals and high street pharmacies will run out of vital medical supplies which would normally arrive from factories in Malta, Hungary and Poland.So why are generic medicines not made in Lochgilphead, in Campbeltown and in Rothesay  After all, calcium supplement tablets are made in Galashiels by a Japanese brewery company.Glasgow Health Board built a brand new wee factory on the Western Infirmary Glasgow University campus  years to manufacture some but not all of their requirements. Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash.

No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

flat.And to rub salt into the wounds of the -year-old widower, the social landlord is about to bump up his rent and have even sent a threatening reminder for pound arrears.Mr McLean first reported problems with an external roof pipe at his Galashiels property almost a year ago on December .Further problems developed after a new bathroom suite was fitted at his Talisman Avenue home during the summer.And it was only when wallpaper began peeling off his walls that action was finally taken to stop the dampness.Despite being issued with a dehumidier the former gamekeepers property is still damp and mould can be found in several rooms.Mr Mclean told us: \"I first noticed water leaking off the roof and an outside pipe and coming into the walls.\"The water had to be coming into the walls, but the workmen didnt think there was anything wrong.\"They did repairs to my taps inside but they wouldnt believe me that there was a problem with water getting into the walls.\"After the new bathroom was fitted the dampness smell became more noticeable, and within a few weeks my wallpaper began falling off.\"After I lost my we two years ago I took a real pride in my flat and decorated every room.\"I had the place beautul, but look at it now.\"Theres mould growing through the carpets, mould on the walls, the wallpaper has come off - how is someone meant to live in a house like this \"Electrical testing on the property also showed that several sockets were dangerous due to the encroaching dampness.And Mr Mclean has also developed a bad cough over the past few months.But the biggest blow for him has been SBHAs decision to increase his rent and also send out a warning letter.He added: \"While this was going on I went to a meeting with SBHA and they announced my rent would be going up from pound to almost pound per week - who would pay pound a week to live like this \"I just received another letter from them to sayI dont pay pound rent arrears as well they will take court action.\"My home has been ruined by them not repairing a leak and this how they treat me.\"Scottish Borders Housing Association deny that dampness issues were reported by Mr Mclean before October.But they admit they were called to his Talisman Avenue flat last December, and also carried out repairs to taps earlier in the year.A spokeswoman told us: \"In December  an inspection was carried out by SBHA with no further action at that time.\"Repairs relating to an immersion heater and also taps had been carried out in the property earlier in  and dampness issues were not raised on these occasions.\"The tenant contacted us on October  and a job line was raised including a specialist survey commissioned to investigate the cause of the problem, prior to instruction of appropriate works.\"Remedial works are currently on site following investigations regarding water ingress.\"The Selkirk-based housing association has also defended its planned rent increases.The spokeswoman added: \"In November , we carried out a consultation on the proposed rent levels for the following year, giving all , tenants the opportunity to provide feedback, via a wide iety of consultation

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

I agree that the majority prevails, but I think we have to realise thatyou win by one the winner canrsquot have all.Mr Hoy said he would agree there should be a threshold in future elections.He added: ldquoI understand why Kenny doesnrsquot support it because the SNP can barely secure  per cent, never mind  per cent, for independence.Candidates were then asked why they should be trusted by the public.Mr Sisson took this opportunity to point out that he wasnrsquot a politician and he was standing because he felt it was the right thing to do.Mr Whitfield suggested constituents believe those who did what they said they would do, adding: ldquoI think the Government breaking the law and having to be told by the Supreme Court that they have broken the law severely undermines the trust in politicians.Next, with Russia raised as a potential threat, candidates were asked about defence spending.MacAskill thought the defence budget should not change, saying: ldquoThe dficulty that faces our military is that everything is being put into nuclear weapons and Trident.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10338714.jpg?type=article-full","title":"cash-regulated-utility-like-water-ensure-free-msps-told","story":"Speaking at a meeting of Holyroodrsquos Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee on Tuesday, Adrian Roberts, the chief commercial officer for Link, called for action to ensure people are not charged for taking out their own cash describing it as a \"universal need\".It comes after the Herald revealed ministers have refused to intervene in the access-to-cash crisis ndash as it has emerged that around  free-to-use ATMs in Scotland have continued to shut down every week in the last year.Meanwhile, more than one-third of Scotlands bank branches have closed between January  and August this year.

However, the rate of change ies amongst council areas with some slowing more than others and some showing falling le expectancy.The figures also continue to show that those living in less deprived areas are expected to live longer, healthier lives than those in more deprived areas.Dr Nikki Thompson, deputy chair of Scottish Council at BMA Scotland, said: ldquoThese statistics leave us in absolutely no doubt that stark and unacceptable health inequalities persist across Scotland. It is  and we should not tolerate a society where those in some areas of the country will spend an extra  years in poor health compared to those living in Scotlandrsquos most affluent areas. We need much more concerted action on public health, particularly focussed on reducing inequalities, from all levels of Government.ldquoReducing health inequalities will need concerted action across many areas like low pay, poor educational outcomes and inadequate housing. These statistics must prompt continued and urgent action on all these areas and across all parts of Government.Professor Derek Bell OBE, president of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, said: ldquoThis report reaffirms what we have known since the Black Report on health inequalities in the early s that le expectancy - particularly healthy le expectancy - is lower in deprived areas and is multactorial.ldquoIt is signicant that progress on le expectancy has stalled in recent years, and the reasons for this will be complex.

It is estimated that around  out of  adults in Scotland are clinically obese.ldquoPrice promotions on foods that are high fat, sugar and salt are more likely to be attractive to people with less to spend on their weekly grocery shop. The College therefore support controls on price promotions of high fat, sugar and salt foods, and we back the promotion of healthier food. We also support the reduction of food portion and pack sizes, as well as retaining and strengthening the sugary drinks tax.ldquoBut healthy le style is important too, and we must ensure that we are a healthy and active nation through improved diet and exercise.ldquoAt a local level, Integration Joint Boards and Alcohol and Drug Partnerships can have a key role in tackling public health in communities, and we have already seen success in some areas.ldquoOver the long term, le expectancy in Scotland has increased but has stalled recently.ldquoWersquore focused on addressing the underlying causes that drive health inequalities, which has income inequality at its heart.

Anxious to win power by any means, all the parties in Scotlandhave put out literature which advocates tactical votingand fails to highlight candidatesrsquo party allegiances. We should vote, we are told, to stop the SNP or stop the Tories, to stop independence or stop Brexit. Scaremongering and demonising opponents are the order of the day.

All minds will be focussed on the prospect of a second independence referendum. Scotland will become the political crucible in which the UKrsquos future is forged.As this new chapter looms, we need to learn lessons from the election which is just ending. The campaign has raised many questions which need answered before Scotland can deal sensibly with the issue of its constitutional future.Most of these questions must be answered by the SNP and the broader Yes movement ndash as the matter in hand is independence. However, unionists have plenty of issues they must deal with too, as does the media.Letrsquos deal with the media first. Irsquom a journalist, so I should address the problems in my own house before looking at others. The media has failed the people at this election, or rather I should say, the BBC and the right-wing London press has failed.The right-wing press is what it is and what it has always been, and that will not change. Its hysterical, partisan ferocity is a continual un-healing wound which tarnishes the industry and the great number of hard-working, decent journalists in Britain, and the publications they work for, which are striving to tell the truth and do a pubic service.Just look at the way the story of the little boy lying on a hospital floor was treated. The Yorkshire Evening Post broke the story, The Mirror picked it up and ran with it, and then right-wing journalists, like the Daily rsquos Allison Pearson, peddled fake news that the image was staged.When you hear someone say lsquonever trust journalistsrsquo, we all know what papers theyrsquore talking about.The BBC has trashed its reputation throughout this election. When senior reporters like Laura Kuenssberg tweet out fake claims saying Labour supporters assaulted an aide of Health Secretary Matt Hancock, theyrsquore destroying journalism. Itrsquos simply disinformation. A student journalist knows that you mustnrsquot disseminate information without checking and confirming.Perhaps, the biggest election row was Boris Johnson refusing to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. However, many felt more than a little uncomfortable about the fact that eventhe interview happened, it would see the current boss of The Spectatorinterviewing the former editor of the Spectator .The media clearly favoured the status quo at the last independence referendum. Journalism must do better as Scotland enters this new phase of its political le. Thatrsquos the first lesson.Lesson two: Unionism must do better too. Not only will a rehash of Project Fear explode in unionist faces, it will do the public no service. The issues must be intelligently debated not subjected to hyperventilating propaganda.The unionist base must also behave decently this time. At the last referendum, Yes voters were subjected to torrential abuse. Nazi slurs were thrown around with abandon. Ugly demonstrations by hardline loyalists following the referendum result seemed to confirm every Yes voters worst fears about what the No base was really like.In turn, the SNP must reign in its own base. The extremes of the Yes movement are among the most vile in British politics. If itrsquos not taking part in purity purges and circular firing squads, itrsquos perpetuating conspiracy theories and indulging in sustained, organised abuse of those seen as enemies.Now letrsquos turn to the SNP and the Yes movement. For years now, the mantra of another independence referendum has been constant. Yet wersquore moving towards a possible second referendum with little change in the discussion since .Wersquove had some debate on currency. Instead of the  plan to keep the pound, SNP members voted to replace the pound with a new currency as soon as ldquopracticable. Other economic proposals in the Growth Commission may lead Scotland towards more austerity in the event of independence. We need a national ndash not a party ndash discussion on this.Moderate Yes voters, of which Irsquom one, arenrsquot prepared to blunder forward, as part of a nationalist dream, without fine detail and honest answers on the big issues.Will there be a confirmatory referendumScotland votes Yes  No voters cannot be treated as Remain voters were in England. Their cares matter. Independence cannot bring ision and hate. Many undecided voters may also back Yesthey know that a confirmatory referendum will call the whole thing off should negotiations between Edinburgh and London turn into Brexit Mark II.Do we really think a bare win ndash - to Yes ndash is good enough  Isnrsquot that a recipe for national ision and anger  Should the barrier be set higher ndash %  We donrsquot know as we havenrsquot discussed it as a country.How will negotiations with London be undertaken  What about borders  Brexit has shown us that borders are brutal stumbling blocks, killing trade and separating people. Will there be a hard border What about any orce settlement ndash whatrsquos the cost  How will negotiations with the EU for re-entry go  What will be the terms of re-entry What about our defence and security  What will be the composition of our armed forces  Our intelligence services  What about Nato ndash how would it respond to the removal of Trident from Scotland The last time we discussed these issues substantively as a nation was . Times have changed. As long as independence remained on the agenda, the debate should have remained updated. It hasnrsquot. Independence is becoming an empty slogan like Get Brexit Done. It needs to be meaningful. The Yes movement has to offer a refreshed prospectus.Therersquos no fresh start tomorrow ndash just a new chapter. This election has shown us how badly parties and the media have failed. Scotland deserves better as the future looms ndash for that to happen we need informed national debate.This cannot be left to the SNP alone.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As an obstetrician, I have written often about the priority we should put on the health of our pregnant women and families as they truly hold the future health of the nation in their hands.We are less good at talking about the end of le, dying and the bereavement that follows. Circumstances surrounding a loved one’s death can be remembered by those left behind for the rest of their lives. The impact on families of a ‘bad death’ can be devastating and, of course, there is also an effect on healthcare professionals who deal with death and dying frequently.I remember a weekend working on the maternity unit when I was pregnant with my first child. I met a young woman who was at the same stage as me, but her baby had stopped moving. Initial scans had failed to find a heartbeat. Often this is when I can use my experience to find that elusive heartbeat, but not that day. I had to tell that young couple that their baby, their child, had died – feeling so guilty that mine was still alive. At the end of my sht, I felt exhausted, bereft and deeply sad.: Le expectancy going backwards in ‘many parts’ of Scotland, report finds: Grieving Scottish couple’s stillbirth charity to benefit from Christmas concertIt is often said that time heals but I am not sure about that. I think the passage of time can make it easier to deal with grief, but the pain may never leave us.Conversations are starting around ‘living’ grief and bereavement. As the numbers of people living with dementia increases, the experience of their carers is becoming a focus. They are living with and caring for someone, often a lelong partner, who may no longer care for them or even recognise them.Not a time of joy for allCarers may be isolated, restricted by the frailty and confused behaviour of the person they look after. Comments come from others like “at least they’re still with you”, yet they are grieving for the person they have already lost. For example, “I’m not a widow yet, but I don’t feel married either”, as one lady told me. Carers feel guilty and internalise their own emotions. Together in Dementia Everydayoffers a support network for the carers of those with dementia, allowing those dficult thoughts and feelings to be surfaced.I recently attended an NHS Education for Scotland conference that used the power of patient stories to explore the impact of bereavement on people. The main realisation was that we need to give our staff the permission, time, space, and support to discuss these cases as teams, exploring feelings and emotions, not just clinical facts. It often feels safer to focus on the latter, but the former may prove far more therapeutic. This, of course, can apply to the conversations we also have with patients and families and you can have with your own families at home.Why indeed am I writing an article about death and bereavement, when you perhaps want to read something uplting at this time of year The reality is that Christmas is not a time of joy for everyone – loss can be felt keenly, absence of a family member all the more obvious, a strong sense of missing someone or shared experiences, a trigger for grief suppressed. So at this time of preparation for celebration often with family, take some time to really talk, to acknowledge grief and even the awkwardness about mentioning it. I guarantee both you and the person you are talking to will feel better for it.

By the age of about  I realised this was increasingly unlikely to happen, partly based on the fact that most other boys were at least a foot taller than me by this point, but largely based on my complete lack of ability. But as I lay on my bed looking up at my carefully curated collage of adverts torn out of FHM and Loaded magazines, Michael Jordan looked back at me and told me to Just Do It.Whether it was inspired by Gary Gilmore’s final words before being executed doesn’t really matter, in  Nike’s trademark slogan was being plastered all over the world and  years later it’s still going strong. It’s enabled and empowered new generations of go-getters and high achievers – the ultimate mantra to prove anyone from anywhere could achieve anything in lethey put their mind to it. Wake up, get up, and Just Do It. Do early morning yoga classes, do a gym session at lunch, and do a creative writing course in the evenings so you can do your blog. Do a marathon at the weekend. Do that job promotion, do that new business plan and do the extra hours that you know will pay off one day. Do work emails in the rain whilst ignoring your children playing rugby, do amazing meals with exotic ingredients imported from all over the world and do luxury holidays filled with doing even more stuff. Fill your le with acts of great signicance and meaning and they will build statues in your honour. Just F***ing Do It.Of course, we also need to remind ourselves that we need to do the washing up, do the laundry and do the weekend shop too. All the stuff that Jordan and Charles Barkley never seem to mention in their adverts, like doing the car insurance renewal. We live in a world of perpetual doing. The list simply doesn’t end. There’s never a point where you get to check your list and say with a smug smile, “I’ve got nothing to do.”Which is perhaps exactly why we need to force ourselves to do less. Give ourselves time to switch off and do absolutely nothing.A few thousand years ago our lives were a lot more simple. Not necessarily easier, but certainly less filled with stuff to do. You got up, ate, fed your livestock, went in search of food, spent some time sharpening spears or arrows, looked for more food, then maybe whiled away a couple of hours making fires or doing some recreational drawing on the walls of your cave. Today – thanks to the miracle of smartphones – we can’t go  minutes with checking to seesomeone’s emailed a message that we probably don’t want to read, or updated their profile with a picture we don’t want to see.Not only are we stuffing our lives with more stuff to do on a daily hourly minutely basis, but we’ve more choices than ever before. A few years ago one national supermarket chain had  ieties of air freshener,  types of rice,  ieties of cola and a mind-blowing  ieties of coffee. No self-respecting café in  would ever dare offer you the binary option of black or white. We want dferent blends from dferent countries with dferent methods and dferent syrups and dferent milks and dferent foams.All this stuff squeezed into exactly the same amount of hours in the day that our cave-dwelling ancestors had. We simply don’t have the time for things to go wrong, sosomeone dares behave in a manner that dfers slightly from our own expectation of acceptable behaviour – for example, eating a boiled egg on a crowded commuter train – then a whole arsenal of toys are going to be ejected from the pram.Manners have nothing to do with class or wealth – as so frequently demonstrated by a iety of overpaid public figures – they cost nothing, after all. But they do take time, and in our busy little bubbles that’s almost more valuable than money. We’re cash rich and time poor, so who gives monkey’swe offend a few people by clipping our nails on the train or pushing to the front of the queue  You’ll probably never see those iniduals again anyway. We’ve all got a million things to do and are constantly reminded of the million things other people are doing, so the faster we can get things done the better, right  Well wrong. The faster we get things done the faster we get them done. Doing things properly always takes a lot more time, as Ralph Waldo Emerson said: “Manners require time, and nothing is more vulgar than haste.”Whether you’re doing the weekly daily hourly grocery shop, taking a group of hyperactive kids to the cinema, or signing up at your local meditation class, please, forget just looking after number one, and be on the look-out for number two as well. It’s much more dangerous when it hits the air-cooling device.We’re not talking Mother Teresa levels of selflessness here, just a few moments of clarity when we acknowledge that perhaps flossing your undercarriage within two feet of someone’s face in the changing room, might not be to everyone’s delight. A little lightbulb that pings on as you smugly sprint to the front of the newly opened checkout that tells you maybe other people have been waiting a little longer.We don’t need to Just Do It or Live Le to the Max. Turn off your f***ing phone and experience the truly le-changing miracles of doing one thing at a time. Only when we can treat ourselves to this level of kindness, will we be able to pass on that kindness to others.Simon Grfin is the author of F***ing Good Manners .

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party.

I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#.

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon!

The recreational society also employed the services of an independent surveyor who # using the drawings developed by the council for the school # drew up three dferent locations all of which were away from the pitch but within the existing school boundary.In a letter to council leader Margaret Davidson this week, Mr Blackford # a former chair of the recreational society # said that the alternative plans which would have allowed the new development while preserving the playing field seem to have been #rejected out of hand without adequate explanation#.He added that there was considerable concern that the council was going ahead with the proposals without #seeking to achieve a consensus of the parents and the wider community#.Mr Blackford invited Ms Davidson to host a meeting with him in Dunvegan at her earliest convenience so they could #listen to the voices of the community and give careful consideration as to how we can proceed with the school development whilst securing the playing field for this and future generations#., Mr Blackford said that the investment in the school was welcome but added that the plans #cannot come at the cost of the football pitch with no clear replacement plan in place#.He said that as the playing field in Dunvegan was the only one in the north-west of Skye, it would be #a disaster for Dunvegan and the surrounding areas# to see it go.At a meeting held in Dunvegan village hall last week, Highland Council estate strategy manager Robert Campbell said that the decision on the council#s preferred option had not #been taken lightly#. However, he added that the #best decision for this school is to build it on the playing fields#.The finance package for the phased build will comprise  per cent Scottish Government early learning and childcare funding and  per cent from Highland Council. The facilities will include a nursery, kitchen, dining hall, games hall and ancillary accommodation.Skye councillor John Finlayson sought to impress on those present at the meeting that with a review of capital spending due to take place within the council in the next few months the money earmarked for the first phase could not be guaranteed unless the development became active.At the public meeting, local youngsters Lewis MacLeodand Sam Maclellandpresented a petition to the council in opposition to the local authority plans which had more than  signatures."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/001WH2911NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 29th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"air pollution in belfast is equivalent to smoking 94 cigarettes a","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Belfast are exposed to a health risk that is equivalent to smoking  cigarettes each year, a leading charity has warned..pushAir pollution is so bad in Belfast that anyone living in the city has the same increased risk of death as a person who smokes  cigarettes a year.The British Heart Foundationhas carried out research which has shed light on the devastating impact of air pollution across Northern Ireland.Belfast has the highest average daily level of air pollution out of all local authorities here and is closely followed by Lisburn and Castlereagh, where residents breathe in the equivalent of  cigarettes every year.This is closely followed by Ards and North Down, where residents breathe in the equivalent of  cigarettes a year, and Antrim and Newtownabbey and Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon, where residents smoke the equivalent of  and  cigarettes a year respectively.Fine particulate matter called PM. is the most dangerous kind of air pollution, finding its way into the circulatory system when inhaled.BHF research has shown that PM. can have a seriously detrimental effect to heart health, making existing conditions worse, and increasing the risk of heart attack and stroke.Fearghal McKinney, head of BHF in Northern Ireland, said: \"Air pollution is a major public health emergency, and over many years it has not been treated with the seriousness it deserves.\"Thats why we hosted an air pollution event in Belfast that discussed its deadly impacts on our health and you will be hearing a lot more from us on this important issue.\"Unless we take radical measures now to curb air pollution, in the future we will look back on this period of inaction with shame.\"We are calling on our local councils to introduce more effective monitoring of air pollution, so we can understand the true scale of the problem we face.\"The charitys warning comes after BHF NI hosted their Act on Air Pollution: Save Lives event in Belfast.The event included a  of experts discussing the impact of air pollution on peoples health and what can be done about it.The new figures come as BHF NI urges the next Westminster government to urgently adopt into law tougher World Health Organisationair pollution limits.The UK currently subscribes to EU limits on levels of PM., which are not as stringent as those set by the WHO.Before Parliament was dissolved for the general election, the Westminster government introduced the Environment Bill, which set out a commitment to binding targets for fine particulate matter, but did not commit to adopting World Health Organisation guideline limits.However, in July , the Department for Environment and Rural Affairspublished findings which found that implementing WHO guidelines on air pollution is \"technically feasible\".BHF NI has said that such a commitment is a crucial step in protecting heart health.Binding  targets, set in law, will ensure effective action to reduce air pollution and the risk it poses to peoples heart and circulatory health, it has argued.Mr McKinney added: \"The last Westminster government accepted that it is possible to implement tougher WHO air pollution limits, and it must now do so to protect our health.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38776348.ece/f284b/AUTOCROP/w620/FirstMass.jpg","title":"first mass held at expresbyterian church in

Having such a desire to make every festive period as special as possible for her family, she was determined to fight on to enjoy one last Christmas.Now remembering their music-loving mum as this Christmas approaches, daughters Jennerand Samanthaare planning to ensure the family celebrate together in honour of Ellie.\"When mum was first diagnosed, it hit the whole family hard. She had her voice box removed and couldnt speak for the last  years of her le,\" explained Samantha.\"She coped with that surprisingly well and her health then improved for about six years. Then three years ago, a lump came back and, at the start of , mum was told she had six to  months to live.\"Mum said she wanted it to be business as usual. She wouldnt talk about it as she didnt want to dwell on it.\"Her way of coping was to use humour - everyone knows mummy for always having a laugh. She became very accepting of it and were a very close family, so we were all there for each other.\"Despite the devastating diagnosis she had received, the independent-minded Ellie wanted to continue enjoying the past-times that always made her happy - attending country music gigs and catching up with friends at the Marie Curie day hospice in Lisburn.\"In November , mums condition started to really deteriorate,\" said Samantha.\"We went to a country gig on the Friday night and she wasnt great the next morning. She texted Jenner and for mum, you knew it was serious, as she would rarely ask for help.\"She went to the Royal Victoria Hospital that day and it became clear mum wasnt going to get better.\"It was at this point - in the run up to Christmas - that the grandmother of three was forced to accept she would be spending her last few months of le at the Marie Curie Hospice in Belfast.However, despite the worries the family had about her being away from home, Samantha explained that they, \"felt peace as soon as they arrived\" and were able to make that last Christmas a memorable one.\"Mum arrived at the hospice on December . The room was beautul and it was looking out over the courtyard, which had a great big tree and was filled with fairy lights, like Santas grotto,\" said Samantha.\"We brought Christmas trees with us and mummy sat in her chair like Mrs Claus with her Christmas earrings in.\"One of mums passions was music. Over the few weeks she was at the hospice, she got to see so many performances, from a bagpiper, to a harpist and local school choirs - she really enjoyed it.\"The staff at the hospice asked us our plans for Christmas Day and the chef offered to make us all a turkey dinner.\"On December , one of the doctors askedwe would like to have mummy home for Christmas.\"On Christmas morning, we all opened our presents in our PJs at the hospice, we had the Christmas tunes on and mummy was loving it. Jenner left to get the dinner on and we all arrived a few hours later.\"We ate dinner together and played our family tradition of bingo, which we rigged, so mummy won. It was such a joyful day for us all.\"The next day, things dramatically changed. It was like mummy had used every ounce of strength to reach Christmas and now she was ready to go.\"Mummy passed away peacefully on December . She was surrounded by her whole family.\"This Christmas will be business as usual and well all celebrate together at my house. It wont be easy, but well all be there for each other. There was no way we could cancel Christmas - mummy would be fuming.\""},{"url":null,"title":"voters head to the polls across northern ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed. We were only  minutes in and pan-nationalism and pan-unionism both seemed in tatters – except in North and South Belfast of course.Eastwood has enjoyed a good campaign. The nadir of his party’s  removal from Westminster left some wondering whether the SDLP would ever . He now stands of the brink of heading here along with a colleague. The SDLP leader may also have been buoyed by the apparent photo endorsement from Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Interesting that, given it is only eleven months since the launch of the “historic partnership” between the SDLP and, er, Fianna Fáil — a tie-up rejected by the SDLP’s MP-to-be in South Belfast.Naomi Long performed solidly and it has been a fine year for her party, its vote up % in the council elections and % in the Europeans. But a First-Past-the-Post contest remains dficult terrain for Alliance. Another issue is that Westminster contests are for the true believers. In , those identying as unionist or nationalist were twice as likely to vote as those eschewing such labels.The debate moved onto the health crisis and the associated problem of Assembly restoration. It was everyone ’s fault that it was mothballed. Not their party’s responsibility. Oh no. Michelle O’Neill gave no ground on an Irish Language Act, insisting it was a right. “It’s not an either or” in terms of a Language Act versus dealing with the health crisis was her line. Good luck with those talks on Monday, Secretary of State.Each representative performed creditably. But how much any of Tuesday night really mattered is questionable. The viewing figure for Sunday night’s UTV leaders’ debate was just shy of ,. More watched the programme immediately afterwards, where the contestants had to eat grubs in a jungle. Maybe UTV host Marc Mallett should have made similar demands upon the politicians. An internal BBC document this week showed less than half of - year olds watch BBC in an average week — and younger electors are least likely to vote anyway.A viewing figure of , for an election debate is not a bad figure, but over , people voted in Northern Ireland’s  Westminster election.So,  out of  voters last time didn’t bother tuning in.

Final opinion polls suggested that while the Conservatives remained in front, they were not guaranteed an overall majority. The Prime Ministers day got off to a bumpy start after he was accused of hiding in a fridge on live TV to avoid a reporter pressing him for an interview on ITVs Good Morning Britain. Mr Johnson insisted he was \"fighting for every vote\" as his campaign tour took him through South Yorkshire, the East Midlands and South Wales. \"This could not be more critical. It could not be tighter. I just say to everybody the risk is very real that we could tomorrow be going into another hung parliament,\" he told reporters. His itinerary included photo opportunities on a milk round - intended to highlight his promise to deliver Brexit - and at a bakery to illustrate his \"oven-ready\" deal. He later concluded his campaigning by attending a large rally at the Copper Box in Stratford, east London, a venue used during the London  Olympics. The Tory leader askedthe crowd of several hundred were \"pumped up\", \"energised\" and \"motivated\", to which they shouted \"yes\". Mr Johnson said: \"I sincerely hope so, everybody.\" Mr Corbyn started his last day of campaigning in Glasgow South West with a promise of \"real hope\" for voters affected by years of austerity. Later, at a rally of supporters in Middlesbrough, he brushed off the evidence of the polls to insist Labour could still win. \"Of course we are going to do it - no problem at all,\" Mr Corbyn said.\"We are campaigning all over the country, with thousands of people on the streets carrying a message of hope.\" He said Labour had raised £m for its election campaign so far, largely from small donations.Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson was concentrating her efforts on the area around London and Surrey, where the party is hoping to pick up seats. They include Esher and Walton, where polls have suggested Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab may be vulnerable despite a majority of more than , at the  general election. Ms Swinson said the polls showed it was still \"absolutely possible\" to deny the Tories an overall majority through tactical voting. \"We know from past elections that very often voters who vote tactically come to that conclusion in the final hours before they cast their vote,\" she added. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was out with SNP candidates in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Dunbartonshire, while Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage was in South Yorkshire. Speaking in Doncaster, Mr Farage said he was hoping for \"very, very heavy rain\" in the town today in the belief that it would depress the votes of the other parties. \"I know that people who are going to vote for us will turn out because they absolutely believe in our message. They believe in their hearts as well as in their heads,\" he said. A final constituency-by-constituency poll by YouGov forecast that the Conservatives were on course for a -seat majority. However, it warned that the margin of error, together with the unknown impact of tactical voting, meant a hung parliament was still possible, as is a larger Tory majority. The pollsters, who have analysed more than , voter interviews over the past week, calculated the Tories would win  seats and Labour . A -seat majority would be the best Tory result since Margaret Thatchers showing in , but it is sharply down from the -seat victory margin that was forecast just two weeks ago. Chris Curtis, YouGovs political research manager, said: \"The margins are extremely tight. \"Small swings in a small number of seats, perhaps from tactical voting and a continuation of Labours recent upward trend, means that we cannot currently rule out a hung parliament.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38776388.ece/ae867/BINARY/F694814_Anne_Madden.jpg","title":"why this general election is about more than brexit business education union and green leaders tell us their priorities","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We want ato genuine power-sharing, but we are clear that this must be on the basis of implementing human rights and equality for all.\"We know that this election has be dominated by Brexit. What our members will demand of all the candidates is that they reject a disastrous no-deal exit, and that they commit to protect our economy, our rights and the Good Friday Agreement itself from the damage that any Brexit will cause.Patricia McKeown\"Members who work in health and social services are taking industrial action due to the pay deficit they suffer compared to England, Scotland and Wales.\"Our services limp on with unsafe staffing levels, poor morale and crisis waiting lists.\"We expect all parties to commit to securing the pay justice that the workers deserve and that the service needs.\"In the absence of our devolved institutions, we will continue to press for Westminster to deliver. We have welcomed the interventions that have been made around equal marriage and the right to choose, but now Westminster must step up and deliver the Bill of Rights that is their responsibility under the Good Friday Agreement.\"We will not accept any attempt to repeal or replace the Human Rights Act.\"Despite the £bn the DUP secured through their confidence and supply deal with the Tories, no one should be under any illusion that austerity has ended.\"Health, social care and education are all seriously underfunded and the resources that these vital services need must be delivered from Westminster.\"BusinessRoger Pollen, head of external affairs, Federation of Small Business NI:\"While businesses have not relished an election in December, there is a recognition that the current political situation has reached an impasse, so this may serve to break the parliamentary deadlock.\"The big loser in the process so far has been the way that domestic issues have effectively been sidelined.Roger Pollen\"All candidates need to focus not only on Brexit but on all the other issues which affect business as well, such as infrastructure, skills, business support and the scourge of late payments.\"We certainly hope that on the other side of this election some Brexit certainty can be provided.

Yet we know the climate emergency and air pollution will not factor much in this election debate.\"A sht away from driving to healthier, clean alternatives such as public transport, walking and cycling is the best way to reach a zero-carbon future.Anne Madden\"However, these are devolved matters for the Assembly to tackle. Since Stormont collapsed more than , days ago, we have been left with a massive democratic deficit.\"But while Brexit continues to dominate the political discourse and will do so for years to come, radical decisions on reallocating the transport budget to encourage more of us to walk and cycle will, I fear, continue to be parked.\"EducationGeri Cameron, president, National Association of Head Teachers :\"At the beginning of this year, I travelled to Westminster and gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee to assist with their Inquiry into Education Funding in Northern Ireland. A report with some very positive recommendations was published and then progress halted.\"If you ask me what will the election mean for Northern Ireland in terms of education, it is hard to knowit will make any dference, with education being a devolved matter, but the NAHT took the opportunity over the last few weeks to engage with all local political parties and discuss what needs to change in education.\"School budgets are still at breaking point. Given the increasing demands on schools and the vital role they play in society, we urgently need a funding settlement that commits to year-on-year, real-terms funding increases for all schools to support the education of young people in these uncertain times. Our young people need the best possible education to prepare them to meet the future with confidenceGeri Cameron\"It is now widely recognised within the education system in Northern Ireland that fewer people are stepping forward to take up leadership roles in schools.\"A career that was once highly sought-after is becoming less and less attractive as decision-makers fail to invest in schools and educators and to prioritise the wellbeing of those working in education.\"A double strategy is needed to, firstly, support school leaders to ensure that these great leaders remain in their role and secondly, to identy teachers who can be supported into leadership roles in the future.\"We cannot wait another , days for change.

But, there is a risk that it will be implemented in a heavy-handed way and that’s the concern that I’m hearing across the country.Mr Howlin askedthe Government could give reassurance to childminders that they would not be prosecuted for non-compliance.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said often children are minded by someone they know or an au pair for a few hours every day and it is convenient for parents who cannot or do not want to put their children into a creche.“We don’t want to over-regulate, undermine or get rid of that system becausewe did it would be disaster for tens of thousands of people would find that they didn’t have any way to look after their kids any more.“We definitely don’t want to over-regulate, or be too heavy-handed in any reforms that we bring in, in this area.”“At the same time we do need to put children first and we can’t ignore the fact that there are some children who are being minded in homes that aren’t very safe.“Those children could get injured, and there are health and safety issues in those houses that are providing informal childcare at the moment.“We also need to bear in mind that some people who are childminders – as we learned to our detriment when it came to foster parents in the past – had a bad record when it came to how they dealt with children, and we need to make sure that we don’t make those mistakes again.“So, this is a work in progress. I think we all acknowledge we need to get the balance right in terms of protecting children, but also making sure that we don’t close down an entire informal sector of childminding which serves families well but we need to get the balance right.”Mr Howlin questioned some of the requirements the Government has proposed for childminders, askingthey are necessary.“Officials have admitted that childminders must sign up to strict standards of care, or face prosecution. For example, Garda vetting is clearly essential but do childminders need to have a level five qualication in order to continue to operate as a childminder ”“Providing a safe and caring environment for children does not necessarily require that level of formal qualications, and there are many iniduals involved in childminding right now, who never had the opportunity to go to third level education.“This requirement is seen by those rightly as being extraordinarily onerous. Childminders are also concerned about the level of inspection of their family homes that may result from these new regulations,” he said.“There needs to be greater recognition that childminding is an activity carried out in the private space of people’s homes, rather than in any formal or structured business setting.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ocado sees boost in customers looking for vegan christmas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

Insurance companies representing the Weinstein Company would cover the settlement’s cost, according to the New York Times.The settlement’s terms remain uncertain. Eighteen of the alleged victims would split . million dollars , with no inidual receiving more than , dollars .A separate . million dollarswould go towards those involved in a class-action case, the New York attorney general’s suit and any future claimants, the New York Times reported.It is shameful that  million dollars of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey WeinsteinLawyers Douglas H Wigdor and Kevin MintzerMs Geiss said: “Now that The Weinstein Company is in bankruptcy and Harvey is about to stand to trial, this settlement will ensure that all survivors have the chance for recovery and can move forward without Harvey’s damaging lock on their careers.”Lawyer Thomas Giuffra said the agreement was the same deal announced several months ago but with more punitive provisions aimed at forcing those who were holding out to accept it.In a statement that included the names of several other lawyers from his firm, Mr Giuffra said: “The most troubling aspect of this settlement is a punitive provision designed to force victims to settle.“Shockingly, any funds that would have been allocated to claims from the settlement fund for non-settling claimants would be turned over to Harvey and Robert Weinstein to defend against their claims in court.“We understand that many victims have been so emotionally devastated and drained by this process that they cannot go on. But this proposed settlement does not allow for a truly voluntary choice.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Weinstein faces criminal charges in the new year Lawyers Douglas H Wigdor and Kevin Mintzer said they reject the notion that it was the best possible settlement, especially because it penalises those who continue their lawsuits.They also called it “shameful that  million dollars of the settlement is going to the lawyers for the directors who we alleged enabled Harvey Weinstein”.Other lawyers praised the deal, including Steve Berman in Seattle and Elizabeth Fegan in Chicago.Mr Berman said: “Given the hard legal issues involved this allows for some decent justice for the victims and therefore we are pleased with the settlement.”Ms Fegan said the settlement helps ensure women will be compensated, particularly since Weinstein is in bankruptcy proceedings and some court rulings have resulted in the dismissal of many claims.She said: “Our clients have shouldered a heavy burden, fighting a battle on behalf of all survivors to create a victims’ fund that will be available for every woman who was abused by Weinstein to make a confidential claim.“Harvey Weinstein stripped the survivors of everything — dignity, dreams, careers, and money. There is no amount of money that could restore what he took from the survivors. But a settlement will finally give the survivors a safe and confidential place in which to share their stories and receive the justice that the courts have withheld.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Harvey Weinstein leaving court following the hearing The  million dollars is part of a larger pool of . million dollars , with the remainder going to the Weinstein companies, general unsecured creditors and lawyers for defendants, Ms Fegan said.She said at least  actresses and former Weinstein employees who had sued the movie mogul for accusations ranging from sexual misconduct to rape had agreed to the deal.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season, they won the Grade D final and after a gutsy display, with goals at the right time, lted the McDevitt Cupon Tuesday afternoon at Celtic Park. The decisive score came in the st minute with a winning goal from St Conors midfielder Eoin Mullan. The sides met in the group stages and it was the Tyrone side who prevailed. As predicted by St Conors coach Declan Toner, the final went right down to the wire. googletag.cmd.push St Ciarans got into their groove in the second-half and looked the likely winners, but St Conors dug in and always had a response. Sean OConnell scored - in vain for Ballygawley, while Ryan Mallons runs from midfield gave the Tyrone side the impetus for their comeback. Oliver Wasoski opened the scoring for St Ciarans with the first of three goals in a frantic opening  minutes. Ben Murphy pounced on a rebound when Tommy Rodgers shot came off the bar, before dispatching to the bottom corner of the net to level the score. Then came a second St Conors goal from James ONeill, after he linked with effective ball-winner JP Hasson.

St Conors led - to - at the break and with a battling defensive effort kept themselves in command until the game sprang into le in the nd minute.

Fintan McGlinchey squeezed home goal and St Conors were back in business, but it was St Ciarans who were in command with midfielder Mallon driving forward at will. St Ciarans edged ahead for only the second time in the game with an Oisin Neill goal after  minutes. The St Conors response was instant. In a move involving centre-back Conor Kearney, Mullan had a shot blocked on the line by Paul McGinley before the Glenullin man bundled the ball over the line.

Whether the issue was support for planning applications, working for inward investment, attending education or social security benefit appeals it is my view that constituency work is the cornerstone of any elected representative.“As an elected representative for over  years I am proud to say that I have been a voice for all sections of our community, irrespective of religious affiliation or political opinion. I am your voice and will continue to be that voice in Mid Ulster with your support.“This election has been brought about at the behest of a British government that has failed the people. That same government has forced signicant financial cuts to the Stormont budget leading to cuts in health, cuts in education, cuts in infrastructure and cuts in every department of the Assembly.“This election has been brought about because of a failed policy on Brexit which has the potential to bring economic chaos across the north of Ireland. It is time to send a clear message to the British government that the people of Mid Ulster oppose your cuts, your austerity and oppose being forced out of the EU.“A new Ireland is achievable and I am calling for a strategic programme to plan for a referendum on Irish unity to be put in place. We need to bring together people from all sections of Irish society including political, business, education, health and many more to create the vision for the future of this island.”“Only by voting Sinn Feacutein – Molloy X – can you send that clear message.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

in Capitol Hill, the Daacuteil, Brussels and Downing Street.“We’re on the EU side of the negotiating table and with our MEPs, MPs, TDs, MLAs we’ve certainly made a dference.“Sinn Feacutein has also delivered for East Derry.“We have led the way by decentralizing the DAERA headquarters to Ballykelly and bringing high quality public sector jobs to the north west.“As Minister for Infrastructure, Chris Hazzard delivered the A and the Dungiven bypass after decades of waiting.“Sinn Feacutein education ministers invested in the schools estate across the constituency and we have also delivered on community and sports facilities. “Sinn Feacutein is committed to delivering on investment and jobs across the constituency and improving the infrastructure including roads and broadband. “Sinn Feacutein is also committed to protecting our environment and natural heritage, and to effectively tackling the Climate Emergency through urgent and concerted action.“Sinn Feacutein remains fully invested and committed to the Good Friday Agreement.“The current political impasse is unsustainable and unacceptable and Sinn Feacutein stands ready to form a credible executive.“We want to see a new Assembly and a new kind of politics in the New year is what we’re working towards.“We want an Executive which is to be credible, delivering on issues such as public sector pay, safe staffing levels in the health service, investment in our schools, economic policies that deliver prosperity for all and that invests in rural communities, and a mitigation package that protects people from Tory welfare reform.“This is the election of a generation because what the people decide now will shape the direction of our politics, economy and future for years to come.“Discussion about our constitutional future is clearly on the agenda.“It is now a question of when notthe referendum on Irish unity will be held.“In April , the EU made a declaration which says that in the event of a successful referendum on Irish unity, the North would automatically come back into the EU with the rest of Ireland.“Irish unity is a means to enjoy many more benefits than what the union with Britain has on offer.“A stark choice is opening up between the narrow, inward-looking vision of Brexit Britain and the open inclusive vision of a New Ireland.“We’re without doubt entering a decade of opportunity where the freedom to choose our own future will be decided by all of the people on this island alone.“The opportunity now exists over this new decade to bring people together.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It came from a poor line-out which saw Derry lose possession and Enniscorthy broke quickly with second row Tomas Stamp scoring and Ivan Poole converting for the first of seven tries.Enniscorthy, with just one defeat in seven games ahead of this one, had the lead they wanted and they picked their moments again and again to frustrate Derrry. The home side looked short on ideas against a disciplined defence with brief forays by the energetic Simon Logue giving glimmers of hope, but the final pass did not live up to the build up.Enniscorthy were devastatingly efficient and when prop Sam Duffy was yellow-carded on  minutes the visitors wasted no time in striking again, a line-out ending with quick passing which opened Derry up for Ivan Jacob to score right under the posts. An easy conversion for Poole made it -.A frustrating first half ended on a positive note for Derry with Alex McDonnell converting a penalty to get the hosts on the scoreboard, but a big effort was needed second halfthis was going to go anywhere for OKanes side. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The next score was crucial in this one and Derry began the second period positively, but within ten minutes the comeback looked beyond them as Enniscorthy, so clinical, hit two more scores. Davy Murphy hit the visitors third try to put daylight between the teams and after another yellow card, this time to Derrys Dara Gill, Poole scored and converted to make the score a daunting - with just  minutes played.This Derry team are not known for giving in however and to their credit they responded well to score their first try. David Ferguson was the driving force behind the period of pressure which eventually led to the score, with McDonell eventually picking his way through the Enniscorthy line to score a try which he also converted.Any hope of a comeback was killed inside four minutes however when David ODwyer replied for Enniscorthy to make it -. Kept comingAt this stage the win was Enniscorthys but Derry still kept coming. A yellow card for Enniscorthys Paddy Waters offered a glimmer of a hope of a losing bonus point and when Callum OHagan scored to take the game to -, it became a real possibility. One more score would have given Derry that point but in the dying seconds of the game, two misplaced passes gave Kidd and Dunne simple scores, to put an emphatic score on the result that Derry did not deserve.All eyes now turn to the game at Midleton this week, with Derry desperate to get another away win to take the pressure off. This defeat sees Derry drop two places to ninth in Division C but four points on the road this week could change the picture dramatically and see Derry enter the play-off places. With Midleton also desperate for points to avoid become marooned at the foot of the table, it will be all to play for in the last game before the Christmas break.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year. Thanks should also go to the local businesses who supported and Irsquod like to encourage residents to visit their local business to support Small Business Saturday. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club.

We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
