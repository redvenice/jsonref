It’s a highly effective, visible deterrent to bike thieves. They know that if they are caught with a registered bike, the owner can be traced and they will be arrested. \u0027Remember to record details of your bike such as the frame number (normally found underneath the bike between the pedals or where the back wheel slots in), the BikeRegister number plus any other distinguishing features, and take a photo.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Unseen LA Gritty images document slice sprawling city 1970s 80s","story":"Share this article \u0027That became the LA Documentary Project.\u0027The city, which was founded in 1781, was approaching the celebration of its bicentennial in 1981 and the project was to commemorate that milestone. Starting in the fall of 1979, Humble began taking photographs. \u0027To tell you the truth, I didn\u0027t go out looking for anything. I didn\u0027t know what I was doing, and I really kind of had to just follow my nose and that\u0027s what I did,\u0027 he recalled.What Humble did know was that he wanted to make images in color.\u0027The reason I stopped using a 35mm camera with black and white was because I had come to the end of the trail,\u0027 he said. \u0027When I was looking at my contact sheets at some point, I realized that I was looking at the same pictures I had made before and so I kind of got to the point where I felt, well, I\u0027m done with this. I need to do something else.\u0027When we got that grant for the LA Documentary Project, I decided to move into the large format camera with color and so rather than walking around on the streets making images very quickly and intuitively, they had to be put together in a very kind of rigorous way.\u0027         Photographer John Humble was drawn to the above image, titled Carson, November 13, 1979, because of \u0027the yellow car matching the yellow house,\u0027 and the residence\u0027s proximity to the transformers in the background. \u0027I have a different aesthetic than a lot of photographers,\u0027 he told DailyMail.com. \u0027To me, LA was a place and is a place where the industrial machine is of great consequence and exists in very close proximity to where people live.\u0027 California\u0027s economy currently ranks fifth in the world, and Humble noted that in 1979 and 1980, the state was producing a lot in Los Angeles          \u0027My pictures are all seen from a moving car and so I drove around Los Angeles, looked out the window and when I would see something I thought might be interesting to be photographed, I would stop and then I would take a look at it,\u0027 Humble told DailyMail.com. \u0027In LA, you pretty much have to have a car. I mean, if you don\u0027t have a car in LA, it\u0027s like being a eunuch in a harem. You\u0027re just stuck, you can get around but it\u0027s not easy.\u0027 Above, an image titled Olympic Boulevard and Ford Boulevard, East Los Angeles, February 8, 1980         For his images, Humble explained that he used cibachrome \u0027because when I started making photographs in color, color was pretty fugitive. And in fact there had been some real scandals about how long color materials lasted.\u0027 He told DailyMail.com that the cibachrome process was one that did not fade easy, but that it was also arduous. During the development process bleach was used to get rid of dye that was already part of the material. \u0027I wore an industrial respirator and long rubber gloves to keep any of that bleach off my skin because if it got on your skin, it would burn you.\u0027 Above, an image titled 3790 Olympic Boulevard, East Los Angeles, February 7, 1980         The above image, titled Pacific Coast Highway at Alameda Street., Wilmington, November 15, 1979, was one of the first photos that Humble took for what would become the LA Documentary Project. Humble also had changed from black and white to color and to a large format camera. \u0027Anything made in... \u002779 is the very first days of me making photographs with that view camera and quite frankly I didn\u0027t know what I was doing with that camera. I mean, you know, it\u0027s a very complicated machine, it doesn\u0027t look like it, but it is with all the different ways you can tilt and swing, with the front and the back,\u0027 he told DailyMail.com. \u0027I was completely self-taught when it comes to using the view camera and color\u0027He switched to a 4x5 camera, which requires a dark cloth, placing inidual pieces of film in its back, and time to set up its tripod. Humble also decided to use cibachrome for developing his large prints.\u0027The cibachrome process is one that does not fade easy,\u0027 he explained, adding that \u0027the material actually already had the layers of dye there\u0027 and that during the development process certain areas of dye were bleached away.While the result is images that were durable and long-lasting, he said the procedure was laborious. \u0027I wore an industrial respirator and long rubber gloves to keep any of that bleach off my skin because if it got on your skin, it would burn you.\u0027The colors in the images beam: the yellow car and house, the bright reds of a billboard advertising the Sands in Las Vegas and in the sign for a topless cabaret, and the green of a car next to a place selling ice.  Often, Humble drove around the city in his Volkswagen van in neighborhoods such as East LA and Wilmington - not Beverly Hills or Brentwood.  In LA, you pretty much have to have a car. I mean, if you don\u0027t have a car in LA, it\u0027s like being a eunuch in a harem \u0027In LA, you pretty much have to have a car. I mean, if you don\u0027t have a car in LA, it\u0027s like being a eunuch in a harem,\u0027 he said. \u0027My pictures are all seen from a moving car and so I drove around Los Angeles, looked out the window and when I would see something I thought might be interesting to be photographed, I would stop and then I would take a look at it.\u0027The top of his van also served as a perch for Humble to take pictures from, giving him a vantage point that was different than standing on the street. \u0027I was able to see things and include things in the photographs that I couldn\u0027t have otherwise seen or included.\u0027 Humble has now lived in Los Angeles for 45 years and continues to chronicle the city – more recently two streets, Vermont and Pico, and its downtown. \u0027Downtown LA has been gentrifying for about the last four or five years at an astonishing rate.\u0027I used to walk up and down a street called Broadway downtown and it was all Latinos and all the stores catered to Latino people. And now when you walk up and down Broadway, it\u0027s yuppies with dogs and the stores have all changed and they\u0027re expensive restaurants and things like that that never existed downtown before.\u0027The images he took for the documentary project are now a testament to places, such as the topless cabaret, that are now gone.Nonetheless, the city continues to offer Humble its photographic gifts.\u0027It still surprises me all the time. And I\u0027ll still drive around the corner of someplace I haven\u0027t been before and see something and go, Oh, my God, that\u0027s incredible. And it\u0027s nothing, you know, something nobody else would look at.\u0027         After the LA Documentary Project finished, Humble continued to chronicle the city he has now lived in for 45 years. He noted that many of places he took pictures of during the late 1970s and early 1980s are now gone or have completely changed, such as the image above titled Downtown Los Angeles from Wall Street., Los Angeles, October 24, 1979. \u0027That was another one where I drove by and I looked at and I thought, Well, there\u0027s nothing there. I mean why would you make a picture of that?\u0027 He said the above street scene is bucolic         Other recent photographic projects that Humble has done include documenting the city\u0027s streets, such as Vermont and Pico, and downtown, which he said \u0027has been gentrifying for about the last four or five years at an astonishing rate. I used to walk up and down a street called Broadway downtown and it was all Latinos and all the stores catered to Latino people. And now when you walk up and down Broadway, it\u0027s yuppies with dogs and the stores have all changed and they\u0027re expensive restaurants and things like that that never existed downtown before.\u0027 Above, an image titled 5304 Figueroa Street, Los Angeles, November 6, 1979         Humble said that he used power lines, as seen above, to break up the sky in images. It was important to him that he showed a city beyond the representation of palm trees and people in fancy cars. \u0027That\u0027s what I wanted to do was to go around to the different parts of LA that people really probably didn\u0027t go into very much or pay much attention to and photograph these things that I thought really were indicative or emblematic of Los Angeles and how we live in Los Angeles – how most people live in Los Angeles.\u0027 Above, an image titled View West from 2700 Block, Guirado Street., East Los Angeles, February 8, 1980         \u0027LA is all about commerce,\u0027 Humble said of the above image titled 349 Rose Avenue, Venice, July 7, 1980. He noted the billboard blaring \u0027It\u0027s Chevy\u0027s Homecoming\u0027 between the two homes. While taking the photo, a woman came out of the salmon-colored house smoking a cigarette. Humble said that he spent a lot of time thinking about philosophy, painting and photography before he took the images for the LA Documentary Project. He said: \u0027They\u0027re pretty edgy pictures in a way\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE James Middleton celebrates healthy profits exploding card firm Boomf","story":"Share this article   Martha Lane Fox has revealed that she would like to have been a Hollywood starlet. The 46-year-old internet entrepreneur, who co-founded late travel deals website lastminute.com in 1998, says: \u0027I\u0027m a frustrated actress and would love to have had a successful Hollywood career like my heroine Hedy Lamarr.Unfortunately, I\u0027m not nearly as racy as Hedy and not a fraction as glamorous.\u0027Lamarr, who died in 2000 aged 85, was almost as famous for her colourful private life — she married six times — as for inventing 1940s technology that led to GPS, wi-fi and Bluetooth.            Luciana Gimenez, 50, has marked the festive season by slipping into a shiny gold leotard and red stockings for a picture, which she shared onlineSir Mick Jagger\u0027s former lover, Brazilian TV host Luciana Gimenez, refuses to let being single spoil Christmas.The 50-year-old mother of the Rolling Stone\u0027s son Lucas, 20, has marked the festive season by slipping into a shiny gold leotard and red stockings for a picture, which she shared online.Last year, she split from her husband, media executive Marcelo de Carvalho, with whom she has an eight-year-old son, Lorenzo.\u0027I am alone and happy,\u0027 she says. \u0027Mick is a wonderful father, just like Marcelo.

So, in 1644, Parliament simply abolished it, declaring it had ‘no warrant in the word of God’.         One Christmas, nearly 400 years ago, Britain woke up and it had goneThey had a point. All these feast days were completely spurious. And the riotous festivities that took place at Christmas had nothing to do with Christ and everything to do with the ancient pagan gods.In the early days of Christianity, the old customs proved remarkably hard to suppress, so in the 6th century, on the principle that if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em, Pope Gregory shrewdly instructed St Augustine to turn the Pagan Winter Solstice festivities into a celebration of Christ’s birthday, with December 25 as the official date.This also lined up Christmas with the Saturnalia, an old Roman festival, when Saturn — the god of plenty, agriculture, wealth, growth and dissolution — was celebrated at a vast outdoor banquet attended by the gentry of Rome.For a week after, schools were on holiday, the law courts were closed, all work was stopped, criminals weren’t executed or even punished, and (unless the enemy insisted on attacking) war was suspended.There was drinking and dancing, and presents of lamps, candles, dolls and evergreen branches were given. Houses, shops and public buildings were ablaze with light.Cross-dressing was encouraged: women as men, men as women, and sometimes people as animals. Slaves were waited on by their masters children, normally seen but not heard, were allowed to take part — they even had a festival of their own, the Juvenilia — and everyone participated in the great dance, the ‘dance of the god’, to bring new life and energy to the flagging world.In the Northern hemisphere, pagans prized evergreens such as holly as symbols of life continuing in the dead of winter the newly Christianised Anglo-Saxons adopted it as an emblem of Christ’s thorns.The Anglo-Saxons were conquered by the Normans in 1066, who coined the word ‘Christ-Masse’, and threw themselves vigorously into the revels. Spread over the Twelve Days of Christmas, these formed the principal annual holiday of the feudal world.Families attended Christmas Day mass, then gorged themselves on roast beef, plum porridge, minced pies, cakes and ale. Next there were plays, followed by non-stop dancing, singing, drinking and the exchanging of presents.On the final day of the celebrations, Twelfth Night, there was a last outburst of indulgence. And all this went on under the approving eyes of the priests.         In 1647, after Charles I had finally been defeated by Parliamentary forces, a pro-Christmas riot in Canterbury resulted in the rioters taking control of the city, pinning up holly and encouraging revelry in the name of ‘God, King Charles, and Kent’Despite the best efforts of the Reformation, that thousand-year-old spirit of Christmas endured.By the start of the 17th century, however, England was changing, and Christmas with it. The feudal structure that underpinned it all was virtually at an end.Central government became more powerful, which drew the nobility to London both Elizabeth I and her successor, the Scottish king James VI (who became King James I of England) felt obliged to send the nobles back home at Christmas to look to the needs of their tenants and revive the old customs.In Ben Jonson’s play Christmas, His Masque, presented at Court in 1616, Father Christmas cries: ‘Why, gentlemen, would you have kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas, Christmas of London, and Captaine Christmas?’The old boy is surrounded wherever he goes by his ten children — Misrule, Carol, Minced Pie, Gambol, Post-and-Pair, New Year’s Gift, Mumming, Wassail, Offering and Baby Cake.Gambols, wassails and baby cake were soon to be in short supply for the Stuart court. Charles I had succeeded his father James I in 1625. As a Catholic sympathiser, he swiftly embarked on a collision course with the increasingly Puritan Parliament.This led, in 1642, to civil war: Parliament versus the Crown. Short of funds, English MPs approached their Scottish counterparts for help, who assisted only on condition that the Church of England would be reformed.Led by Puritan radicals, Parliament agreed, taking the first symbolic steps towards cancelling Christmas — a filthy Catholic invention, they called it, with the ‘trappings of Popery and rags of the Beast’.Christmas Day itself was decreed an ordinary working day, on which shops were legally obliged to remain open.This did not prove popular. In 1643 in London, a mob of apprentices forced shops that had opened to close. But the Puritans persisted with their mission.In January 1645, a new Directory for Public Worship declared Sunday the only holy day no other feast day had ‘warrant in the word of God’, and ministers holding services on any day other than the Sabbath faced imprisonment.The draconian new regime was bitterly resented. In 1646, apprentices in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, rioted the following year on London’s Cornhill, an angry mob physically stopped the Mayor and his men from pulling down the Christmas decorations from a water conduit that revellers had playfully festooned. The protest turned violent one man died of his injuries in Newgate jail. Elsewhere, congregations defiantly held services on Christmas Day.In 1647, after Charles I had finally been defeated by Parliamentary forces, a pro-Christmas riot in Canterbury — which had until then been solid in its support of Parliament — resulted in the rioters taking control of the city, pinning up holly and encouraging revelry in the name of ‘God, King Charles, and Kent’.Charles I was beheaded in 1649, but in 1653 the rumble of pro-Christmas discontent was still sufficiently disquieting for Oliver Cromwell, newly installed as Lord Protector, to enact measures that punished not only ministers who conducted Christmas services, but their congregations as well.It was all in vain nothing could kill the spirit of Christmas. Services were still conducted, carols still carolled, feasts were devoured, gourds were drained and merry-making ran on unbridled — albeit behind closed doors.Cromwell, having taken up residence in the Palace of Whitehall, and briefly toyed with the idea of having himself crowned, soon took to the high life. He liked music, playing bowls and hunting. For his daughter’s wedding he even laid on a lavish feast and entertainment fit for royalty.He died in 1658, after which the great Puritan project stumbled.The monarchy was restored in 1660, and so was Christmas, joyously. In the satirical Poor Robin’s Almanack that year, a homespun versifier wrote:‘Now thanks to God for Charles’ returnWhose absence made old Christmas mournFor then we scarcely did it knowWhether it Christmas were or no.’Despite its jubilant welcome, however, the season was not quite its former self it became increasingly nostalgic and respectable.It was Charles Dickens — a reveller in the great festive carnival tradition — who changed all that. His first novel, The Pickwick Papers, combined the noble spirit of Christmas, of giving and forgiving, with a blissful sense of abandon.This reached its climax in A Christmas Carol, where old Mr Fezziwig, the London businessman to whom the young Ebenezer Scrooge was apprenticed, is a positively Saturnalian figure, dancing himself to a standstill.But it is Sleary, the lisping circus owner in Hard Times, who truly gives Dickens’s last word on the subject: ‘People mutht be amuthed, Thquire, thomehow…they can’t be alwayth a working, nor yet they can’t be alwayth a learning. Make the betht of uth, not the wurtht.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"State schools plan make hundreds thousands recruiting sixth formers China","story":"Share this article Head teacher Desmond Deehan told The Times: \u0027State schools can\u0027t offer tier 4 visas that is open only to private schools and further education colleges.

They also contain an impressive array of phytochemicals, proven to reduce the risk of developing cancerous cells.Turning them to juice is a clever way of getting all the benefits of these little veggies — and winning over sprout-haters. Rinse a small handful of cooked (roasted or boiled) sprouts under cold water and put them in a blender along with 300ml of orange juice, a thumb-sized piece of fresh ginger, half a teaspoon of turmeric and the juice of half a lemon.Whizz until it turns to liquid and taste, adding more of the above ingredients until you’re happy with the flavour. The ginger and turmeric (both superfoods, rich in metabolism-boosting antioxidants) will give it a spicy kick, while the lemon makes it fresh and citrussy.There should be enough for two glasses. Serve chilled, and drink it first thing in the morning — giving you the perfect excuse to indulge for the rest of the day.         If you can’t stomach sprouts for tea, but don’t want them to go to waste, this healthy green juice is for you  WHIP UP BRANDY BUTTER TO HYDRATE YOUR LOCKSButter — especially alcohol-laced butter — may not sound like the most obvious thing to put on your hair, but there are unexpected benefits to lathering it into your locks.It’s full of fatty acids, which lock in moisture from the root to the tip, making hair look thick and silky, and taming frizz or flyaway strands.In small quantities, brandy has also been proven to improve circulation to the scalp and prevent hair loss. Upmarket cosmetics brand Molton Brown even sells a brandy-based bath and shower gel for £24. To turn leftover brandy butter into a hair mask, put two tablespoons in a bowl and add four tablespoons of milk (which makes hair shine), two tablespoons of coconut oil (to nourish the scalp) and two tablespoons of honey (a humectant, meaning it attracts moisture and keeps hair hydrated).Mix well and add a tablespoon each of castor oil (which stimulates hair growth) and glycerine (which stops the mask from drying out). Both are available at health food shops or online (£6 for 250ml).Beat the mixture with a spoon until it forms a paste. Apply to the hair with a comb, section by section, focusing more on the ends. Leave it for half an hour before rinsing off and washing your hair twice with your normal shampoo.         Butter — especially alcohol-laced butter — may not sound like the most obvious thing to put on your hair, but there are unexpected benefits to lathering it into your locks  FREEZE WINE AND FIZZ FOR EXTRA FLAVOURAlcohol is always flowing at this time of year, but if you’ve got open, unwanted bottles of mulled wine or fizz lying around, don’t tip them down the sink.Instead, put the remains to good use — by freezing them in ice-cube trays and using them to flavour stocks, stews and pasta dishes.Mulled wine tastes great in beef or pork-based recipes, while champagne or prosecco can be used to ‘deglaze’ a hot pan (that is, mop up the cooking juices and food particles after browning meat to make gravy). The bubbles will disappear once defrosted, so you can use it like white wine. In summer, you can add frozen cubes to cocktails or sangria to chill drinks without diluting their flavour.Use silicone ice-cube trays rather than plastic, as it makes the cubes easier to press out, and simply pour left-over mulled wine or champagne into the compartments, letting any bubbles disperse and filling each three-quarters full (the liquid will expand as it freezes).Trays with lids are best so the liquid doesn’t get freezer burn. It will take four to five hours to set solid. Then, simply pop out as required and put the rest away for a later date.         Alcohol is always flowing at this time of year, but if you’ve got open, unwanted bottles of mulled wine or fizz lying around, don’t tip them down the sink  SMELL OF CHRISTMAS ALL YEAR ROUND!They may be left over from spicing up the mulled wine or stuck around a wreath on the front door.Once your oranges start to shrivel, though, don’t bin them — use the peel from the fruit to make a seasonal room fragrance.Take two or three large oranges and stud them all over with whole cloves. Then, using a vegetable peeler or sharp knife, peel long strands of skin off the fruit, winding all the way around so the peel is as wide and long as possible.Stretch these out and arrange on a baking sheet covered with greaseproof paper. Bake in a cool oven (90C) for 25 minutes, until they curl up and turn stiff.Allow the peel to cool completely before placing it in bowls around the house, mixing with potpourri or even warming over a tealight for a lovely smell.

The fragile tranquility is broken as the scientists fire up an electric drill and get to work.Led by Wiradjuri man Dr Michael Fletcher, a renowned geographer from the University of Melbourne, the team constructs a pontoon, which they then float to the centre of the billabong. From there, Fletcher and his crew will drill and extract four sediment cores from beneath the still water. Inside these muddy cores are clues about the hidden, potent history of this place stretching back several millennia.“We’re trying to really reimagine Melbourne, as it was prior to British invasion and under Aboriginal management,” Fletcher says.By analysing the sediment – from the traces of pollen, and layers of charcoal and organic matter, to the DNA of lost creatures and micro-organisms – with the local Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders and community, Fletcher will add to the collective knowledge of this secluded spot.This coring exercise is phase one of a research program using scientific and Indigenous knowledge to document remnant billabongs across Melbourne. It’s about “helping Melbourne reconnect to its hidden treasures,” Fletcher says.The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people are the traditional owners of the Bulleen and Heidelberg area, which was connected to Melbourne through the Birrarung river system. The Melbourne area was once so lush with waterways and bushland that palaeontologist and conservationist Tim Flannery likened it to a “temperate Kakadu”.The billabong off Bulleen Road, now bordered by sporting fields, golf courses and roads, was part of a vast system flowing out from the Birrarung – the Yarra river.It’s hard to conjure what has been lost. Where Crown Casino sits today “was a giant swamp”, Fletcher says. “There was a waterfall where Elizabeth Street flows into the Yarra, and where Spencer Street was, there was actually a rock bar across the river.”Yarra “improvement” works in the late 1800s, at the height of the gold-rush expansion of “marvellous Melbourne”, severed the Bolin Bolin billabong and others like it from the river. Natural flooding was interrupting day-to-day life as the city grew, Fletcher says.This billabong is one of five that remain in urban Melbourne. With the rest long since filled in or turned into tips by colonisers, this place is all the more precious, providing an “ecological window into what the billabong system used to look like”, Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elder Uncle Dave Wandin says.Fletcher has studied many similar sites across Australia, and observes that the removal of Aboriginal land management after colonisation led to ecosystems becoming less erse and less healthy.By midday, he has collected the first of four cores, after rowing out to the pontoon with his crew and using a two-metre-long metal stick to push a clear plastic tube deep into the earth beneath the metre-deep water.Back on shore, he holds the long-buried treasure. Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung elders including Wandin and Alice Kolasa, and water and land managers from the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung cultural heritage corporation, join the scientists in the field to discuss the coring and analysis.They focus their attention on the first core. A full laboratory analysis will take about six months and involve high-tech geothermal scanning. But this core already tells the story of the billabong’s post-colonial decline.The top section – containing the most recent sediment – looks more like tar than earth. There’s a distinct change in colour about a third of the way down, from deep, jet black to a lighter, healthier brown.“There’s a definite change from here,” Fletcher says, pointing to the bottom of the tube, “into this really black muck. I think this black muck is going to be post-British kind of pollution. It really stinks, and it’s just yuck.”Wandin is a key fire knowledge holder and helped to develop the Victorian traditional owners’ cultural fire strategy. He hopes the analysis of charcoal within the core will provide clues about traditional Indigenous practices in burning and managing the site. This could inform the use of fire to promote natural regeneration around the billabong, rather than relying on chemicals to control weeds.“I look at a landscape and try and imagine what it was … and that’s going to give me information,” he says. “Hopefully we’ll find out from the charcoal in this the frequency of burning and the type of burning.”Fletcher and Wandin discuss how the area around the billabong has become cluttered with trees and wild undergrowth. They point to one enormous red gum which shows the changes that have played out. It branches outwards, rather than upwards – a sign it grew in a much more open landscape, not among today’s closely grown “mess”, as Wandin describes it.Listening in on this exchange is Delta Lucille Freedman, project manager for the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung corporation, who is conducting a cultural values study of the Bulleen-Banyule Flats area on behalf of the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. What she hears resonates with archival material from Melbourne surveyor Robert Hoddle and pastoral holders, who frequently wrote that this landscape was a thinly wooded grassland. Observations of broader Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung country indicate it was burnt in the warmer months.The grasses are now pasture grasses rather than native ones, which has an impact on insect health. If the seeds of the old vegetation can be sourced, significant replanting could be undertaken by the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung Narrap rangers, an Indigenous land management team.“From an anthropological perspective, it was not a natural landscape but a cultural landscape that was shaped over millennia by Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung beliefs, traditions and land management,” she says.Back in 1840, in the early days of colonisation, Woi Wurrung people made a request to the Port Phillip Aboriginal protectorate for a permanent reserve to be established in this area. Because non-Indigenous settlers were already on the land, Nerre Nerre Warren reserve was chosen instead, but the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung continued to live in the area and practiced their traditions on this land until they were moved onto Acheron Station in 1859.“When we were kicked out, we weren’t allowed to go back down into the city,” Wandin says. “This is sort of the closest where we felt comfortable, where we weren’t really interfering.” The Bolin Bolin billabong was an important area for ceremonies and dances involving neighbouring clans, a gathering place, and had an ecosystem that could support between 300 and 500 people, he says. The Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people would have fished for eels by burning the reeds in the still water here, knowing they would congregate in the warm shallows. They could then be fished with a spear.“It’s like a day spa for an eel,” Wandin jokes. They would have come here to shed fat and then migrated north in their epic journey to the saltwater of the Coral Sea to breed. In running water, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung would have used stone eel traps, a common practice across Victorian Aboriginal groups.“It looks beautiful, it looks nice and green – but it’s not its natural landscape,” Wandin says. “But it doesn’t mean we just leave it alone and do nothing.“We call it caring for country today, but it’s caring for our mother … she nurtured us, she nurtured our ancestors and she’ll continue to nurture us if we look after her in the way that she’s been looked after for tens of thousands of years.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

Or so it seems. It’s been described in medical terms, as an epidemic, plague and infection. It has its own minister in the UK, Baroness Barran, with indications that other countries – Switzerland, Germany, maybe even the US – may follow suit.The problem is that loneliness is seldom defined. It’s often presented as an inidual, even universal, mental affliction. But loneliness is relatively new. The word comes into common usage around 1800, linked to social change – especially the secularity, alienation and competition produced by modernity. Before then it was solitude that interested writers and philosophers. Solitude could be problematic, but in a landscape forged by God, was one ever alone?Loneliness is different at different times. Yes, it can be desperate and crushing and agonising. But it can also be temporary, transitory, a “pinch-point” or life stage. Loneliness is not a single emotion but a mix of different feelings, including anger, resentment and fear as well as sorrow, grief and shame. It can even be pleasurable.As a historian of emotion, these complexities, and the absence of any existing extended historical inquiry, inspired my new book, A Biography of Loneliness. With case studies that include Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria and Thomas Turner, it explores the emergence of loneliness as a modern, physical and psychological affliction. And it considers the role played by political, social and economic factors (including the fact that the loneliest of all – homeless people and refugees – are not covered by the paper-thin umbrella of government concern).I chose these 10 books for what they have to say inidually, as well as what they represent collectively, about the historically changing meanings of loneliness. Many are written by women, because the connections between loneliness, creativity and gender are a neglected but critical aspect of modern and contemporary writing.1. Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1719)Drenched in the contemporaneous racism of crusaders and cannibals, Robinson Crusoe is often read as a study in religious redemption and a search for the self. Unlike Tom Hanks’s character in the Crusoe-inspired film Castaway (2000), Crusoe is not lonely. The word is never mentioned and he may rail at God, but the universe he inhabits has certainty and meaning.2. Frankenstein by Mary Shelley (1818)This well-known tale (by a writer still, depressingly often, dismissed as “Shelley’s wife”) is one of the first fictive attempts to identify loneliness and social disconnect. Written when science was being “mastered”, and drawing on concerns about social alienation and the exploitation of nature, Frankenstein was also written when the word loneliness was just emerging. It contains just two references to loneliness (and one of those is a lonely road, reflecting its unemotional origin as a synonym for solitude). Yet the angst of Frankenstein’s monster, guilty of sin, abandoned and lost, expresses a remarkably familiar, modern version of loneliness.3. The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall (1928)One of the earliest, best-known accounts of lesbian experience in British and American culture, this novel raises important questions about gender, sexuality, and “belonging” broadly defined. Though its language of “sexual inversion” and “inverts” is archaic, the novel brought attention to the core themes of loneliness and alienation that resulted from early 20th-century anti-gay rhetoric. A recurring theme of LGBTQ+ discussions in the 21st century has been loneliness, especially when linked to mental illness and minority stress.4. A Writer’s Diary by Virginia Woolf (1953)By the 1940s, when “loneliness” was in widespread use to mean emotional isolation, Woolf wrote of its uses. For how else, other than through loneliness, could she disconnect from the world? Published posthumously by her husband Leonard, the book comprises extracts from the diaries she kept from 1918 until 1941, the year she died by suicide. It is filled with fascinating detail on her writing life and the Bloomsbury set of which she was part, as well as critical reflections on loneliness in a gendered world.5. The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath (first published in 1963 under the pseudonym Victoria Lucas)Plath’s novel explores a loneliness that again stemmed from social expectation – this time, what it was to be a woman in the 1950s, juggling the expectations of work, domesticity and desire. The agonising loneliness and mental illness described by its narrator Esther Greenwood connect to Plath’s own life, as described in her journals and letters. Plath killed herself just one month after its publication.6. Journal of a Solitude by May Sarton (1973)An American poet and writer, Sarton wrote this book in order to record her experiences of depression and loneliness. The Journal was widely regarded as a landmark in women’s autobiography. Like Woolf, Sarton wrote about loneliness as necessary for creativity. But her writing also echoes Romantic ideas about the creator being in nature, and the need for physical connectedness to the world in order to belong.7. Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection by John T Cacioppo and William Patrick (2009)In the early 21st century, loneliness began to be a medical as well as a social concern. In light of an ageing population, with health risks attached to loneliness, post-industrial societies needed to look at causes. Together with his wife Stephanie, the late John Cacioppo (et al) undertook path-breaking work in the neuroscience of loneliness. This book was one of the first to describe loneliness as a form of contagion it gives a neuroscientific explanation for the physical damage caused by social isolation, from hearts and neurons to the immune system.8. The Lonely City by Olivia Laing (2016)Laing explores the paradox of loneliness in the city – multitudes of others alongside an “omnipresent, unanswerable feeling that I was in a state of lack”. She also considers the sense of blame attached (which reminds me of the dismissal of lonely people in the UK as “Billy no-mates”, as though they are lonely for a reason). Loneliness can bring creativity, too, Laing reminds us, via a (strikingly male) lineup of artists that includes Edward Hopper, Edward Darger and Andy Warhol.9. Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman (2017)The winner of the 2017 Costa first novel award, this book focuses on the eponymous social misfit, who is isolated and lonely. An abusive childhood, facial scarring and her social awkwardness contribute to her sense of being misunderstood. When asked how she is, she always replies: “Absolutely fine.” It is only when she befriends Raymond, or is befriended by him, that she begins to understand how to have a friend, and to belong.10. Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari (2018)Hari’s book is a reminder of how devastating loneliness can be, despite all its creative possibilities. This is an important study of depression as a social problem, against a backdrop of medical reductionism: depression as a problem of mind (or rather, brain). It is unmet need that Hari sees at the centre of rising levels of depression and anxiety. We are back to Cacioppo’s need for social connections – with Hari’s conclusion that their loss, as the book’s subtitle suggests, is the real cause of depression.• A Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion by Fay Bound Alberti is published by Oxford University Press.

The order in which eligible males would be conscripted to fight in the Vietnam war was decided by random picking of capsules containing all 366 possible birthdays (the army had spotted the loophole through which leap year men might have escaped).In the bravura opening scene of Richard Russo’s ninth novel, three 19-year-olds at a Connecticut arts college watch a tiny black-and-white TV in December 1969, as the first draft ballot unfolds. What steady Lincoln Moser, arty Teddy Novak and rock music-obsessed Mickey Girardi see will shape their fates.Readers know from the outset that none of the trio died in ’Nam, as the lottery scene is a flashback from the summer of 2015, when the men, now 66 and burdened with medical and financial urgencies, reunite for a weekend at a Cape Cod holiday home belonging to Lincoln’s family.Their survival, though, is the point. Russo, born in 1949, dedicates this book to all those listed on the Vietnam Veterans memorial, and the story feels informed by a strong sense of fortune in having his name on dust-jackets rather than the long granite wall of mourning in Washington DC. The heroes’ professions of real estate, academic publishing and sound engineering – sketched in with small but resonant details – might be thought boring in ordinary times, but for their generation represent a glorious escape. Russo’s subject is the guilt and responsibility of having fallen on the better side of fate.From its title (taken from a 1950s hit single by Johnny Mathis) through recurrent references to “luck”, Chances Are examines the balance between decision and destiny, choice and providence. Lincoln, Teddy and Mickey went to their college because they failed to get the grades for fancier campuses, and became friends when they all happened to take jobs as waiters at a snooty sorority house.While students they also all have the bad luck to be drawn to the same young woman, Jacy Calloway. Her tragic misfortune is to go missing, in 1971, during a summer weekend at the Martha’s Vineyard house with the three buddies, each of whom hopes to have a chance with her.Russo is known for novels about babyboomer blue-collar men, such as 1993’s Nobody’s Fool and the Pulitzer prize-winning Empire Falls in 2001. His stories are omnisciently narrated in a tone of sardonic understanding of human folly, which places him in the house of American style on a polished mezzanine between the poetic complexity of John Updike and the gentler observation of Anne Tyler. The smart, fast chat among his characters, meanwhile, reflects Russo’s parallel career as a screenwriter.The central presence of a police chief in 2016’s Everybody’s Fool, which 23 years after Nobody’s Fool was also the author’s first formal sequel, suggested an engagement with fiction publishing’s hungry demand for sequences and suspense. In featuring the cold case of Jacy’s disappearance, Chances Are includes an antagonist of the sort known, since Gillian Flynn’s 2012 super-seller, as a “gone girl”. Following the rules of the genre, by page 60 Russo introduces a juicy suspect who is surely too obvious to be the perpetrator, and also deftly accommodates a retired detective, a mysterious postcard and an ominous reference to the island’s landfill site.However, around the shivers and guilts of a missing person story, Russo ultimately remains loyal to his previous mission to represent realistically the textures of average lives. The impeccably delayed revelation of what happened to Jacy is satisfying, but more Russo than Ian Rankin. The gone girl turns out to have been caught in the novel’s twin undercurrents of Vietnam and the hands people are dealt: she has been very unlucky, but in a way that few will guess.Though the solutions lie in the 1969 and 1971 insets, the main time frame of September 2015 is politically timely. Barack Obama must leave the White House in 16 months’ time, and even the Democrats among Russo’s men can’t bring themselves to vote for Hillary Clinton as his successor. The Obamas and Clintons summered on Martha’s Vineyard, but as the election approaches “Trump for President” signs are going up on the island, though even Lincoln, a Republican, is sure the outsider has no chance.Russo’s acute novels will help historians to understand how Trump, who had a medical deferment from Vietnam, garnered support among those unable to vacation on Cape Cod. Chances Are, a rare mix of the tense and tender, should gain Russo further literary acclaim.• Chances Are is published by Allen \u0026amp Unwin (RRP £15.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

All these themes and more are woven into a glorious tapestry of literary enthusiasms. Brenda Lozano is among several contemporary Mexican writers whose playfully innovative work has met with acclaim in the UK. And Other Stories publishes Yuri Herrera and Cristina Rivera Garza Granta and 4th Estate have been publishing the unclassifiable Mexican-American novels of Booker-longlisted Valeria Luiselli. Let’s hope more of Lozano’s work will follow.In Spanish the novel’s title was Cuaderno Ideal: “Ideal Notebook”. In form and in looping, oblique and fragmentary content, it’s a journal kept by the 30-year old narrator while her boyfriend, Jonás, is across the Atlantic in Spain. Just before they got together, Jonás’s Madrid-born mother had died this trip is a family pilgrimage of sorts. She wonders if their love might be his way of coping with grief, then if she should have made more space for that grief in their lives: “Jonás has a photo of his mother in the study we share … Jonás wanted to put it in the bedroom, and I suggested putting it in the study. “Help me choose a place for it in the study,” Jonás said.” Now I wonder if we should have put the photo of his mother in the bedroom.”The apartment they share is a small one in Mexico City, with paper-thin walls, but their bed, “the site of domestic ambivalence”, is compared to the famous bed of Penelope and Odysseus, carved from a living tree. In a delicious stroke of self-irony, she names their cat Telemachus. The notebook is her equivalent of Penelope’s loom in it she weaves and unravels ideas until Jonás’s return, getting all her news of the outside world and her music through the wall from her neighbour’s TV and stereo. “Wait. I love this song. The neighbour has such good taste. It’s true, writing is more like unravelling than weaving. Unravelling involves having woven something already and there’s always so much to unravel.”The narrator loves books, all kinds of books (“Oh it’s wonderful when one book leads you to another”), and one of her principal themes is how therapeutic literature can be: “The genre people call self-help literature sounds tautological to me I read all literature as self-help.” She’s in slow recovery from a terrible accident, the nature of which we never discover, only that death was imminent, it left scars, and that she met Jonás on the day she felt well enough to go out for a walk and buy a sorbet. “Nobody knew if I was going to wake up. I didn’t know either. The first thing I heard when I did wake up was one of the nurses singing a Shakira song … This can’t be death, I thought. I knew I’d come back. Back to life. Back to life and its magnificent vulgarity.” The notebook is more than just her way of coping with her lover’s absence – it heals. Loop reads like a confessional essay rather than fiction, and like Luiselli’s first novel Faces in the Crowd, it plays with the idea of keeping readers guessing whether it conjures an entirely imaginative world, or represents a kind of autofiction. In the latter, Luiselli tells us that each night her narrator’s husband sneaks glances at her novel in progress. “It’s all fiction, I tell him, but he doesn’t believe me.” Loop offers the same kind of clandestine pleasure, and the same attitude to blurring the truth Lozano wants the book to feel like coming upon a diary. Its cryptic swivels from one subject to another and its loose, allusive structure give the illusion that it has been thrown together, but the result is far more artful than that.Halfway through the narrator imagines how the novel might end, on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico: “If this notebook had an ideal ending it would be a trip to the beach with Jonás. In the final lines I’d turn into a swallow, everything I’ve written would turn into a song and the notebook itself would take flight. Feathers would begin to sprout from Jonás’s arms, his feet would gradually leave the sand and he’d start to fly.” But life, she knows, isn’t like that the book will end instead on the day Jonás returns from Spain. It will meditate not on the transformation of the narrator and her lover into birds, but on the multiple transformations of story she’s effected across the loom of these pages, and in the minds of us, her fortunate readers.• Gavin Francis’s Island Dreams: Mapping an Obsession is out next May.

More than £1bn is likely to be spent digitally on Christmas Day according to the Centre for Retail Research.IMRG, the online retailers’ body, said Christmas Day was not only about picking up bargains using vouchers and cash received as a gift. “Gifting companies say there is a massive spike in buying an experience, like a hotel break or driving a car, on Christmas morning as people forget to buy a present for people and those gifts are instant.”But for some, Boxing Day remains an opportunity to treat themselves after the hectic buildup is over. “It is like an oasis after the mayhem and pressure of buying presents for other people,” said Wehrle. “You can go shopping for a few hours and have something to eat or go to the cinema. I think it’s less about standing in a queue waiting for a department store to open so you can grab a bargain.”While many retailers have been offering discounts for months, household names such as Next, John Lewis, Harrods and Selfridges tend to hold back until Boxing Day or the 27th, creating events that can still draw a crowd.The property firm Intu said it expected more than 1 million people to flock to its shopping centres, which include Lakeside in Essex and the centre in Gateshead, on Boxing Day.Its commercial director, Trevor Pereira, said: “We expect it to be one of our busiest shopping days of the year.

You see, I was brought up as a Jehovah’s Witness and believed I would die in 1976 when Armageddon came. I would never reach 30, 40 or 50 so I thought. So each birthday has been a shaken fist at the heavens well as a celebration.My 21st lasted three days: drink, drugs, dance and a very long sleep. I came to and felt I’d finally put the cruel denials to bed and maybe that a three-day party would last me a lifetime. But I had a party for my 30th, 40th and 50th. OK, not three days long but a bit of a bash that welcomed in the next decade. So far, so good. And next year I will be 60. I thought the prospect would feel the same. That I would sashay up to the date, throw my arms out and say “welcome” as I had to all the others. But this one feels different.I’ve been getting away with the term “middle age” since I turned 40. I assumed it started around then and ended at 55. Then I got to 55. I extended it, obviously. But it has to end. Next year, I can’t be middle aged any more. I must officially be old.I think of the other 60-year-olds I have known. My mother – worn down by housework and an unhappy marriage, frightened into righteousness by an oppressive religion – was definitely old at 60 and my father was dead at 68. Aunts and uncles and teachers and people I worked for were impossibly ancient at 60, they dressed in beige and had Velcro shoes and all seemed to smell of Vicks VapoRub. I know I will never be like that. But as it gets nearer I realise I will be entering into another realm, old age, the other tick box that is 59-plus. There’s never anything after 59, you are lumped in with the 70- and 80-year-olds as though we all think the same despite a possible 30-year age gap between us.At 60 I will be sent (my older sister assures me) a free bowel cancer check kit complete with a mini scoop to stick in your shit and send off in the post. I will get free prescriptions and eye tests. I think I get reduced admission to my local gym and a rail travel discount card. So even if you are unwilling to accept 60 and bury your head in the sand even if, like me, you are determined to see it as just another number, the world conspires to tell you that things have changed. And at least for me, they have.My 50s have been wonderful. I’ve become single and have had some great dates. I’m open to a new relationship, to flirting, to being wanted and sexual and expansive. I’ve found professional success writing books and essays, editing, teaching and encouraging other writers. I have used my voice to say what I think on behalf of working-class writers and marginalised people, and I’ve discovered in the Fuck-it Fifties that I truly do love myself with no apology or codicil. I have stopped looking for universal approval, worrying about fitting in and whether or not I wear, eat, read or say the right thing. But all that has come at a cost. I’ve been told I appear self-contained and intimidating, “fierce” is a word often used to describe me, all of which I find baffling.Far from being just another decade, I think 60 might be a turning point. Yes, I will flip from middle age to old age, but I may also flip from the Fuck-it Fifties to the Savour-it Sixties. Will I slow down? Will I soften round the edges? I have noticed I am already consolidating important friendships and sloughing off those that have become negative or “taking”, which is the only word I can think of to describe them. I hope to always be making new friends, and in my 60s there may be more time for that.There is, of course, the inevitable express train of time, hurtling away from you as you age. As 60 approaches, I do have the sense of time running out, or at the very least becoming more precious, which is the most cliched of all cliches but nevertheless true. I thought coming up to 60 would feel like just another birthday, but as it approaches I realise I was wrong. It does feel like something is about to end, and so, of course, something is about to begin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d95fdf64300c1f0c4ba346089d1b2b819c7cfe9c/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6096a045fb1478db0acd94a7ed48468","title":"new little women greta gerwig inspirational","story":"My sister-in-law confesses that she is nervous about the Greta Gerwig adaptation of Little Women, in cinemas from Boxing Day. In her family of women, the 1994 film starring Winona Ryder is a Christmas tradition another version will, she fears, inevitably disappoint. Having just seen the new film, starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen as the sisters Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March, I assured her there was nothing to worry about. The rave reviews are pouring in, and to the universal acclaim I can add my own: this clever, spirited, witty adaptation is pure pleasure from start to finish. Furthermore, it serves as a timely reminder of just how feminist the original novel, published in two parts in 1868 and 1869, was.“When I read it at 30 I couldn’t believe it, I felt like I’d never read it before,” Gerwig told the New Yorker. “I couldn’t believe how modern it was, how strange it was, how spiky it was. I’d allowed it to become this snowglobe of sweetness, and it was nothing like that. It was much more complicated.”Lines that Gerwig has used from the original novel include the girls’ mother Marmee’s “I’m angry almost every day of my life” (of course she was, Gerwig has noted: she was a woman in the 19th century) and aspiring painter Amy’s insistence: “I want to be great or nothing.” Little Women is, essentially, a story about raising intelligent, ambitious, creative girls at a time when society consistently undervalued them, a fact to which the title specifically alludes. Heroine Jo desperately wants to be a writer but is under pressure to marry and improve her family’s fortunes. “Women have minds and souls as well as hearts, ambition and talent as well as just beauty, and I’m sick of being told that love is all a woman is fit for,” Jo says in the film.It is ironic, then, that despite having produced one of the best films of the year, Gerwig has been snubbed for her efforts, dismaying many film critics. She was not nominated for a Golden Globe in the best director category, which this year, yet again, features only men. Nor was she shortlisted for best screenplay, despite having intelligently rewritten the story as a non-chronological dual narrative that switches between the sisters’ girlhoods and womanhoods, before she introduces a third narrative strain that erodes the boundaries between fact and fiction while commenting shrewdly on itself.Look away if you don’t want spoilers, but Gerwig gives Jo a book. Alcott’s novel ends with Jo, having got married and become a mother, giving up writing and founding a school. In real life, Alcott became a famous author, writing later of her heroine Jo that “she should have become a literary spinster”. Gerwig blended the two narratives to create a sort of meta-fiction, gifting Alcott’s heroine the ending that she – and perhaps Alcott – were both prevented from writing (in the film, Jo is told by her publisher, in a guise that could equally be that of a Hollywood mogul, that “if the main character’s a girl make sure she’s married by the end”).Perhaps it is Gerwig’s affinity with the March sisters, via the struggle to be a woman artist, that makes her adaptation of Little Women so good. Gerwig’s partner, Noah Baumbach, is also a director, and although their work together has involved collaboration and Baumbach has been vocal about her influence on his work, she has been consistently cast as his muse. Furthermore, Little Women gets to the heart of which stories continue to be perceived as important and worthy of intellectual inquiry and interpretation. This is why I sense that Gerwig may have anticipated the snub, and may even have baked its underpinnings into the text of the film. “It’s just about our little life,” says Jo, of the new writing she is producing. “Who will be interested in a story of domestic struggles and joys? It doesn’t have any real importance.”“Maybe,” says her sister Amy, “We don’t see these things as important because people don’t write about them.”We have come some way to reconciling the domestic when it comes to artistic and literary output, of accepting that stories in such a setting are human stories worthy of being told, even if the protagonists are female. (Because, while women are constantly required to imagine themselves from the viewpoint of a male character, men are rarely expected to surrender the default, and even when they are encouraged to do so will often be resistant.) We have writers such as Elena Ferrante to thank for this ever-increasing acceptance, though we must remember those who dispiritingly insisted that this anonymous author of world-class skill must be a man masquerading as a woman.Women’s stories continue to be written off, to be denied the status of high art. Gerwig knows it, just as any woman who writes novels, or makes art or directs films knows it. Like Jo, you have to fight hard for recognition. I have no doubt that many men will refuse to go and see this film, but those who do, or who are press-ganged into it by excited daughters, will find it brimming with humanity. It is hard not to be moved by the “little women’s” ongoing struggle to be included in that category, or by the thought of all the little girls who will see it, this book I have loved since I was six and which has been reinvented for a new generation, that tells them: “What you want is valid and important.”I don’t know when my sister-in-law will get a chance now: she has just given birth to a daughter. No doubt one day they will watch it together, and it will show her that her dreams and ambitions can be greater and more soaring than Louisa May Alcott, trapped in the 19th century and kicking against it, could ever have hoped."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2103e0a89a11505caddbbc99e26337ad68419a3/0_0_5770_3464/master/5770.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5f407ec402370307b7974dfa8dfbd37","title":"the guardian view on the rise of christian nativist populists a troubling sign of things to come","story":"Over the holiday period the ’s leader column examines the challenges of the future by fathoming out the present. Today we look at the struggle for the soul of ChristianityIt has therefore, for many Christians, been depressing to witness the faith of their churches being used to justify the abandonment of such principles in Europe, Donald Trump’s America and beyond. For liberally minded Christians, 2019 was the latest in a succession of anni horribiles, during which a cultural appropriation of their religion did service for aggressive nationalism, xenophobia, homophobia and anti-environmentalism.In Poland, the Law and Justice party was re-elected, with the enthusiastic backing of the country’s Catholic establishment. It made the demonisation of LGBT people a key part of the autumn election campaign. In doing so it received the active assistance of the archbishop of Kraków, Marek Jędraszewski, who warned voters that a “rainbow plague” had replaced the “red plague” which blighted the country in the communist era. The country also stands accused of breaking European Union law by refusing to comply with a refugee quota programme, instituted in 2015.A question of faithHungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has forsaken talk of illiberal democracy and now speaks of “Christian liberty”. Mr Orbán’s ambition appears to be to turn Budapest into the capital of rightwing Christian thought, an arch-conservative counterpoint to Pope Francis’s Vatican. Last month, at a conference convened in the Hungarian capital to highlight the persecution of Christians in places such as Iraq, Syria and Nigeria, Mr Orbán repeated his argument that Christian culture was under threat from Muslim migration, and warned that the persecution of Christians in Europe was “much closer” than generally understood. The Hungarian Helsinki Committee, a human rights organisation, has accused Mr Orbán of systematically denying food to failed asylum seekers held in detention camps on Hungary’s border – an action it described as “an unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe.” He has also made homelessness a criminal offence.Mr Orbán discovered a religious side in his 30s, as the political party he led, Fidesz, moved to the right. In Italy, the leader of the League party, Matteo Salvini, uses Christianity to pursue culture wars relating to migration and national identity. When Mr Salvini, as minister of the interior in Italy’s previous government, proposed in 2018 that crucifixes should be displayed in all Italian public spaces, including ports he had closed to vessels carrying rescued migrants, he was reprimanded by a close adviser of Pope Francis. The Rev Antonio Spadaro tweeted: “The cross is a sign of protest against sin, violence, injustice and death. It is NEVER a sign of identity. It screams of love to the enemy and unconditional welcome.” But Mr Salvini has since doubled down on his politicisation of Catholic symbols, claiming he is “the last of the good Christians”. Support for him among practising Catholics is high.The battle to defend the rights and human dignity of all, irrespective of gender, race or sexuality, is having to be fought all over again. But the theological roots of that liberal vision in a Pauline notion of universality – “all are one in Christ” – is rarely examined by progressives. In an era when Christian ethics are being so brazenly twisted to serve nativism and attacks on minorities, that could be a mistake. Happily, there are signs that this may change in 2020. Some of the Democrat candidates in next year’s US presidential race are wearing their faith on their sleeve to an unusual extent.Straws in the wind? For both secular liberals and Christians, there are lessons to be drawn from what might be seen as a prophetic alliance between Pope Francis and Greta Thunberg on the most urgent issue facing the world: the climate emergency. When Time magazine made Ms Thunberg its person of the year, the Vatican was quick to celebrate her as “a witness to what the church teaches on the care of the environment and the care of the person”.The pope has identified the protection of the Amazon rainforest, where this year the greatest levels of deforestation for a decade were recorded, as an environmental priority. But the culture wars being fought in the public square – which have seen Ms Thunberg become a target – are also being played out within the Christian churches. A three-week Rome synod on the Amazon in October was overshadowed by conservative criticism of the Pope’s decision to invite native peoples and welcome their religious symbols. Liberal democracies rightly prize the separation of church and state which emerged following the Enlightenment. But as the reactionary right denigrates ideas of human dignity and equality that can be traced back to the first formulations of early Christianity, liberals of goodwill need to unite across the religioussecular ide in 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eeae6c07ca636ac4898e37b867cb570a1b84123b/0_173_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3678d206762e39295087421397b6ee4a","title":"anonymous confessions google form","story":"It was my friend Chris who started me off.

They have 10 more years of habitable planet than the baby I am carrying.In early summer of the same year, after a miscarriage, I find myself pregnant again in the week that megafires tear through the state. There are 70-metre flames producing their own weather systems, driving them further on across the countryside, through the bushland that relies on fire to stimulate new life, on to forests that have never before burnt.The sky over our Canberra home is tinged orange, the air is thick and sticks in the back of your throat in such a way that no coughing seems to dislodge the sensation. The whole country is suffocating. We haven’t seen the sky in a month.Outside, the particle count is only 200 PM2.5 today. Yesterday it was 700, more than double the highest warning of “hazardous”. Two months ago we’d never looked at fine particle readings. We didn’t know the difference between a 10-micrometre particle that can be filtered out by your respiratory system, and one smaller than 2.5 micrometres, that will find its way right into your bloodstream.I wonder if my child will ever have the innocence I had two months ago, of not having to think about whether the air will kill you.Locked in my house, waiting for a high-grade pollution mask to arrive by post, I press my nose up against the glass doors, looking at where my front fence should be. “So this is what it’s like to have a baby at the end of the world.”There’s always a leap of faith in choosing to have a child. Will they be healthy? Can you provide for them? Will you be a good parent? Will you even know how to be a parent? We have to suspend our own disbelief in ourselves. We Can Do This. I Can Do This.There are times in history where that leap has been more existential.I can only imagine that women anxiously questioned “What world will be left for my child?” during the cold war. During epidemics. During genocide. And I presume they continued because, despite the terror, they still had hope. Hope that the atrocities of humanity, the threat of disease, would quiet. Hope that their child would be one of the lucky ones.How different is this existential leap to the one women must take now? To quiet their minds as the world burns? In some ways the threat is both more abstract and more overwhelming.War is an immediate threat to life. But war can stop as abruptly as it starts.Climate collapse is less immediate – there is, at least presently and for most of us, no imminent loss of life. But, unlike war, it cannot be stopped. Perhaps it can be slowed. Maybe a little of the damage already done could be mitigated. But as my climate researcher friend explained to me this year: “There’s an analogy we use to explain climate change to students. We say: it’s like traffic. You’re not in traffic, you are traffic.”I lost two babies in 2019. With each loss, I both grieved and felt something lift from my chest. “What is that lifting?” I searched. “Why is there the smallest touch of relief each time this happens?” I dug.Guilt was the answer. It was guilt sitting on my chest while I was pregnant, that sits there now while I write – pregnant again.Guilt for creating another human that has to live on this planet. Guilt for my unborn child that they will not live the kind of comfortable life that I have. That the things that we know we can pass on to protect our children from suffering, that previous generations have sought to pass on, will do little. Education, wisdom, wealth are useless when there is no air.When I expressed this guilt, or rather its dispersion, after I lost babies friends would say, “Don’t feel climate guilt. We need a smart, informed generation if we’re going to get out of this.” Or, “It’s kids like yours, like mine, that are going to change things.” In these comments I see the hope they are reaching for, the way they quiet their mind when they worry “what world will be left for my child?” as countless women before them have.I envy them that hope. Maybe, it will become the straw I too cling to when I finally do bring a child into this world. I nod as they talk – perhaps more to themselves than to me – and stop words leaving my lips: “Thinking your child will be part of the solution, not the problem, is hubris.” We are the collapse. Our children are the collapse.Why, you might ask, if I think “my child could be part of the solution” is merely self-soothing hubris, do I keep getting pregnant? Why if I have no hope like my friends am I so determined that I’ve now become pregnant for the third time in a year?There are two answers to this. One is that I hope the hope will come.The other is that in choosing between the sadness of living a childfree existence because I do not believe the Earth can survive us, and the sadness of having a child whose future may be limited – I choose the latter. When I weigh them up, hold each in my mind and my hands and see which is heavier, I decide time and again that the latter is a sadness I can more easily carry.I think of my child, of the relationship I will have with them and the world we will live in, like the time my mother was terminally ill.When my mother had cancer there was 12 months between her diagnosis and her death. I knew she would die. But knowing that didn’t mean I didn’t spend time with her. Didn’t laugh with her. Find joy and beauty in our relationship. Enjoy the experiences we could have, while we had time. And so it is, we must reach for the pieces of beauty the world still offers us. The clear blue sky when we have it. A child watching a bee feeding in the garden. The sounds of a flock of native birds passing overhead. We, my child-to-be and I, will visit the world on its deathbed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8239ae962365befe614538d750fc0601c700af83/0_53_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5206790161e5a210cfb544747d3d8b01","title":"my love letter to britain family ties","story":"Since I went to a British school, you have always been part of me.

Britain was always there. As part of me. Being in one of your schools made me more Dutch than before. Because there is no better way to be made aware of your own culture than by being immersed in another. And at the same time, that immersion leaves traces. What you inhale and absorb remains: as an extra layer, a sediment that partly merged with what was already there and partly remains distinguishable and unique.I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I’m like an old lover. I know your strengths and weaknesses. I know you can be generous but also miserly. I know you believe yourself to be unique and different. And of course you are in many ways, but perhaps less than you think. You will never stop referring to the rest of us as “the continent”. It helps you to create the distance you think you need. But it also prevents you from seeing that we all need a bit of distance between us. All European nations are unique. Our differences are a source of admiration, surprise, discomfort, misunderstanding, ridicule, caricature and, yes, love.In the best of times these differences make us the most creative, productive, peaceful and prosperous of families. In the worst of times our differences are manipulated to instil fear, to propagate superiority, to set one family member against the other. Things then quickly get out of hand. We all are also very, very good at that. That is our legacy. That too is who we are. And as a family we have a duty to promote the best of times and keep the worst of times at bay. So far, for all its faults, the EU has been the most successful tool to achieve that goal.You have decided to leave. It breaks my heart, but I respect that decision. You were in two minds about it, like you have always been in two minds about the EU. I wish you had stuck to that attitude, it served you well and it kept all of us in better shape. Was it necessary to force the issue? Not at all. But you did. And the sad thing is, I see it is hurting you. Because the two minds will still be there, even after you have left. In the process so much unnecessary damage has been done to you, and all of us. And I fear more will follow.Truth be told, I felt deeply hurt when you decided to leave.

He spoke something every academic has thought at one point or another: “The university would be a vastly improved place if we simply got rid of all these students!”His focus on his own research goals was so intense that he’d managed the ultimate moral solipsism: he’d reduced other people to mere burdens – intrusions on an otherwise blissful life.I’ve been thinking about that professor a lot while observing the latest piece of relational etiquette advice doing the rounds on Twitter: seeking consent before burdening a friend with emotionally heavy questions, stories or requests for advice.The conversation began when Melissa Fabello, a writer and doctor of human sexuality, shared a text she’d received from a friend. The text read: “Do you have the emotionalmental capacity for me to vent about something medicalweight related for a few minutes?”First, as many people pointed out, being available for a friend is not what the term “emotional labour” usually describes. The term is usually used to talk about the care work that women in the workforce are expected to undertake alongside their formal duties. Think about the hairdresser who acts as a sounding board for advice, or the flight hostess who has to deal with the emotional immaturity of every drunk idiot they’ve encountered. That’s a very different thing to expressing care and concern for a friend, even when it’s inconvenient or burdensome.However, the broader question – should we be obliged to ask before seeking someone’s advice, and can good friendship also include saying no to offering support – still generated a range of responses. Some extended the need for consent into other spaces. For instance, feminist writer Suzannah Weiss proposed that people seek consent before sexting. Like Fabello, Weiss offered a script for seeking consent for sexting.When I first encountered this trend, I found it not only ridiculous but morally troubling. Like the professor who had transformed other people into inconveniences, the idea that someone would erect such strict social boundaries around themselves reeked to me of the kind of inidualism and selfishness that has crippled our ability for collective action as a society.How, I wondered, can we be a society that cares for each other if we can’t go out of our way to be available for them when they need us? If our community comprises only people who can inconvenience me only to the extent that I’m OK with, to what extent can we claim to be a community at all?Moreover, the development of scripts, templates and consent prompts seems to flatten out the need to be responsive to the other person and their needs. Presumably, if we’re close enough to someone to tell them our deepest concerns, we’re close enough to know what’s going on in their lives. We will know if – say – they’re grieving and not in a headspace to want to talk about death. We’ll understand if the person we’re sexting is a survivor of abuse and therefore unlikely to respond well to unanticipated sexual fantasies storming into their phone.By utilising scripts and seeking permission, we remove the need to think empathetically about the other person’s readiness to receive before we begin the conversation. We put the onus on them to do the work – they need to decide if they’re ready. We put the other person in the awkward position of having to say no.What I failed to realise is that in the absence of that empathetic connection, scripts, boundaries and prompts become absolutely essential. If someone is vulnerable for health reasons – physical or mental – because of something going on in their lives or for some other reason, we shouldn’t wait for some grand ethical revolution to give them the time and space they need to preserve their own sense of wellbeing.To put it bluntly, by shitting on the positive ethical role that asserting emotional and interpersonal boundaries can play, I was demonstrating precisely the lack of care that I thought those boundaries demonstrated.There are, as political philosopher Zara Bain pointed out to me, myriad reasons why someone might need to assert boundaries despite desperately wanting to care for a friend. They might even resent needing those boundaries, wishing they had the capacity to be constantly available. For them, the script is a tool to protect themselves when other people aren’t aware, or aren’t considering, their needs and interests.As it turned out, I was more like the professor than I thought. It’s easy to prioritise our own needs and experiences. It’s easy to see changing practices through our own lens and to ridicule them on that basis (and in all honesty, I think if someone like me were to use the script Fabello provided, I’d deserve to be ridiculed), but that only serves to demonstrate why they’re necessary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c5615e586cce2e57261bfb812da7b7980ab4abc/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f28fc8fc991fb6e374f1066bdc2f62d","title":"ben jennings christmas yet to come cartoon","story":"The 2019  and Observer appeal is supporting four charities that help to slow down the damage from the climate crisis.

By 2025 there will be more than 330, based on an analysis of company announcements.New European Union rules come into force on 1 January that will heavily penalise carmakers if average carbon dioxide emissions from the cars they sell rise above 95g per kilometre. If carmakers exceed that limit, they will have to pay a fine of €95 (£79) for every gram over the target, multiplied by the total number of cars they sell.The excess emissions bill would have been £28.6bn on 2018 sales figures, according to analysis by the automotive consultancy Jato Dynamics, illustrating the extent of the change required by carmakers over a short period of time. Jato analyst Felipe Muñoz said there will still be large fines, as companies keep selling profitable internal combustion engine cars and struggle to bring down EV prices to parity with their fossil-fuel peers.“It is very difficult for carmakers to change manufacturing infrastructure in such a short period of time,” Muñoz said.However, some analysts take a more sceptical view of the industry that spawned the Dieselgate scandal, in which Volkswagen and Daimler were shown to have deliberately cheated emissions regulations. Carmakers successfully lobbied for a rule that means cars emitting less than 50g of carbon dioxide per kilometre are eligible for so-called super-credits, a controversial policy which means that every electric vehicle sold counts as two cars. That makes it easier for carmakers to meet their targets, even if average emissions from their cars are actually higher than the rules stipulate.Multiple new electric car models will go on sale just in time to qualify for EU regulations. In November the first of Volkswagen’s ID.3 cars rolled off a new electric production line in Zwickau, eastern Germany, that will be able to produce 330,000 vehicles a year by 2021. The first of BMW’s Mini Electric models, made in Oxford, will arrive in showrooms in March. Vauxhall, owned by France’s PSA Group, will start production of its Corsa-e in January, with sales to begin in March.Sales of pure electric vehicles will still be dwarfed by those of cars with conventional fossil-fuel engines, as well as hybrids that use both battery and internal combustion power. However, the electric vehicle surge is likely to contribute to significant price reductions, as carmakers compete for buyers beyond the early adopters willing to pay a premium.Consultants at Deloitte estimate the market will reach a tipping point in 2022, when the cost of ownership of an electric car is on par with its internal combustion engine counterparts. Separate research by the International Council on Clean Transportation suggested this was already the case in February in five European countries, including the UK.In the UK, some drivers anxious about the short range of electric vehicles on a single charge will be put off from buying them until the development of charging infrastructure spreads across the country. However, scandals such as Dieselgate have made investors “acutely aware” of the need to increase electric sales and comply with emissions regulations, according to Arlene Ewing, a director at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.“Brand is all to a carmaker and failure to meet the deadline may adversely affect their brand, reputation and, ultimately, sales,” she said. “We have seen this before. Consumers tend to be brand loyal.”Rising demand from consumers has also filtered through to used electric cars: listings website CarGurus found that second-hand prices of some models had risen during 2019. Tom Leathes, the chief executive of rival car sales platform Motorway, said the market was growing “extremely fast”, despite the complications of selling cars that include separately leased batteries.“We expect this segment to grow year on year for at least another 10 years as electric’s share of the new car market continues to grow exponentially,” Leathes said.Volkswagen ID.3Price: under £26,000, range: 205 miles, due in early 2020The “third-generation” mass-market vehicle from the world’s largest carmaker will be swiftly followed by the ID.4 SUV, on the same electric vehicles platform, and production will be carbon neutral, VW claims.Vauxhall Corsa-ePrice: £26,490, range: 209 miles, due in April 2020Along with the Mini, the Corsa is one of the first of the UK’s perennial bestsellers to get an electric makeover. It shares its core parts with Peugeot’s e-208, another of the PSA Group’s key superminis.Tesla Model YPrice: about £30,300, range: 230 miles, production to start in summer 2020The latest model from the company that kicked off the electric car race will be the Model Y, a compact SUV that can fit seven people. The Model Y will eventually be built on the same site as a recently announced Tesla battery plant in Berlin.Ford Mustang Mach-EPrice: about £35,000, range: 370 miles, expected late 2020The Mustang Mach-E is aimed at the booming family-friendly SUV market. The car will be the first all-electric vehicle from the US carmaker, which has been slow to develop new sources of power.Fiat 500 ElectricPrice: about £28,000, range: tba, due in late 2020Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has been an emissions laggard because of its gas-guzzling Jeep. The company’s first fully electric car, the redesigned 500 Electric, will be made in its Mirafiori factory near Turin, with a right-hand drive version launched late in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0a38e1026dc873712bb00bb3e927573bf4ae06e/0_269_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73e99631b4a5f9d922e9773a296c8a4e","title":"ten wildlife conservation success stories 2019 aoe","story":"There has not been much good news for life on Earth this year, with up to 1m species at risk of annihilation, many within decades.

Thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it seems post–Christmas sales no longer hold the sense of anticipation they once did with many shoppers choosing to eschew them altogether.When it comes to fashion many are turning to buying secondhand – where lower prices come with the added benefit of reduced impact on the environment.“There are signs of an emerging fatigue about frenzied mass consumerism and its impact on the planet,” says Nina Marston, the beauty and fashion analyst at Euromonitor International.This is backed up by research from the retail analyst Edited, whose “Black Friday and Cyber Monday postmortem” report stated that “growing environmental concerns paired with more frequent promotional strategies has resulted in discounting fatigue from consumers, leading to retailers that opt out of running sales”.There will, of course, still be plenty of sales in the run-up to the new year and beyond – and while impulse buys and clothes bought to be worn once are now decidedly unchic, investment purchases at a reduced price still hold appeal.Here are five pieces which will help you make a stylish, and eco-friendly, start to the new year and beyond.The sale might be dead but the bralet most certainly isn’t. Bralets were worn under summer jackets on SS20 catwalks, including Anna Sui, and loosely layered over strappy tops at Vera Wang, making it one of the most versatile items you can pick up in the sales. Asos and Topshop have numerous longline styles designed to be worn as standalone pieces, but for those who’ve been eyeing up Savage x Fenty since September, bralets worn as underwear one day, outerwear the next, are value for money.Shiny dresses in gold, silver and primary colours are a Christmas party staple – and now, you guessed it, they’re heading straight for the sale rails. Good news, however: a quick glance at springsummer collections from Balenciaga, Halpern, Versace and others suggests that, this year, the metallic look is here to stay. On the high street, Zara has opted for a host of metallic mini, midi and ankle-grazing gowns.Microbags, though big on Instagram and the red carpet, were always daft, being unable to accommodate more than a lip balm. In any case, this season big bags are set for a comeback. Of course, being entirely more practical, big bags never really went away – look out for supersized crochet carriers, as seen at Off White, or giant bucket bags like those at Marni.Recently announced as Pantone’s colour of the year, classic blue is set to be big next season. When shopping the sales, avoid last summer’s prairie pastels and instead opt for the kind of heavy, solid hues seen on suits at Balmain and jackets at Fila, \u0026amp Other Stories has everything from dresses to jumpers in the shade.Hacking the high street doesn’t get simpler than coords (coordinates), especially when many stores sell – and discount – different items with the same pattern, print, or material. Labels including Palm Angels, Dries Van Noten and Sacai all opted for coords on the catwalk, with the matchy-matchy look crossing both mens and womenswear (ideal if you shop for a shared wardrobe). River Island and Nobody’s Child are your best bets for matching sets in the sales and, of course, you can always mix it up to get more bang for your buck."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dbdac535297a81eb54e410d8d374ab6191eb561/26_0_2083_1250/master/2083.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edebf8eceb2041638eaa17e15126d3a6 645w","title":"cats film resupplied improved visuals","story":"New version of widely derided movie starring Idris Elba and Judi Dench to get CGI updateA new version of Tom Hooper’s film adaptation of the musical Cats with “improved visuals” is reportedly being sent to cinemas after a barrage of negative reviews in which the film was hammered for its “disturbing” CGI effects.On Sunday, the Hollywood Reporter said it had seen a note that was sent by Universal Studios to thousands of cinemas in the US confirming that a new version with “some improved visual effects” was being distributed to chains.Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association – the national trade body for cinema operators in Britain – said he understood the decision to “resupply” the film was a worldwide move and that UK cinemas were being notified of this on Monday.“The resupply, I think, reflects the complexity of the CGI going into the film and the fact that in the end production went right down to the wire,” he added. “With the luxury of a little more time, the production team have had the opportunity to further finesse some of the visual effects.”The decision to resupply a film is rare, with the Hollywood Reporter calling it “unheard of for a finished film already in release”.In the US, Cats took $6.5m (£5m) on its opening day, while it managed £3.3m from its release in the UK and Ireland, which culminated in a total worldwide opening that was well below the £15m predicted by some analysts.Some have pointed to the example of The Greatest Showman, which had a lukewarm opening of $8.8m in the US before going on to become a sustained hit at the box office, with the musical starring Hugh Jackman eventually taking $440m worldwide.But the visual effects used in Hooper’s Cats, in which the animals, played by actors including Dame Judi Dench, Idris Elba and James Corden, are shown with some human body parts and others feline, have bemused and disturbed reviewers and audience members. Hooper admitted that he had barely finished the film, which cost $100m, before its New York premiere last week. said the effects used in the film would “haunt viewers for a generation”, while Rolling Stone said the film “easily scores as the bottom of the 2019 barrel”. The New York Times review said “a doctoral thesis could be written on how this misfire sputtered into existence”. US entertainment website the Ringer said the film was almost “an accidental masterpiece: not the Christmas blockbuster we need, but the one that we deserve” but adding that it was “too boring to get so performatively worked up about”.At screenings, “an agog silence dominated in London and New York cinemas, as critics struggled to process the images which had gone before,” according to the ’s film editor, Catherine Shoard, who pointed out that the sexualisation of the human felines in Cats made its U certificate surprising.Some of its stars mounted a defence. Jason Derulo, who plays Rum Tum Tugger, told TMZ that “reviews don’t matter,” and that “at the end of the day, the people are going to go see it, there’s going to be a deportation to another dimension.“When it came out on Broadway, it was the same thing. People were like: ‘What is this? This is something totally different.’ Any time that you defy the rules there’s going to be some pushback, obviously. It’s an incredible piece of art done by some of the best people in the world.”Universal did not respond to a request for comment from the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c2b90423b3ef9a185bb7df002157e064448a672/0_241_4503_2701/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d9a0f90984b568215d24f6f0e431dc","title":"manchester city liverpool jurgen klopp","story":"Jürgen Klopp says Manchester City have helped Liverpool by forcing them to improve. Pep Guardiola’s team have won the past two Premier League titles with 100 and then 98 points and Klopp’s players have risen to the challenge to open a substantial lead this season.Their fixture on Thursday at second-placed Leicester gives a clear indication of the dramatic increase in standards over the past few years. Leicester are better off for points and goals than they were at this stage of the 2015-16 season when they won the title, yet Liverpool arrive with a 10-point advantage and a game in hand.“The Premier League has changed in the short time I have been in England,” Klopp said. “It is not allowed to lose games any more, not if you want to win the title. The reason for that is the consistency Manchester City have shown in the last three years. They have raised the bar massively and, to be honest, they have helped us by forcing us to try and catch up with them. It is difficult, obviously, when you have to be ready to win a football game every three days but winning the Premier League should be difficult.”Klopp cites Watford as an example of the strength all the way down the league. Liverpool’s somewhat laboured victory against the bottom side a couple of weeks ago was dismissed as an off-day by some but a much improved Watford performance at Anfield was followed by an impressive defeat of Manchester United.“A few weeks ago Watford looked like they were gone, relegated,” Klopp said. “Then they changed their manager and now everyone down there is on their toes again. The top four is the same. A short time ago everyone was saying it was already established but now there are suddenly seven or eight teams back fighting for European places again.”Klopp has become used to the English penchant for a hectic festive period in the last four years, though he is not a complete fan.“This is absolutely not OK, yet we still have it. Sports science gives you absolutely nothing to deal with this – the body needs a specific amount of time to recover and go again – but we ignore that completely. The managers all say it should not happen, but no one is listening.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8e852698a2f418d0254307e49a5122a7fc01c08/0_303_2430_1457/master/2430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5079246560756bad9587e4a4a2eae361","title":"mikel arteta granit xhaka arsenal","story":"Mikel Arteta has told Granit Xhaka that the midfielder’s future lies with Arsenal despite reports in Germany linking him with Hertha Berlin. The new head coach also revealed that Xhaka was a potential transfer target for Pep Guardiola and Manchester City before the player’s move to north London.Xhaka has recently been reintegrated into Arsenal’s side after a month-long absence caused by his fallout with a section of the support. He has started four matches in December and, with Arteta watching from the Goodison Park stands on Saturday, was one of their better performers in the goalless draw with Everton. It has been a relatively successful return, perhaps helped by the club’s managerial situation dominating the news cycle, and Arteta believes he can build on that with a player he has always rated.By the time Arteta joined Manchester City’s coaching staff with Guardiola in July 2016, Xhaka had signed for Arsenal from Borussia Mönchengladbach with City having signed Ilkay Gündogan for the central midfield position. But he explained the Switzerland international had been among those under consideration.“When I was going from Arsenal to City to start coaching and we were looking in that position, he was one of the players on my list,” Arteta said. “This is how much I liked him. I was happy when Arsenal signed him because I thought he was going to be a terrific player.“ He has done some really good things and now he has got stuck in a very difficult situation that, I think, was growing and growing and growing and one day it exploded. But I have been amazed as well by how this relationship is starting to come back a little bit and I think the fans have been very, very positive about him. Obviously it is difficult to change completely the scenario from where he was to a magnificent one. But I think we are in the right direction with him.”Asked whether he had spoken to Xhaka about his future, amid suggestions the player is keen to join Jürgen Klinsmann’s Hertha, Arteta said he had told the 27-year-old he can be a focal point as Arsenal look to haul themselves out of the bottom half, beginning at Bournemouth on Boxing Day.“I told him how much I like him and what I expect from him,” Arteta said. “How important he is for the team. I am here to help him, I want him to feel that we are right behind him. Not just myself but the whole club. If we can get the people in the right way as well, the fans with him, I think it will be helpful for the team, which is where it matters.”Arteta confirmed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who succeeded Xhaka as club captain, would retain the armband on Boxing Day but left open the possibility of change.“I don’t want to change everything drastically in two days,” he said. “I want to put my feelings slowly, I want to see what is going around, and in the right moment I will make the decisions for the benefit of the team and the club. At the moment I don’t think it is the right time, with the amount of games coming up and the amount of things that have to be done, to change too many things.”Footage of Arteta’s early training sessions, in which he has preached simple tenets involving passing and awareness of space, has proved popular and his ultimate aim is to play a style similar to that of Guardiola, even if the results will not be instant.“That’s what I was born with, that’s what I understand and what I believe is the best way to play,” he said. “But the context is very important, and the context right now, here, is not Manchester City. It is completely different. So I can’t demand the players to do some things because I will expose them and that is the last thing I want to do. I want to give them confidence, reassurance and guidance. But slowly, slowly, slowly, hopefully we will get to where I want.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5168c252523f5f45ecef6e88420198b5482ff14d/66_81_3824_2294/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83ee5c2eda7ee2b63e941f381338d408","title":"sam kerr vivianne miedema wsl messi ronaldo womens football 2020","story":"Friday is the day that Sam Kerr officially joins Chelsea as the mid-season transfer window opens, the arrival of the player I consider the best No 9 in the world ending an amazing year for women’s football.It has been a year of massive forward strides. The World Cup obviously was huge, and Megan Rapinoe brought positive attention to the women’s game by being brave and speaking about important issues while also doing her talking on the pitch, and there have been big signings, and groundbreaking sponsorship and broadcasting deals. Meanwhile clubs playing in men’s stadiums has become normalised and crowds of 30,000-plus have turned up for league games – there has been one incredible moment after another. After the World Cup the only worry was whether that momentum could be carried forward, and I think that has been achieved.It will be harder to maintain that growth in 2020, without a showpiece event for the women’s game. There will be the Olympics, but because it is not solely about football and it is being played in Tokyo, a long way away with an inconvenient time difference – the women’s final kicks off at 3am BST – it will very easily get lost. The 2012 Games were a real game-changer for women’s football but this time excitement might not build unless Team GB look likely to win a medal.There is so much to look forward to before then, including a potential WSL title decider just a few weeks into the new year when Chelsea travel to Arsenal for what might end up being Kerr’s debut. Obviously she is likely to need an adaptation period. She is good enough to hit the ground running immediately but this is a player who has never played in Europe, and who has been playing in America where there is more of a transitional game, with a greater reliance on athleticism and less of a tactical approach.But Chelsea can’t really afford to sit around waiting for her to hit her stride. After beating Manchester City at the start of December they could manage only a draw at struggling Liverpool in their last game before the winter break, and now the pressure is really on them. They are third in the league, four points behind Arsenal, and even with a game in hand their margin for error is slender. Defeat next month against an Arsenal team that have lost once all season will significantly dent their title chances.But even if Kerr’s arrival doesn’t immediately turn Chelsea into champions, it is a massive moment for the women’s game in this country. She has become a symbol of the Women’s Super League’s progression and potential, and like when David Beckham moved in the other direction and massively increased the amount of global attention MLS enjoyed, Kerr’s arrival means that people around the world will be interested in what is happening here.Chelsea and the WSL in general will enjoy new commercial opportunities, and though the league was already moving in the right direction suddenly that momentum can accelerate. It will be interesting to see how much thought has gone into marketing her arrival: will Chelsea try to tap into the big Australian community in west London? Will Nike, which sponsors Kerr and Chelsea, put its might behind the move, like Adidas did when Paul Pogba rejoined Manchester United?Also interesting will be the impact of her arrival on Vivianne Miedema, who has been a phenomenon at Arsenal for the last couple of years but now finds her position as the league’s marquee player under threat. Miedema is a European champion and World Cup finalist, and her goalscoring record has been immense, but if I were forced to choose between the two players I would say Kerr edges it, because of her pace, dynamic movement and her ability to frighten defenders. Miedema is supreme in the penalty area, but Kerr’s movement around it is a constant threat.Neither player was in the Ballon d’Or top three, but they will have been rightly disappointed not to have been in that conversation and in 2020 we will have two players in England whose ambition will be to prove themselves the world’s best forward. Though I wouldn’t compare them as players to the men, it could be something like the Messi v Ronaldo battle while they were at Barcelona and Real Madrid: two outstanding players at rival clubs, pushing each other to ever greater levels of performance and achievement.For those who have not seen much of Kerr, I would compare her to Jamie Vardy. She is especially brilliant on transitions: when a midfielder gets the ball and has the ability to pass between or over defenders, that’s when she comes alive. When there’s room for her to run in behind a defence, she is the best in the world by far. Her movement is very good, she is always active across the line of defence, and when she gets in behind she is deadly. She can finish with either foot, and is great in the air for someone who at a shade under 5ft 6in is not exactly tall.She is a bit like her compatriot Tim Cahill, in that her ability to score with her head is constantly surprising. Watching Chelsea’s game against Manchester City this month it was striking how many counterattacking moments they had, without finding the right pass in transition. Kerr’s arrival will make them so much more dangerous at these moments – so long as her teammates find the right pass. In the World Cup you also saw a player who was capable of bearing the responsibility of leading – and in many ways carrying – a team: scoring the goals, taking penalties.It will be interesting to see whether any of the other WSL teams feel pressured into making moves during a transfer window that tends to be very quiet in the women’s game. Kerr’s arrival shows not only that some of our teams can pay big money for the right players, but that in comparison with Spain – where there are some good teams but the league as a whole is struggling – or Italy – where clubs would have been unable to afford her – or France – where Lyon win every year by a mile and there’s no real challenge – or Germany – which is seen as a very demanding league that can be difficult for foreign players to acclimatise to – England now has a genuine case for being considered the ideal destination for the best players in the world.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

Mauricio Pochettino was sacked the following month, without winning another league game. Results have improved since José Mourinho’s appointment, but Tottenham’s most recent game – against Chelsea on Sunday – was another trial, and Son Heung-min will miss this match as a result of his red card in that one.Brighton’s record on their travels is poor, and it gets worse the further they travel. It’s the 16th-best away record in the Premier League overall, but they have only won one point when forced to go further north than Watford (that’s 0.2 points per game) compared with seven points garnered in London and its environs (at 1.75 points per game). As such, the omens are good of further glory here but the long-term prognosis is bad (with only the trips to West Ham and Southampton to come within their approximately-65-mile comfort zone). But there is also a question of priorities: they are hosting Bournemouth in a couple of days and could perhaps decide that focusing on that match might mean they win one of the two fixtures where a full-on commitment to this one could end with them winning neither.Anyway, welcome.

Rihana includes a pack of Kurkure corn puffs in her daily diet.Prasiddhika is among 100 schoolchildren in seven countries asked by researchers from University College London to film themselves and the food they eat for a study about the exposure of children to unhealthy diets.Pupils Laxmi and Nima eat six packs of instant noodles between them each day. “We see Coke on TV during races and football matches. We also see instant noodles on advertisements,” they say.“The situation regarding junk food is very worrisome in Nepal,” says Atul Upadhyay of the global health organisation Helen Keller International, who is featured in UCL’s Nepal film study, produced in collaboration with the Kathmandu-based centre for research on environment, health and population activities. “Children are eating more unhealthy food than they are eating healthy food.”Professor Sarah Hawkes, director of UCL’s centre for gender and global health, and the lead researcher behind the project, says the footage collected by children in Nepal was similar to those filmed in Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Tunisia, Vietnam and the UK.“All children we worked with shared the common experience of pervasive, powerful and, it seems, often unregulated advertising and promotion,” she says.“The children’s footage vividly communicates that, once they step outside schools, they, and their parents, have very little control over what they see and experience, what is on their local high street, or what is going into the food they purchase there.”Alongside the films, researchers have studied how each country has implemented World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations that include ways to prevent and control non-communicable diseases at national level.In Nepal’s case, researchers said, policies fell short. There is no tax on sugary drinks and no ban on trans fats in the food chain.None of the seven countries subsidised healthy foods, the findings showed.No country has taken up the WHO recommendation to ban trans fats in the food chain. Some progress has been made in Tunisia, where a law was passed in 2017 to tax sugar-sweetened drinks.Recent studies published in the Lancet medical journal showed that more than a third of low- and middle-income countries are affected by the double burden of malnutrition, meaning that children not having enough food in poor countries are also in danger of obesity, or eating too many empty calories in the form of junk food.“The prevalence of poor dental health is increasing alongside rises in consumption of sugar, including in sugary drinks,” adds Hawkes. “The sugary drinks industry is spending vast amounts of money advertising to populations in low- and middle-income countries. Coca-Cola plans to spend $12bn on marketing in Africa by 2020.”Anna Purdie, programme manager at UCL centre for gender and global health, says there is a growing global crisis and, in many countries, a policy vacuum on tackling it.“The films showed us incredibly high levels of unhealthy food consumption and pervasive advertising – highlighting that living environments across the globe are not ‘fit for purpose’ when it comes to healthy diets. They make it increasingly difficult for young people to eat well and increasingly easy to eat badly,” she says.Purdie says there were a number of obstacles to tackling the problem, including the influence manufacturers and corporations wield over politicians, the lack of interest in non-communicable diseases from donors, and politicians’ fears about negative public reactions to regulation. Salt and sugar also remain embedded in traditional dishes. “The environments around us are becoming increasingly unhealthy, while narratives remain heavily anchored on the failure of the inidual, rather than the failure of our environments,” Purdie says.“It is far too easy to eat badly, and far too difficult to eat well. Responsibility for this does not just lie with iniduals. Rigorous policy changes will be required … but this means going up against powerful and wealthy corporations and often governments who are not interested in seeing this change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55df34d39748c4db81e50e84783dada6a442f356/0_140_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9c44f0afb75605fb311b7b3b11c2905","title":"how the guardians engineering team supports the 24 hour news cycle","story":"Managing the out of hours engineer support rota to meet the demands of a global news operationNews happens 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  runs a round the clock operation with journalists working across global time zones.It’s essential our audience can access our journalism at all times, we cannot have any disruption to our service.Whilst we build our software for reliability through the use of microservices and removal of single points of failure, occasionally we need an engineer to take a look at a problem out of regular working hours. With complex software and integration across a wide variety of systems, it’s not possible to predict all technical failures.During UK office hours engineers who maintain the systems are available to fix issues. Out of hours support is provided for a defined set of critical systems only, by a small number of on-call engineers covering evenings, weekends and public holidays. Undertaking an on-call shift is optional at the , engineers decide their shifts and work around other commitments.Our systems predominantly run in public clouds. The development teams follow a dev-ops mentality we don’t have operations teams. This allows us to move fast when developing. We want to share our experience with our on-call process so you can learn what works for us.At the beginning of each shift, the engineers rolling off shift meet with the new shift at a handover meeting. The aim of the meeting is to share knowledge from the previous week and discuss any incidents. A first-line support representative also attends to highlight any potential risks that have been identified in the upcoming week. The remit of on-call covers a subset of our systems, one engineer may handle initial debugging, while another engineer can manage communication with stakeholders.Technical issues can be surfaced to the first-line support team through automated alerts but often they are first reported by our editorial colleagues. The strong relationship between this team and editorial is crucial in identifying and fixing issues promptly.First-line support triage incoming issues and only escalate if they are of the highest priority (P1) usually indicating problems with publishing content, the slow rendering of our articles, or with our news apps or breaking news notifications.At first glance this might seem like overkill, but it’s extremely useful if the call is made in the early hours of the morningIf the first-line support team determine that the issue requires escalation, they will telephone one of the on-call engineers. The engineer will then follow a playbook that outlines what to do next.The initial advice is to understand the problem. It is critical engineers have a clear grasp of the problem to avoid merely speculating on solutions or making assumptions. We have pre-canned questions the engineer can ask first-line support in order to gather the right information.At first glance this might seem like overkill, but it’s extremely useful if the call is made in the early hours of the morning and ensures the rapid collection of data.Next the engineer will contact the other on-call engineer. It’s important that we communicate effectively during the incident and have a log of information to reflect on afterwards. Our engineers are responsible for sending out communication to the business and keeping an event timeline. A timeline is a crucial document for reflecting on the incident and will revisit this later.Our engineers follow playbooks which document steps for diagnosing a problem, the system architecture, links to useful dashboards and other tools. We use playbooks as we believe that a clear process is the best solution to relieving the pressure on engineers when dealing with out-of-hours calls. If the engineers are able to fix the issue they then document the incident in a spreadsheet and send out communication to the business.Our on-call engineers are not expected to solve every problem that is reported out of hours. If the problem cannot be solved by following the playbook, and we agree that it continues to be urgent, we will escalate to more specialised staff. We have decided that if the people on call are not able to fix the issue within 30 minutes, they will contact third-line support. The third-line support staff are responsible for the specific system exhibiting the issue and will provide support for fixing the underlying problem.It’s important to us that our on-call engineers rest after responding to incidents late at night or early in the morning. Once everyone is back in the office we organise an immediate retrospective meeting to go over the incident. The intent is to understand the problem with a view to identifying actions and areas of improvement in the overall process.Apply for one of our open positions here.We aim to be as fair and transparent as possible in our hiring process. Similar to other organisations, there is a CV screening, phone interview, coding exercise and a face to face interview. Read more about what to expect and apply now here.We understand that taking part in the on-call rota can be somewhat disruptive, we provide laptops and devices so they are able to investigate incidents from any location. For special events such as elections we have arranged out-of-hours capacity.Being on-call can be daunting, but with the right process and support in place we have found we can mitigate this. A step-by-step process and simple, clear up-to-date documentation is critical in helping our engineers solve problems quickly and effectively.We have a shared understanding of what is supported by our on-call engineers which greatly simplifies our process. Hopefully you can use some of our learnings to improve your own process.

I went for a walk. There were no arguments about what to watch on TV. Best Christmas everI haven’t always hated Christmas I think I enjoyed it as a kid. Not so much since. It is a little about the food (if turkey and sprouts are such good news, why don’t we eat them on any other day, eh?). It has a little more to do with rampant consumerism. Gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath … funny how a festival that is supposed to be about the birth of Christ has come to encompass so many Christian sins. But this isn’t about him it’s about me, my own family and my own insecurities.I think things turned sour in my 30s, when my siblings selfishly started having families of their own. Suddenly there were new people and generations involved it became more complicated logistically, as what had been a simple family gathering exploded. This lot went here, that lot there … oh, God, what about Sam? Where’s he going to go? Whose turn is it? I wasn’t involved in these conversations, but I’m sure they happened. They did in my mind, anyway. I had become the grumpy grandad no one wanted, before even being a dad.I could – and should – have just spent Christmas alone, for everyone’s sake. But that would have made them feel bad, and I didn’t want that or to be felt sorry for. So I went along, to wherever there was room or I was least unwelcome, to whoever’s turn it was. I ate my sprouts – mmm – and I tried to be the fun uncle, and not to disapprove so obviously of the mountains of presents being ripped open (while also, hypocritically, feeling sorry for myself as I strung out the unwrapping of my own pitiful molehill of hastily thrown-together afterthoughts). I don’t think I fooled anyone.And then one year I did fool them – everyone. Uncharacteristically, and improbably, I found myself in the situation known as having a girlfriend (I had had them before, just not for Christmas). She came with a family of her own, and they asked me if I would like to spend Christmas with them. No, of course I bloody wouldn’t, but it gave me an idea. That’s very kind, I said, but I’m spending it with my family. They’d be devastated if I wasn’t there. (Ha!)See where this is going? I then told my family that I would be spending Christmas with my girlfriend’s family – I was keen to get to know them better. And my family concealed any relief they may have been feeling. At least they didn’t need to feel sorry for me because I wouldn’t be alone at home …Which is exactly what and where I was, of course. By myself, as myself. I had a steak – with chips, no sprouts – and a nice bottle of rioja. (I don’t really remember that it was rioja, but in my mind it was a grade or two above the usual. It could have even broken the £10 barrier.) I toasted absent friends and family. Yeah, maybe there was a bit of gluttony involved, but it’s hard to remain sin-free at Christmas. I went for a walk London is beautiful on Christmas Day. There were no arguments about what to watch I caught up on some of the films I had missed in the year just gone. I may have felt a little sorry for myself, but I thoroughly enjoyed doing so. It was perfect – best Christmas ever. But impossible to repeat.It turns out the girlfriend wasn’t just for Christmas, but for life (so far). We did some new-generation-creating of our own, and since then, as you can imagine, it has been impossible to sneak off. But that’s OK.I still hate Christmas because of the turkey, sprouts and all of that sinning. Also wrapping – I really don’t like wrapping. But now I don’t have to pretend not to hate it: I’m the Grinch, but out and proud. Which is liberating, even amusing – for me. And I’ll always have the memories of the year I went free solo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d2f7c3a288dc213dc40651a1a50cbb34cd6db75/803_144_3843_2305/master/3843.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4c2a497da9d9830dd07efbcd24de7e5","title":"danny dyer actor follow my dreams","story":"In this series writers celebrate a person who changed their lives. Here Coco Khan thanks the actor for all the laughs – and a valuable life lessonAll right, mate? Bit naughty, but this year I’m breaking with Christmas tradition to send a massive cheers to you, pal. Because although I’ve never been one for celebrities, some figures seem to travel with you through life and somehow you’ve been everywhere with me, bringing joy, inspiration, maybe even advice. Is this a bit much? Let me start from the beginning.Like you, I grew up in working-class east London. Maybe it was this commonality that made you such a superstar among the teenage boys at school but they adored you. There would always be one lad pushing to watch a film of yours at any school gathering, and over time I must have seen them all. At uni and after, I still watched your films, but it was different. These new people in my life – often middle class, maybe even posh – enjoyed your stuff in a cultish way (see: The Business) but with irony, with an implied sneer under the smile. I joined in because I wanted to seem cultured and I didn’t know, then, that some people will never see people like us as creative contenders, whatever we do.I don’t remember the order of how things went after that. At some point I was reading up on Harold Pinter after his death, how he had championed your talent when no one else could see past your accent, and how you finessed difficult stage roles that even renowned actors couldn’t manage. I saw an interview with you where you said you took naff parts in crap films because, unlike the Eton actors, you couldn’t afford to turn a job down, and those jobs were something. I felt that deeply. I know how heavy something can weigh, how sometimes something can trap you and keep you in your place. I think of all the odd jobs I took – writing instruction manuals, editing a magazine about stepladders – while my peers flew. But I never grumbled, because it was something.Still, I wanted someone to give me a break and I must have wanted the same for you, because when I heard you had landed a lead role on EastEnders I cheered aloud, an involuntary “Yes mate!” that I didn’t know was coming. Sure, I’m an avid EastEnders watcher glad to have you back in my life, but it wasn’t that. I was happy because I knew you had finally got your break. You did it, Danny! National treasure status was always your destiny and my oh my, haven’t you delivered? Whether it’s slagging off David Cameron or bamboozling Who Do You Think You Are?, the nation falls ever deeper under your thrall.So that’s why I’m raising a glass to you – a toast for all the laughs over the years and because you taught me a valuable lesson: don’t look for the endorsement of those who will never give it to you. Instead, find those who share your vision, work with your friends (find your Pinter!) and the rest is history. If the gatekeepers won’t open the door, blow the bloody doors off. And if they continue to underestimate you, well, they’re a bunch of mugs anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c668761df427984507ce1b8ffcf0500177be62/0_286_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b770c9b7dc7c2841d7a7e4b54a519e67","title":"2010 2019 a decade in pictures","story":"’s picture editors take a look back at some of the news photography that has defined the past 10 yearsFrom the earthquake in Haiti at the start of 2010, the decade was defined by successive international refugee crises, natural disasters and conflict.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s crucial for everyone to be free to say what they think and for politicians to respond, but democracy shouldn’t be about decibel levels. An opinion is no more valid because it is expressed more loudly, repeatedly, or abusively.”He quickly accepted that he has become known for raising his voice, but added: “What bothers me is there are people on the internet and in some newspapers who cannot entertain the idea that anyone can honourably hold an opinion which differs from their own. They are the angels and anyone who dares disagree is the devil who wants the country to be poorer, less free, or less secure. That mindset started to infect parliament too. That is wrong.”“If democrats show no respect for each other, it just encourages anti-democrats. It’s high time we learned to disagree agreeably.”He went on to say his best friend was not an extremist, a racist, or a fascist because he was a Brexiter, nor was he a traitor, a malcontent, or an enemy of the people because he was a remainer.Bercow follows the actor Danny Dyer, the whistleblower Edward Snowden and Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered MP Jo Cox, in delivering the annual rival to the Queen’s broadcast. Channel 4 has produced an alternative message for the past 25 years.The speech was delivered from a classroom in Bercow’s children’s state secondary school. He went on to criticise the role social media has played in amplifying hatred, racism, misogyny and abuse.“As I sit here in my kids’ fantastic state secondary, I have to say I worry about that. Incidentally, if you want to see an example of respectful debate, take a look at the UK youth parliament,” he said. “They spoke well, respected one another, and behaved better than many political campaigners, two, three and four times their age.”Bercow continued: “Let’s take inspiration from young people. They are the future. Let’s try to re-establish a civility of discourse. It would be good for parliament, for democracy, and for our own mental health – an issue which is finally getting the attention it needs.”As Bercow’s calls for “Order!” have made him an international celebrity, he ended his speech saying it with a group of schoolchildren."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f9215468ef4ae410f6cf103ab3a3f65ca2735de/0_130_3892_2336/master/3892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ec462975dad3373444c3a840d505532","title":"post brexit uk always welcome back in eu says timmermans","story":"European commission’s VP writes ‘love letter’ to Britons, saying UK unnecessarily damaged by BrexitBritain has been unnecessarily damaged by Brexit and “more will follow”, the vice-president of the European commission has written in a “love letter” to the British people in which he promises a warm welcome back should attitudes change.Frans Timmermans, who is Ursula von der Leyen’s deputy in her role as European commission president, writes that British scepticism of the EU had been an asset to the bloc as he expresses his own feelings of rejection ahead of the country’s impending departure on 31 January, likening himself to a jilted “old lover”.Writing in the , Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who was also deputy to Jean-Claude Juncker, says he first grew to love the UK and the character of its people through his time at a British school in Rome, Saint George’s English School.The British doubts over the European project had offered a healthy check on the more federalist ambitions of figures through the decades, he suggests in his article. He writes: “I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I’m like an old lover.“I know your strengths and your weaknesses. I know you can be generous but also miserly. I know you believe yourself to be unique and different. And of course you are in many ways, but perhaps less than you think.”“You will never stop referring to the rest of us as ‘the continent’,” Timmermans adds of the British attitude through the decades to EU membership. “It helps you to create a distance you think you need. But it also prevents you from seeing that in fact we all need a bit of distance between us. All European nations are unique. Our differences are a source of admiration, surprise, discomfort, misunderstanding, ridicule, caricature and, yes, love.”Negotiations on the future relationship will start in earnest in March once the UK has formally withdrawn and negotiating positions on both sides of the channel have been confirmed.Boris Johnson has said he will not extend the transition period, during which the UK will remain in the customs union and single market but not the EU’s decision-making institutions, beyond December 2020.Clashes are expected over access to British waters for European fishing fleets and, more significantly, the EU demand that the British government sign up to its environmental, social and fiscal rules in return for tariff-free trade in goods.Timmermans talks of his grief at the unpicking of the relationship built since the UK’s accession to the European economic community in 1973. He suggests that David Cameron’s decision to hold the 2016 referendum was unnecessary.He writes: “You were in two minds about it, like you have always been in two minds about the EU. I wish you had stuck to that attitude – it served you well and it kept all of us in better shape.“Was it necessary to force the issue? Not at all. But you did. And the sad thing is: I see it is hurting you. Because the two minds will still be there, even after you have left. In the process, so much unnecessary damage has been done to you and all of us. And I fear more will follow.”Timmermans concludes, however, that the UK “will always be welcome to come back”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cd2819e1714a52d584e9b3c12a565e44b6c9b0c/0_315_3749_2250/master/3749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f10b3f7e5a2d14192e89a781da768b0","title":"scientists attempt to recreate overview effect from earth","story":"Researchers aim to recreate intense emotional experience astronauts reported on seeing Earth from space for the first timeThe spectacle of Earth suspended in space was so overwhelming for Edgar Mitchell that the Apollo 14 astronaut and sixth man on the moon wanted to grab politicians by the scruff of the neck and drag them into space to witness the view.Such drastic measures may not be necessary, however. Scientists are about to welcome the first participants on an unprecedented clinical trial that aims to reproduce the intense emotional experience, known as the “Overview effect”, from the comfort of a health spa.If the trial goes well, what led Mitchell to develop “an instant global consciousness” and a profound connection to Earth and its people could be recreated with nothing more than a flotation tank, a half tonne of Epsom salts, and a waterproof virtual reality (VR) headset.“There’s a lot of ision and polarisation and disconnection between people,” said Steven Pratscher, a psychologist and principal investigator on the trial at the University of Missouri. “We’d like to see if we can recreate the Overview effect on Earth to have an impact on those issues.”Pratscher will recruit about 100 volunteers who are willing to don the VR headset and clamber into a dark, salt-laden flotation tank at the city’s Clarity Float spa. The silence and buoyancy will mimic the sensation of floating in space, while the VR headset plays high-definition, 360 degree immersive video recorded by the Silicon Valley startup, SpaceVR.The volunteers will be randomly assigned to have either the full flotation tank VR experience, to float without VR, or have VR while lying on a bed. Before and after their one-hour session, the participants will complete a series of questionnaires to assess whether they had any mystical experiences, felt more connected to others, or had what psychologists call an “emotional breakthrough” moment. The persistence of any effects will be assessed after one week and again a month later.Pratscher does not expect everyone who steps into the tank wearing a VR headset to emerge having experienced the Overview effect. But the experiment will reveal what, if anything, people do experience when their senses are fooled into believing they are looking down on Earth from space.“It may be able to elicit, to some degree, these mystical experiences, and I’m curious to see if they have persisting effects, for example on people’s values and behaviours, especially with respect to how people view the Earth and the environment, and the things they do that may impact the environment,” Pratscher said.“We’re causing potentially irreversible impact on the Earth, so hopefully it will wake people up to see that there are more things we can do to help save the planet, protect the environment, and live in more harmony,” he added.Not all astronauts experience the Overview effect, but those who do describe a number of factors that appear to fuel the phenomenon. On seeing the whole planet in the blackness of space, national borders melt away, and we all become, primarily, citizens of Earth. Many astronauts are struck by the thinness of the atmosphere, and the stunning beauty of the planet, and feel compelled to protect it when they return.“For me it was an epiphany in slow motion,” said Ron Garan, a former Nasa astronaut who is not involved in the trial. “It’s a profound sense of empathy, a profound sense of community, and a willingness to forgo immediate gratification and take a more multi-generational outlook on progress.”Garan, a former fighter pilot, flew on space shuttle Discovery in 2008 and spent two weeks working on the construction of the International Space Station. The trip created a longing to go back and in 2011 he launched onboard a Soyuz rocket on a six-month mission to the space station.“From space, the planet is a constantly changing masterpiece and the sheer beauty is absolutely breathtaking. It looks like a shining jewel and you realise that it’s home to everyone who ever lived and everyone who ever will be,” he said. “But another thing that hit me was a sobering contradiction between the beauty of our planet and the unfortunate realities of life on our planet. It filled me with a sense of injustice. It infuriated me.”On his return, Garan wrote The Orbital Perspective, a book about the call to action he felt after experiencing the Overview effect. It is about seeing the big picture, appreciating what needs to be done, and cracking on with solutions. He believes it might be possible to at least produce what he calls an “aha” moment with VR on Earth.“You can be sat up there in orbit thinking about this contradiction and then realise you’re sitting on the answer. The answer is that humans, when they set aside their differences and work together, can do anything.“You want people to have that shift in perspective, to think planetary. You want them to come out and solve problems in context of the real world in its entirety, to solve multi-generational problems, not slap band aids on things,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf93b306a89bf7f06e9483a4b424c2dc3b74d0b/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae57b64c2892a76a51bdfe2b1442cd1","title":"sadiq khan urges pm work with him to end rough sleeping","story":"London mayor speaks at Christmas Eve event for 100 homeless people at City HallOne hundred homeless people spent Christmas Eve afternoon at City Hall in London, where the mayor, Sadiq Khan, said society was letting down those without homes.Amid the festive cheer of the first ever such event – where Khan helped serve a three-course lunch of smoked salmon, roast turkey and pear tart before many took to karaoke – people spoke of their struggles accessing services and the omnipresence of drugs, as well as opportunities to gamble, on the streets.“You’re made to scream for help and unless you do that it doesn’t come,” said Scott, a 45-year-old who slept in a park for a year. “You have to fight tooth and nail for what you are entitled to.”Now, however, he has his own flat – after being helped by the charity St Mungo’s. “I was lucky,” he said. “It takes most people about four years, if at all. We definitely need more social homes built. They want to move you on from the hostels but they can’t.”Cherelle, 30, explained how she was evicted from her housing association home for falling into rent arrears while she was sectioned, and lived in a cupboard at a housing block before being forced to move on.“There was no safety net, being mentally ill and addicted to drugs, it’s a double-edged sword,” she said. “You’re always fighting a battle. You’ve got to be at rock bottom before someone says here’s a hand. Rather than being able to ask for help before you get to that point.”She is now living in one of the St Mungo’s accommodation centres, along with many others of those at the event – none of whom is still sleeping rough. However, some have had to move to other boroughs away from their support networks to get a roof over their head.Almost 9,000 people were seen sleeping rough in London by outreach workers last year, more than double the number in 2010-11, according to the mayor’s office.Rough sleeping has also more than doubled across England and Wales over the last decade, and there is growing public concern. Churches, libraries and other buildings in Bradford, Newcastle upon Tyne, Derry and elsewhere were opened on Tuesday to provide Christmas dinners for homeless people.Next to the River Thames at City Hall, while people watched the seasonal film Elf and played Jenga, Khan called on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to work with him to end rough sleeping.“I don’t pretend today is going to solve all these problems, it’s about giving some vulnerable Londoners a special experience at this time of year to raise awareness about these issues, and to give people hope that we can end rough sleeping once and for all,” he told the .The mayor said he has persuaded councils to provide shelter to all rough sleepers when temperatures approach zero in any borough in London.Downing Street has announced an extra £63m in funds to help tackle homelessness, but Labour said it was “too little, too late”. Khan blamed a lack of social housing, an unfit-for-purpose private rental market and social care cuts as well as the “disastrous” universal credit system for helping to drive increased homelessness.“I say merry Christmas to Boris Johnson, congratulations on the general election victory, but let’s work together to solve this,” he said. “I think we are judged as a society by how we treat the most vulnerable and we’re letting them down.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e68679245119eb12012d9d9112ef1615bd7e5dcb/0_200_3813_2288/master/3813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75b5186b37d36211812f9b9cb889160b","title":"boxing day test first day match report","story":"Steve Smith conquered his short-ball issues to hit his first half-century of the summer and help Australia to 257-4 on Boxing Day against New Zealand. Smith went to stumps unbeaten on 77 after a gripping day of Test cricket, where Australia claimed the honours in front of a bumper crowd of 80,473 after being sent in to bat.The right-hander took himself into the top 10 of all-time Australian run-scorers, having played less Tests than all above him. After a low key opening half of the Test summer by his lofty standards, Thursday’s knock was a return to Smith at his best as he played with great control. Out to bumpers and New Zealand’s legside field twice in Perth, Smith wore several balls on the body and ducked his way out of others at the MCG. Fighting hard, he rarely pulled\u0026nbspthe quicks and when he did he hit them along the ground. He also drove tremendously at one stage he hit spinner Mitchell Santner back over his head for six. If Smith reaches triple figures on Friday, he will become the first player to score centuries in five straight Tests at the MCG.Travis Head will start day two alongside Smith, getting through a tough period against the second new ball to go to stumps unbeaten on 25. It came after Marnus\u0026nbspLabuschagne chalked up a half-century for the fifth innings in a row before being bowled for 63.Already the leading run-scorer for 2019, Labuschagne is yet to be dismissed for less than 50 this summer and has passed the milestone in nine of his past 12 innings. His 83-run third-wicket partnership with Smith was crucial in giving Australia control, after they found themselves in dangerous waters early as the Kiwis grabbed two wickets before lunch.However, Labuschagne was unfortunate\u0026nbspin his dismissal as he left a ball from Colin de Grandhmme (2-48) that hit his elbow and fell onto the top of his off stump.After tongue-in-cheek claims of bodyline in Perth, where Australia’s top six fell to short balls in the second innings, no Australians were out to bouncers on Thursday. But the Black Caps still troubled the hosts with the kind of movement that has been missing from the MCG in recent years.Left-armer Trent Boult (1-60) produced an absolute peach to bowl Joe Burns for a golden duck in the first over, swinging it in at the right-hander and nipping the ball back between bat and pad. David Warner edged Neil Wagner (1-40) in the opening session with his feet stuck on the crease, allowing Tim Southee to take a one-handed stunner at second slip. Matthew Wade also edged behind, nicking one from de Grandhomme that swung in at him and cut away from the medium-pacer.The wickets brought the MCG to life with thousands of Black Caps fans rejoicing and enjoying their team’s first Boxing Day Test in 32 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b38dc24b85784b14bc9dee4871d6d6dd2871687/0_267_5046_3028/master/5046.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be77aaad191ca2954848ddc22514bbd0","title":"jaw dropping sport moments 2019 japan scotland rugby world cup","story":"And what did you hear in the silence that fell over Yokohama Stadium before kick-off that Sunday night? Grief and sorrow, yes, for the wounded and dead, pain, pride and defiance, surely, and hope, too. Whatever it was, exactly, that all those Japanese fans and players were thinking about in that short minute, you could at least be sure of this – it all felt foreboding for the Scottish team lining up next to them. The Scots wanted this match, which both teams needed to win. They had rowed and shouted about it, and roped in lawyers to give them advice about their rights if it was cancelled, and now it was here, at last, as scheduled, and they were about to find out just how much Japan wanted it too.The morning after typhoon Hagibis had been as bright and clear as the days before it had been confused and uncertain. The meteorologists had been warning it might be coming for a week, but hadn’t been able to say for sure exactly where or when it would land, or how strong it might be when it did. World Rugby had imagined they were ready whatever. They said they had been working on their contingency planning. But now, faced with the prospect of sorting new venues and accommodation for hundreds of players and staff, ticketing and travel for tens of thousands of fans, in the face of the worst storm in 60 years, they found there wasn’t much they, or anyone else, could do.“The risks are just too challenging,” said tournament director Alan Gilpin. They decided they had to cancel the two matches slated to be played on the Saturday, England v France, and New Zealand v Italy, this last the hardest decision since it meant the Italians were bound to be knocked out, but made easier, they suggested, by the difference in the two team’s standings. There were four more games scheduled for the Sunday, Namibia v Canada, USA v Tonga, Wales v Uruguay, and the crucial final fixture, Japan v Scotland. They would take a view about those on Sunday morning, once it was clear how bad the damage was.Scotland worried. “It would be very unusual for a World Cup in any sport to be decided by a game being called off on one day,” Gregor Townsend argued. His boss, Mark Dodson, the chief executive of the SRU, was even more emphatic. “For World Rugby to simply state that the game has to be cancelled goes against the whole sporting integrity of the tournament”, Dodson argued. “We’re not going to let Scotland be the collateral damage for a decision that was taken in haste.” There were mutterings about legal action. His words were wildly misjudged, and the SRU were later fined £70,000 for them.Japan’s head coach, Jamie Joseph, returned fire. The Japanese don’t often go in for public displays of anger, but Joseph didn’t hold back. “They’ve undermined the achievements of the Japanese national team,” Joseph said. “I think the key difference here between us and Scotland is we are driven and supported by the whole country. My team is motivated by achieving something that is great - not avoiding an embarrassment.” That was on Friday. By Saturday morning the streets were quiet and the supermarket shelves empty, by the afternoon, the trains had stopped running, and the city was at a standstill.When they finally finished counting the missing, they found that 95 people died that night, and over $15bn worth of damage was done, some of the worst of it in the country around Yokohama. As soon as it had passed, the Japanese had workers out in the stadium, clearing away debris, pumping floodwater out of the changing rooms, getting it ready for the night’s game. By mid-morning, the roads were clear and the trains were running, the police and medical services had given the go-ahead, by midday, the match was on, and by the later afternoon, the first of those 70,000 fans were starting to arrive.Scotland scored first, a fine try, made by Finn Russell with a step and fend, but that spurred Japan on, again, into some higher realm. For the next 30 minutes they played at a level that was above and beyond anything the Scots were capable of, and which would have been a match for any other team in the tournament. They weaved dazzlingly intricate patterns, the ball flickering back and forth as fast as thought while they pressed irresistibly down field, in Kotaro Matsushima’s hands one second, Kenki Fukuoka’s the next, Shota Horie’s the one after, on and on, through Michael Leitch and Timothy Lafaele and Pieter Labuschagne. They scored four dazzling tries in 26 dizzying minutes, and won 28-21.Japan’s motto for the World Cup was “One Team”, because the way they had pulled together such a erse group of players, from so many different backgrounds and countries – 16 of their squad were born overseas. Japan had already beaten Ireland, but this was the night the phrase became something more than another slogan. “This game was about more than just us,” explained their captain Michael Leitch after it was over, and his team had reached the quarter-finals for the very first time. “A lot of people suffered in the typhoon for this game to happen.” Japan, you guess, will never look at its rugby team in quite the same way again, and nor will anyone else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd56b82e618c10cf2f6f80ff8258f091788e53b4/0_49_4644_2788/master/4644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627a52158bbbeaffaadf82772880e6e4","title":"king george vi chase and boxing day racing live","story":"There will be a big name missing from tomorrow’s Kempton card too as Altior, whose unbeaten record over fences finally came to an end when he was beaten by Cyrname at Ascot in November, will miss his intended run in the Desert Orchid Chase due to a foot abscess.Altior would have been sure to start at long odds-on for his return to racing at around two miles, the trip at which he compiled a 19-race winning streak over hurdles and fences.It has been a damp start to the day in south-east London and a somewhat disappointing one too following the news that Thistlecrack, last year’s runner-up, has been scratched from the King George VI Chase due to a bruised foot, reducing the big-race field from six to just five.Thistlecrack was a 16-1 shot and no forlorn hope to add a second King George to his memorable success during his novice season in 2016, but even in his absence, this still promises to be a fascinating renewal of the Christmas showpiece with four of the five remaining runners priced up in single figures.It is not even possible to say with any certainty whether Cyrname or Lostintranslation will set off as the favourite, and the rain that is forecast for the Sunbury area later in the day could well see punters swinging behind Lostintranslation, currently the 2-1 second-favourite, as Cyrname (11-8) has yet to prove his stamina at today’s three-mile trip.Clan Des Obeaux is also going to attract plenty of support, not least from those who still have warm memories of backing the 20-1 winner last year, even though Harry Cobden, his rider 12 months ago, has opted to ride Cyrname instead. And then there’s Footpad, an outstanding two-mile novice in 2017-18 but a disappointment since until a return to something like his old form in a weak race at Thurles last time.All that remains now is to see how much of the forecast rain actually arrives at the track. All the predictions are that this year’s King George will be a wet one, with around 5mm expected between midday and six o’clock. The going is currently soft, good-to-soft in places but if the forecast is anywhere close to correct, it is unlikely to be any better than soft all over by the time of the big race.

Turned down, rightly. du Plessis plays out the maiden.24th over: South Africa 79-3 (du Plessis 14, van der Dussen 4 ) A four for van der Dussen - a forthright dispatch to the rope of an over-pitched Christmas pudding from Broad. That’ll settle the nerves. Merry Christmas!  writes Matt Wilson. “I was hoping you could settle a long standing argument between two of my friends. One claims that Francois du Plessis got his nickname of ‘Faf’ because it sounds a bit like five, and du Plessis sounds a bit like ‘two plus three’. The other says Faf is a common nickname for Francois. Do you know which is correct?Matt, I’m sorry but I don’t know. But I bet there’s an OBO reader out there with the answers at their fingertips...23rd over: South Africa 75-3 (du Plessis 14, van der Dussen 0 ) Ah that Centurion Sky! Pure forget-me-not blue. du Plessis kisses Anderson through gully for four, the debutant van der Dussen at the other end. 22nd over: South Africa 71-3 (du Plessis 10) So Broad grabs a wicket and England chip away, despite not dominating in the way the scoreboard might suggest. Some reckless shots from South Africa this morning. Apparently Broad had not bowled a ball this tour because of sickness, and was this morning taking his kit out its plastic packaging as he hadn’t yet opened it. The ball after a pitch-perfect, head over knee, cover drive, Hamza pushes outside off stump and is caught shin-high by Stokes at second slip. What a shame, he was batting beautifully, showing, as Michael Holding had just pointed out, until that moment, perfect judgement outside off-stump. 21st over: South Africa 64-2 (du Plessis 10, Hamza 33) The pitch is mottled beige and mossy green and looks dry. Just two from Anderson’s over, as Hamza casually turns the last ball off his hip.Sam Hey wonders why England are wearing black armbands. It’s in memory of Bob Willis, Sam, who died just over three weeks ago.20th over: South Africa 62-2 (du Plessis 9, Hamza 32) A double change, as Broad takes the ball back from Sam Curran. He’s on the money, just short, just wide of Hamza, twice on a crack, and Hamza two balls in a row flirts in cheap lace. He does well to survive.Leon Wylie wins email of the session. “1st ball in a boxing day test. It has to be a “Turkey”.19th over: South Africa 62-2 (du Plessis 9, Hamza 32) Ah, Anderson is back, somewhat surprisingly, as Archer was producing the occasional gem against du Plessis. Perhaps Root didn’t like the run leakage. Anderson varies his length nicely, and that’s a maiden. 18th over: South Africa 61-2 (du Plessis 9, Hamza 31) Just a couple for du Plessis as Curran keeps it tight. There’s a good crowd at Centurion, lots of shade, lots of short-sleeves, lots of ice-creams.John Westwell drops us a note before heading off for a bracing walk on the beach. “ I’d suggest that Angel Delight is much more deserving of the term ‘devil’s food’ than Christmas pudding. Only a fallen angel (ie Lucifer himself) could find that powdery triumph of marketing palatable.”Very true, though butterscotch instant whip had its place in the 1980s kitchen.17th over: South Africa 59-2 (du Plessis 7, Hamza 31) An eventful over. Two heavenly drives from Hamza as Archer goes full, through the covers, then back down the ground. Then he shrugs up some extra bounce from nowhere and du Plessis is up on his toes fending the ball away past slip for another four. 16th over: South Africa 45-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 22) A maiden from Curran, varying the length, varying the line, but du Plessis is equal to it, his bright pink bat handle flashing in the sun.Dave Seare is back from the kitchenI did a quick sweep of the kitchen and it’s a vitamin c-free zone this morning. Still undecided, I’ve had a bit of cheese to help the thought process.It’s a good sign that South Africa are keen to help England out with some gift wickets. Curran is the kind of player that always seems greater than the sum of his parts and makes the team feel better.Your mention of mince pies has given me an idea......15th over: South Africa 45-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 22) Shot of the day from Hamza as Archer drifts short and wide, he throws the bat, and cuts with his Sabatier for four. A finely cut steak, an expensive bitter mint. But Archer in on his case, and Hamza is tempted, so tempted, by one that zips past the edge of his bat. One all. 14th over: South Africa 41-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 18) It’s Curran again after drinks. A short one lobs over du Plessis’ head and is called a wide. No runs off the bat from the over.“In reply to Martin Laidler (over 4) I’m not sure about the universally approved technical term for a first ball dismissal in a series, but am reminded of yesterday’s dinner (aka very late lunch) that included a stuffed, deboned duck with spiced plum glaze. Hence I offer ‘Plum(b) Duck’ (if only it had been lbw)?”13th over: South Africa 40-2 (du Plessis 2, Hamza 18) du Plessis negociates another awkward over, this time from Archer. His best ball is a rising rocket, which du Plessis tickles just past Bairstow ing at short leg. And that’s drinks. Advantage England, with Archer-Curran looking more dangerous than Broad-Anderson. Indeed, Guy Hornsby is reaching for the valediction pills.Jofra and Curran (S) on first change. Two contrasting propositions, both able to make something happen. Just like that! Sam seems so inocuous, but has that edge about him. It feels like a bit of a changing of the guard. I don’t want to deepen those post-Christmas blues but how much longer until we don’t have Anderson and Broad’s mastery to call upon? Even though I’m in my 40s, it almost feels as if they’ve been leading the attack for ever. Will they both make the Ashes? Who knows, but we’ve been honoured to have them. 12th over: South Africa 36-2 (du Plessis 0, Hamza 16) Curran is trouble this morning, giving du Plessis a Boxing Day work out. He starts the over wide, then has him poking to slip and finally beats du Plessis with a 138 kph screamer. A heavy-weight, booze-laden mince pie disguised as angel delight.11th over: South Africa 36-2 (du Plessis 0, Hamza 16) A double change, as Archer replaces Anderson. His loosener is 143 kph, the fastest ball of the day, and Hamza decides to leave it on a length. It laughs as it brushes over the stumps. Hamza clips the last ball of the over through square leg for four. Pudding for breakfast? writes James Debens. What fresh hell is this? A black coffee to kickstart the metabolism, followed by a satsuma or three to cleanse the palate. A satsumaan orange should always be offered to anyone who crosses your threshold, rolled across your table if the guest is South African, of course. The offer of a satsuma rather than a biscuit or, ye gods, a slice of Christmas pudding, shows that you care about your guest’s wellbeing and any potential gluten intolerance they may have.”10th over: South Africa 32-2 (du Plessis 0, Hamza 12) Joe Root has had enough of his elder statesmen and throws the ball to Sam Curran. Immediately, he makes things happen. First Markram thrashes him, wildly, through the covers. Then he edges him just short of slip, Then the wicket, to his fourth ball. Curran’s bowling at 137 kph - faster than Broad, and the same speed as Anderson.Off his hips, straight to Bairstow at short midwicket! What a bowling change by Root. Top marks for field placings too.9th over: South Africa 28-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 12) Anderson has had quite a severe haircut for his return. A maiden, if without quite the zip of vintage JA.8th over: South Africa 28-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 12) The South Africans have very jaunty green numbers on their backs. A not particularly special over from Broad, and Markram and Hamza bat them away without too many problemsMorning Dave!“Came downstairs and saw South Africa batting. Thought ‘poor Root, not much luck at the toss.’ But it seems he forgot about winning the toss, thinking about bowling before having a bat. Brave.Should I have Christmas pudding (the breakfast of champions), a plate of biscuits from a fancy box or get stuck into the Tower ‘o’ Pringles that’s taunting me from the other side of the room?Might just go straight to the Rennies,Cleanse your palate with a satsuma, then perhaps a shortbread or three? Christmas pudding, arghghghg! The devil’s food.7th over: South Africa 25-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 9) Anderson is probing away at Hamza. Atherton points out that you can see a lot of his stumps. It’s hot out there by the way, up in the early thirties, and humid.6th over: South Africa 24-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 8) Broad reasserts some control with a maiden. Hamza is one to watch.5th over: South Africa 24-1 (Markram 16, Hamza 8) A flurry of runs as Anderson goes for a most uncharacteristic 11 from the over. Markram dispatches two fours in a row, a wristy swish before throwing himself at a short wide one which flies over the outstretched hand of Root at slip. For dessert, a back foot drive for three. 4rd over: South Africa 13-1 (Markram 5, Hamza 8)  Broad is experimenting, wide of off stump, short and a good length. Hamza gets him away for two, punching him down the ground.3rd over: South Africa 10-1 (Markram 4, Hamza 6) The only bowler with 150 caps runs in, joints as oiled as a seal. A maiden.It’s the time of year, to contemplate the ine on earth. Matt Dony has spotted him, at Centurion. “At what point do we have have to admit that Anderson probably isn’t human, and face the ethical problems arising from that realisation? 37 years old. Fast bowler. Leading the line and Taking Test wickets regularly. It’s not right... 2nd over: South Africa 10-1 (Markram 4, Hamza 6) At the other end, Joe Root throws the new ball to Broad, so in their first match together, Anderson and Archer won’t share the new ball. Ah, that’s a lovely shot from Markram, straight down the ground for four, a gentle caress. Markram has been out with a broken wrist sustained punching a wall after being given out for a duck in Pune.1st over: South Africa 5-1 (Markram (RHB) 0, Hamza 5)Hamza walks out to a gob-struck Centurion, in only his third Test. That was a bit of a shocker from Elgar to an Anderson loosener, a gloved aside to Buttler, the dud joke in the Christmas cracker A typically probing over from Anderson follows.And Jeremy, we have an answer from Anthony Noel (thanks, Anthony) - the coverage of this series is on TalkSport not TMS.Elgar tries half-heartedly to clip Anderson off his hip and Anderson has a wicket with the very first ball of the series!There’s a bit of a delay as someone, a photographer perhaps, seems to have fallen over on the boundary. Anderson waits at the top of his run. Does anyone please have the TMS overseas link for Jeremy Dresner?Something to mull over...but a tasty seam attack for England: Broad, Anderson, Archer, Stokes, Curran.The players walk out for the anthems, and England are wearing black arm bands in memory of dear Bob Willis, RIP. Mike Atherton on  the toss. “All the chat is that this pitch deteriorates at the back end of the game, fine to bowl first but you better damn well make sure you get a first-innings lead.”And a straight-talkin Christmas to you too Mike!Ah, brilliant! We have an expert. Thanks Adrian Goldman.Joe Root has won the toss and will bowl. “It is quite a tricky decision to make but we think it is a great opportunity on this track.”Jack Leach isn’t fit, Ben Stokes is playing, they go in with a five-man attack.Faf du Plessis says he’d have batted first anyway, “On day one the wicket is generally quite slow here, on days two and three it is decent, and then the cracks start to open.”In the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, Australia are on top, thanks to fifties from Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, despite Trent Boult dispatching Joe Burns’s stumps with the first ball of the game. As it happened, here.Gary Naylor is up bright and early. Happy Christmas!That’s a good question. Though I don’t think the jab protects you from every strain of flu - perhaps it is country specific?! Any expertise welcome.Something to digest with your Boxing Day coffee. Since 2010 Vernon Philander has been the best bowler with the Kookobura ball. The second? Kagiso RabadaA couple of stats as Sky warms up - in the last decade, Centurion has been the worst Test ground for spin bowlers. And, this morning, Jimmy Anderson becomes the first bowler to play 150 Tests. Ever. He and Stuart Broad are playing darts with Ian Ward. They talk about bowling with the kookaburra ball. “The balls are different here,” says Anderson. “They’ve got a slightly different seam, it feels harder, you might get ten overs of decent swing. The atmospheric conditions here are good, so are the pitches, you get carry. We’re thinking it is going to be different to how it was in New Zealand.”I hope yesterday was full of good cheer and good people. To those who were unhappy, a virtual hug: come, there’s plenty of space on the OBO sofa. The chocolate orange is on me.Over in Centurion, they’re preparing for the big one - the face off between the bottom and sixth placed sides in the World Test Championship, the first of four Tests between South Africa and England.England gather together their walking wounded after a bout of flu has rampaged through the camp - we wait to see what team they cobble together for the seam friendly Centurion pitch. Early sufferers Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad trained yesterday, but Ollie Pope and Chris Woakes were both missing and showing signs of the lurgy. James Anderson, who missed both the summer’s Ashes series and the tour of New Zealand with a calf injury, is raring to go.Thankfully, Ben Stokes’s father Ged has showed signs of improvement in intensive care and his condition has stabilised, Stokes trained on Christmas Day and was due to make a decision on whether to play overnight.England have lost five of their last six away series, but their last Test series defeat in South Africa was under Nasser Hussain in 1999-2000.South Africa are not in the greatest health. They’ve have a tumultuous six months - off-field boardroom shenanigans, disputes with players, loss of a sponsor, revoking of journalists accreditation, whitewashed in a Test series in India - but now sit with a formidable new top table team: (interim) director of cricket Graeme Smith, coach Mark Boucher and batting coach Jacques Kallis. Team-wise, Temba Bavuma is out with injury, and South Africa are likely to play two Test newbies, batsman Rassie van der Dussen, South Africa’s second-highest run-scorer in the World Cup, and allrounder Dwaine Pretorius. Meanwhile, all-rounder Vernon Philander has announced his retirement at the end of the seriesHope that’s wet your whistle.

And we won’t tell a lie ... in these less innocent times, they are most welcomeIt’s been nearly a decade since we last saw Gavin, Stacey and the rest of the Billericay-Barry massive. It feels like a lifetime ago. James Corden and Ruth Jones’s creation was born in and of a different era. Whether it was of stability or complacency you can choose according to tasteexperiencepolitical conviction, but it can hardly be argued that it wasn’t a more easeful one either way.Even if you weren’t a fan the first time round, travelling back there now in the Gavin and Stacey Christmas special feels like an hour’s respite, sorely needed. And fans will find much to enjoy.Gavin and Stacey have three children now and, while familiarity has not bred contempt, they are in a bit of a rut. Stacey particularly feels the lack of excitement – and sex – in their lives. Not that she isn’t happy with their decision to get kitchen cupboards in the January sales rather than buy each other Christmas presents, you understand.Smithy is still a reliable presence in her and Neil’s life, but his and Ness’s casual hookups ceased when he took up with a new girlfriend, Sonia, nearly a year ago. “I’ve had the odd scrag end tossed my way on the island,” she tells Stacey, with the weary contempt of a goddess stuck too long among mortals. “But that doesn’t even touch the sides.” Smithy is on the verge of asking Sonia to marry him. No one has met her yet. Gavin worries.It is the Welsh contingent’s turn to host the family festivities this year. For Gavin’s mother Pam, this is akin to being asked to spend the night in a stable, so she is busy trying to pack the contents of her immaculate Essex home into two small bags, insect spray, mattress topper, towels, Bear Grylls survival kit and all. They have only to deal with Dawn and Peter’s latest marital meltdown – she has found a spliff in his glovebox and assumed a secret heroin addiction. But because Dawn is played by Julia Davis, the whole scene is invested with such unspoken horrors and suffused with such thick dread before the truth is revealed, it is a wonder we don’t all choke on our own primal fears before it’s done. The woman is a witch.In Barry, Bryn is preparing the meal “for over 13 people!” and putting final touches to his schedule, checking Gwen’s oven dimensions and tracking down the plate-warmer Glenda claims she never borrowed. It’s all go, but we must maintain our faith in Bryn otherwise we have nothing on this earth.There are the traditional array of minor misadventures: Pam forgets to bring the Christmas puddings with her and the replacements from Morrisons are left in the pub, the kids scupper Stacey and Gavin’s attempt to bone, and Bryn incurs an unfair debt of £5 to Dick Powell regarding some bread sauce.Gavin and Stacey’s rutlack of rutting problems are quickly solved by a trip down memory lane – or at least round the island – because their narrative is the main concern in name only. The beating heart of the show remains, as it was always destined to be when two actors write a show, the characters the creators play: Smithy and Ness. After getting drunk in the pub on Christmas Eve, the pair wake up in bed together the next morning. Sonia is due to arrive shortly. Smithy is stricken. Ness tells him nothing happened. Smithy, relieved, sallies forth. Sonia arrives and is awful. Smithy is unrecognisable around her. Ness tells Stacey that they did in fact sleep together. They’re just one of those couples. “We’re like Hall and Oates. Morecambe and Wise. Mel and Sue.” Sonia is baffled and uncomfortable around the gang and opts to head to her parents’ house earlier than planned. Smithy opts to stay. Ness comes out to talk to him as Sonia drives off. I won’t spoil what happens next except to say that it’s a crackin’ ending. Tidy, you might say. Depending on Smithy’s response, I’m not going to lie, potentially very tidy indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0248c3775395ad589046af7d5b47027b43d6c36c/0_265_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8073b95a000b74b7f741f7409c4465b","title":"benjamin netanyahu israeli pm faces primary vote gideon saar","story":"Party rival Gideon Saar has launched a bid to unseat Netanyahu as Likud leaderIsrael’s longest-serving prime minister is poised to face one of his most dangerous political challenges in a decade on Thursday when the ruling Likud party holds a leadership primary to decide who will lead it in the next election.The internal vote arrives at a particularly fraught time for Benjamin Netanyahu, wounded by three damning corruption indictments as well as growing internal dissent over his failure to score decisive wins in two inconclusive national elections.Most alarming for the 70-year-old leader is a public challenge from a Likud party favourite, Gideon Saar, who broke ranks this month to launch a leadership bid. While his chances of replacing the party’s most successful ever leader are still seen as low, the veteran politician’s short campaign has gathered rapid momentum.Calling for a “renaissance” of the Israeli right, Saar has focused on Netanyahu’s inability to form a government, a failure that has tipped the country into months of political paralysis. An unprecedented third national election is set for 2 March.“He (Netanyahu) has failed twice, but it is not because of the Likud’s ideas,” Saar said as he launched his campaign. “If we do not make a change, we are getting close to a leftwing government,” he warned as supporters chanted: “Only Saar can!”Despite his outwardly restrained manner, the former interior and education minister has often been pegged as the next Likud leader. His is talked about excitedly in rightwing circles by those who see him as quietly capable.In an apparent attempt to woo Netanyahu fans – but ones who are hankering for change – Saar promised on Monday to push to get the prime minister appointed as Israel’s next president.The 52-year-old former lawyer and journalist was brought into politics by Netanyahu two decades ago. But he left in 2014 for five years after tensions rose between him and the prime minister, who saw him as a threat. Last year Netanyahu accused Saar of orchestrating a coup against him.In October, after another muddied election and as Netanyahu’s legal woes began to snowball, Saar openly challenged him – a rarity in a party known for fierce loyalty – with a single tweet. When Netanyahu suggested he would consider a leadership battle to firm up his mandate, Saar responded on Twitter: “I’m ready.”A staunch nationalist, Saar is seen as even more hardline regarding Israel’s continuing control of the Palestinian territories, but within Israel’s domestic politics, he is considered pragmatic.Vitally, many think Saar could forge a deal with the opposition Blue and White party if the March election delivers a similarly uncertain result, as polls have predicted. Blue and White’s leader, the former army chief Benny Gantz, has ruled out joining a coalition with a prime minister under indictment but not other Likud figures.Netanyahu and Saar have toured the country this week to rally support. Israeli media predict a solid win for Netanyahu, although Saar has gained backing from a handful of Likud lawmakers and hundreds of activists.The stakes could not be higher for Netanyahu, both professionally and personally. Charges against him include fraud, breach of trust and bribery, which could lead to jail time. If he retains the role of prime minister, Netanyahu is not legally obliged to step down from public office and could use his position to push for immunity.Netanyahu has denied all allegations as a “witch-hunt”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bac1948a13ac6379d34d7404a0e4f7c5184192/1061_0_4621_2773/master/4621.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a73ae799fbbc38e0aed6ece641144cb5","title":"cctv installed at karl marx grave in highgate cemetery","story":"Cameras intended as vandalism deterrent after it was twice defaced this yearSurveillance cameras have been installed in Highgate cemetery to watch over the tomb of Karl Marx after it was vandalised twice this year.The CCTV devices have been mounted on two tree trunks either side of the Grade I-listed monument. Meanwhile, a marble plaque that was severely damaged in the attacks, in January and February 2019, has been removed for restoration.The decision to install the cameras was made by the Marx Grave Trust, which owns the monument, after consultation with security experts and Historic England, the public body that oversees the country’s built heritage.The Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, which was also involved in the decision, said Marx’s grave is the first in the cemetery to be surveilled by cameras. The move is designed to deter vandals, including the uncaught suspects who carried out both attacks earlier this year.Visitors to Marx’s tomb had not noticed the newly installed cameras until they were pointed out by the .“It is a bit freaky that they are there,” said Frank, a tourist from just outside Berlin, who was visiting the cemetery with his wife Jana. As a boy, Frank was involved in a project to clean Marx’s tomb during a visit to London from his home in what was then East Germany. “It is sad that it is thought necessary,” he said, nodding towards one of the cameras.“In Germany this wouldn’t be possible,” Jana said, referring to Germany’s restrictive laws on CCTV cameras. “You see them in some public places, but never in a cemetery.” Neither Frank nor Jana wanted to give their surnames.Marx himself never advocated surveillance, but he inspired regimes that exercised unprecedented surveillance over their citizens in the name of his communist ideas. George Orwell’s 1984 satirised such regimes with a dystopian vision of a society that was spied on day and night by the all-seeing and all-powerful Big Brother.Jean Seaton, a professor of media history at Westminster University and director of the Orwell prize, said Orwell would be amused by cameras watching over Marx’s tomb.“You can imagine the Orwell humbug eyebrow going up. He would find it funny that even a grave is now subject to surveillance,” she said.Seaton added: “It is wonderfully ironic that Marx, the great outsider, has to be protected in this way as an inidual – because that is what the grave represents. All the statues of Marx that have been knocked down were of him as an idol, but the tomb at Highgate represents him as a human. For all Marx’s influence, the uniqueness of iniduals is still something that we hold very important. It’s why we find the desecration of gravestone so appalling and such a taboo.”The plaque damaged by vandals dates back to the original 1883 gravestone for Karl Marx and his wife Jenny von Westphalen. It was incorporated into the current tomb under a bust of Marx when it was constructed in 1954.In the first attack in January vandals were suspected of using a hammer to damage the text of Marx’s name. In the second attack in February they are thought to have used a bigger hammer to damage the text. In the second attack they also daubed the monument in slogans painted in red including “doctrine of hate” and “architect of genocide”. The police were informed of both attacks but subsequent investigations were limited because there were no witnesses or forensic evidence to identify the suspect.The damaged plaque has been temporarily replaced with a photographed facsimile while it is being repaired.John Briggs, from Solihull, who was visiting Highgate cemetery for the first time, was disturbed by the vandalism. “You should be allowed to rest in peace, whatever your political views,” he said.But he didn’t mind the cameras. “They don’t trouble me, they are just a fact of life now.”Asked if he shared Marx’s views, he said: “I wasn’t happy with the election result, but I’m not a Marxist.”Adam, another visitor who didn’t want to give his full name, questioned whether the cameras would prevent more vandalism. “They’re not really much of a deterrent. They could be lights or even bird boxes. If you wanted it to be deterrent you’d need a sign saying it was CCTV but that probably isn’t right in cemetery.”Ian Dungavell, the chief executive of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery Trust, confirmed that as the owners of the monument, it was the Marx Grave Trust that chose to install the cameras. He said: “They are discreet but not invisible and intended as a deterrent. If people are worried about the security of their graves we are always happy to accommodate them.”He also revealed there were plans to put up notices to alert visitors to Marx’s tomb that they were being filmed. The Marx Grave Trust has not responded to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e900c27ebdfd1eccfdf8b33703c50ab1595043bd/0_515_4696_2817/master/4696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e760c14daea270471888ec588d66669","title":"erdogan arrives in tunisia for surprise talks with president","story":"Turkish leader’s visit comes as Ankara moves to strike deals with Mediterranean nationsThe Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has arrived in Tunisia on a surprise visit for talks with his Tunisian counterpart, his office has said.The visit, the first by a head of state since the Tunisian presidential elections in the autumn, comes as Turkey has ramped up efforts to strike deals with nations on the Mediterranean, where Ankara has been at odds with Greece over resources off the coast of the ided island of Cyprus.Last month, Turkey signed a maritime delimitation agreement with Libya’s internationally recognised government, a move that enraged Greece. Athens says the deal violates international law, but Ankara says it aims to protect its rights in the region and is in full compliance with maritime laws.In a statement, Erdoğan’s office said he was accompanied on Wednesday by his foreign and defence ministers, as well as his intelligence chief. Erdoğan said he had discussed with his Tunisian counterpart, Kais Saied, possible steps and cooperation to establish a ceasefire in Libya.At a news conference alongside Saied, Erdoğan said he believed Tunisia would have “valuable and constructive” contributions to creating stability in Libya, and added that a ceasefire must be established as soon as possible.The visit is the first by a head of state to Tunisia since the election of Saied in October, after parliamentary elections.As part of its expanded cooperation with Tunisia’s neighbour Libya, Ankara also signed a military cooperation deal with Fayez al-Sarraj’s Tripoli-based Government of National Accord.Erdoğan has said Turkey may deploy troops in support of the GNA, which has been fighting off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar’s forces to the east of the country.On Tuesday, the presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey may need to draft a bill to send troops into Libya, adding that parliament was working on it.

Mary Inman, a partner at the law firm Constantine Cannon, said the £642,000 fine imposed by the UK City regulator last year on the Barclays chief executive, Jes Staley, for trying to unmask a whistleblower has triggered a surge in business for companies that provide whistleblowing programmes.“Jes Staley handed them all a big gift,” Inman said, adding that it forced companies to think: “Wow, we’d better take these things seriously.” She said: “It was a huge reputational issue.”Staley apologised for trying to unmask the whistleblower, who raised concerns over the bank’s hiring of the chief executive’s friend and former colleague. The Barclays boss used the bank’s internal security team and a US law enforcement agency in an attempt to track down the author of letters that flagged worries about the hire.Alongside ever evolving regulatory requirements and the rise of the #MeToo movement, the incident helped spark a rise in demand for firms such as whistleblowing consultancies and dedicated call centres that collect tip-offs and complaints. They compete with software firms that build secure inbox software and online chat channels, offering digital alternatives to telephone hotlines. Finally, to follow up on whistleblower intel, contractors will investigate complaints or train up internal staff to do the same.But their services do not come cheap. Costs range from about £1,000, which may cover a basic programme audit for a small firm, to as much as £100,000 for annual software licence fees billed to a complex multinational business. Andrew Samuels, who helped build the whistleblowing programme at Barclays bank, launched his own whistleblowing consultancy, Addveritas, in 2016 after noticing a gap in the market. The consultancy founder says whistleblowers need to be seen as “assets rather than liabilities” who can offer information that will help retain staff, prevent fraud and protect profits. But it is important to take the time and join the dots. “Something that seems quite innocuous at the start can end up being a lot more sinister,” Samuels warned. He cited one example in which a whistleblower’s persistent concerns over unsanitary conditions in an office led to the discovery that contractors called in to deal with the problem were defrauding the firm, via a company insider. Addveritas has competition from established rivals, including EY and Deloitte, which offer services ning consultation and investigations. There are also call centres, secure inbox creators and chatroom “portals” run by firms including EQS, WhistleB, Expolink and Whispli, founded by the whistleblower Sylvain Mansotte.Mansotte uncovered a A$20m (£10.3m) fraud scandal at his former employer, the Australian miner Leighton, which put one of his former colleagues behind bars. But Mansotte was originally put off by the thought of leaving a tip on his employer’s staff hotline, worrying that his French accent would give him away.That concern spawned the idea for Whispli, which offers a digital inbox and online chatbox that generates new identities for every whistleblowing report. Those reports cannot be traced back to the employee until they are comfortable coming forward, he explained.The company – run by about 20 staff, with offices in Australia, the US and France – is raking in annual licensing fees of between £10,000 to £100,000 per client. “It predominantly depends on the number of countries you’re plugged into, the number of languages you need,” he said.The whistleblower-turned-entrepreneur estimates that the wider industry is worth as much as $2bn in the US and $4.5bn globally – and investors are taking notice.Whispli, for example, is expecting to raise more than $10m in its next funding round. Another player, Navex Global, which owns the whistleblowing portal called EthicsPoint, was snapped up by the private equity firm BC Partners last year in a deal that valued the firm at $1.2bn. A separate US competitor, Convercent, has attracted about $80m in funding since 2013.Whistleblower lawyer Inman says the space is getting crowded. “They seem to show up at a lot of compliance conferences – they all have booths and they’re all selling something. So I think it’s a big industry that you’d expect would crop up as soon as all the Fortune 500 and FTSE 100 companies need to have these gold-plated whistleblower programmes.”She expects most companies to make a beeline for “plug and play” products, such as anonymous hotlines, that are quick and easy to use. But the real work is building a corporate culture that encourages and supports whistleblowing across the business.“It’s a cultural change that needs to happen. And what needed to happen in Barclays was the tone from the top,” Inman said. “We really need to mean it when we say: ‘We want to hear from you about problems.’”Enron Sherron Watkins, a former vice-president at Enron Corp, tried to warn her bosses of a massive accounting fraud only months before the world’s biggest energy firm collapsed into bankruptcy in 2001.Olympus The Olympus president, Michael Woodford, uncovered a £1bn accounting fraud at the Japanese digital camera firm in 2011 after flagging suspicious payments made in the course of corporate takeovers. It led to the conviction of three former executives.Danske Bank Howard Wilkinson, who served as the head of Danske Bank’s trading unit in the Baltic region until 2014, blew the whistle on an alleged €200bn (£178bn) money-laundering scandal at the lender. HSBC Hervé Falciani, an IT specialist, exposed wrongdoing at HSBC’s Swiss private bank, which allegedly turned a blind eye to tax evasion and money laundering by account holders. He fled from Switzerland to France in 2008 with a list of 130,000 names of organisations and iniduals who were using secret Swiss accounts and handed them to French regulators.

Thousands were stranded at shuttered ports or evacuation centres while others sheltered in rain-soaked homes as Phanfone crossed from one island to another for the second day.The typhoon toppled houses and trees and blacked out cities in the Philippines’ most storm-prone region. More than 10,000 people spent the night in schools, gyms and government buildings hastily converted into evacuation centres as the typhoon made landfall on Tuesday, civil defence officials said.“It was frightening. The glass windows shattered and we took cover by the stairs,” said Ailyn Metran after she and her four-year-old child spent the night at the local state weather service office where her husband worked. The family returned to their home in Tacloban city on Wednesday to find their two dogs safe but the floor was covered in mud and a fallen tree on their house.More islands lay in Phanfone’s projected path towards the South China Sea.More than 25,000 people trying to get home for the traditional Christmas Eve midnight dinner remained stranded at ports on Christmas Day with ferry services closed, the coast guard said. Scores of flights to the region also remained cancelled, though the capital Manila, on the northern edge, was being spared.Phanfone ravaged the north of the island of Cebu overnight on Tuesday, and residents decamped from evacuation centres only to find their homes damaged, civil defence official Allen Froilan Cabaron told AFP.“They were safer at the evacuation centres. At least they were able to eat the Christmas Eve meal there, even if only tinned fish and instant noodles were available,” Cabaron said. “Obviously, they were unable to celebrate Christmas properly because some spent the night at evacuation centres,” rescue official Cecille Bedonia said from Iloilo city.At the western island resort of Coron, the beaches emptied and boat tours were suspended as Western tourists stayed in their rooms to await the typhoon onslaught later on Thursday.“Many of the tourist establishments here are closed, and some of our guests failed to arrive because their flights were cancelled,” hotel receptionist Nina Edanosaid. “We’re not scared, but the ambience here is generally gloomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1468ec32e2df3020a758c848b949b7b79d1e8c9/0_170_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e17659e75fbf93477b97459f4c4c5d6","title":"help us locate benin bronze statues in the uk","story":"We would like to start locating these objects and mapping their journeys to Britain – and we need your helpJesus College Cambridge has agreed to return a Benin bronze statue to Nigeria, after it was taken by British colonial forces from the country in the late nineteenth century.The artefact is set to be one of the first Benin bronzes returned to Nigeria, after thousands were stolen from Benin City in a punitive 1897 expedition by British forces.The decision to return the artefact comes after increasing scrutiny of the origins of our museum collections, and a growing movement to repatriate objects taken from former British colonies.Objects in national collections including the British Museum and the V\u0026ampA cannot be returned to their countries of origin because they are protected by the Heritage Act.

The strictly- imposed rules also mean there can be only one other sales period in 2020, and that, like the post-Christmas sales, can only last four weeks.France. Now that is a country where sales are very tightly regulated to protect smaller retailers who struggle to compete with the internet and big multinational fast-fashion chains that can buy in bulk and offer deep discounts almost year round if allowed to better lure people through their doors.It is a lot more laissez faire in this part of the world, and the very notion of a winter sale has been dramatically distorted in recent years.Irish retailers and overseas retailers that dominate our town centres and the centres out of town seem to be forever in sale. The winter sales last until spring, just ahead of the start of the mid-season sales, which are followed by the summer sales and then more mid-season sales. Then there are the Black Friday sales, followed by the pre-Christmas sales, before we hit the post-Christmas winter sales again.Sale signs are being prominently displayed in windows in all our cities’ main streets. The season of goodwill has been forgotten by many as antsy shoppers elbow each other out of the way in the race to get at the bargain-basement frocks, trousers, shoes and tops.But not everyone is convinced that we are better off as a result of all the sales.Retail expert Eddie Shanahan says the era of the perpetual sale is not doing us any favours, and is as a result of a lose of expertise in the retail sector.He suggests that it began before the start of the recession when the country was “dramatically over-shopped”. He says all sorts of people who had nothing in common but a lack of retail experience began opening shops of all kinds.“Then the pressure came on, and they found themselves overstocked. And the only way to stay open was to have sales and give away their margins at times that were traditionally when they could expect the best trading, particularly in the run-up to Christmas.”The early sales in some shops put pressure on other retailers to follow suit, and suddenly the dominos started falling. And they have kept falling.He says the “art of retail has been damaged” in recent years, and many of those in the business have lost the ability to offer real service.“It is not all about price, and I think the bigger challenge in retail is customer service. But I don’t think many retailers nowadays are equipped to meet that challenge.”In the run-up to Christmas, Shanahan carried out a quiet experiment in Dublin. He went into more than 40 shops in the city centre on a single day, and only once did a member of staff say good morning to him or otherwise acknowledge his existence as he came into their shop.“A lot of staff today are on zero-hour contracts, and don’t give a monkeys about customer service. They don’t have ability to upsell either. And you have to remember upselling is really an offer of help“Too many shops have lost the ability to retail, and in many instances they have replaced it by deep discounting. And discounting is nothing if it is not desperation because you are giving away your profits. It is the last resort of people who don’t really understand how retailing works.”Shanahan also doubts that perpetual sales are what consumers actually want anymore.“We are living in an era where sustainability is the buzz word, and when it comes to sustainability the most important thing is to buy better. We have to stop buying discounted rubbish.”He suggests that much of the stock that will be on sale in the days and weeks ahead is “a mistake”.It is either evidence of a mistake by retail buyers who over-estimated the level of demand for certain lines or by manufacturers who overproduced stock and find themselves forced to sell it at a deep discount to retailers, who decide to sell it at full price for a couple of weeks before a sale period kicks in so they can reduce the price and create the impression they are offering bargains galore.“We have to look at the big picture. If consumers are more concerned about sustainability they’re going to switch off buying stuff and it won’t matter what the price is. Value is not simply about price, and the clever retailer knows that.”JP Kennedy of Retail Excellence Ireland says too many periods of deep discounting have been putting enormous pressure on many retailers.“As a result of the recession a lot of retailers were panicked and were much quicker to go into sale, and that created an expectation amongst many consumers.”He believes the era of the perpetual sale “makes it very difficult for smaller and medium-size Irish retailers to have a sustainable business”, and says that when he talks to members of the retail umbrella group “many of them say they won’t be feeling very happy over this Christmas”.He expresses concern that too many sales and too much discounting could lead to a “hollowing out of towns and villages because of what is an unsustainable playing field. If you have five or six sales periods a year it can damage retailers on the cusp of sustainability.”He says ultimately consumers will have to decide what they actually want. Do they want cheaper clothes offered to them six or seven times a year or would they rather sustainable businesses were allowed to operate in a more normal business environment?Maybe it is time the Government here stepped in and mimicked what is happening in France.In spite all the shopping and the changing that extended periods of deep discounting brings, the big winter sale still remains a big deal for many thousands of people in Ireland.It doesn’t really matter that the Dundrum Town Centre or Arnotts or BTs and all the rest of the retailing giants last had a sale three long weeks ago, there will still be people hauling themselves out of bed at ridiculous o-clock of the morning just so they can stand in queues in the cold and rain to get a half-price mattress or fridge.But how can you be sure you stay ahead of the crowd, bag the best bargains and don’t end up with a chronic case of buyer’s remorse? By following our tips to help you make the most of the days ahead, that’s how.1. We have said this before and we will say it again, something is only ever worth buying in the sales if you actually need it and will get real use out of it. That gold Prada suit might be down from €2,000 to €400, but if you don’t need a gold Prada suit or won’t wear a gold Prada suit or if the gold Prada suit is two sizes too big and makes you look ridiculous, then you are wasting your money buying it no matter what the size of the discount. End of story. So before you spontaneously buy anything in the sale ask yourself if you need it and if you will wear it. If there is even the slightest doubt, leave it back.2. The next best piece of advice we can give you before you go shopping is to suggest you forget all about spontaneity. Before you hit the shops ask yourself a hard question. What do you actually need when it comes to clothes, shoes, appliances and all the rest. Don’t even consider buying things that you don’t need. You’ll thank us for this advice come the middle of January when you are not being haunted by your credit card bills.3. When it comes to the list you are making, don’t leave it in your head. Write it down. List all the things you are in the market for. Put the list into your phone, and then refer to it repeatedly throughout your day in the shops to help keep yourself in check. Unless shoes are on the list then don’t buy the shoes.4. By our reckoning there are two really good times to shop in the sales – and neither of them are without problems. If you have the stomach for it go shopping early on the first day but not too early. Pricewatch has been in Dublin city centre at 8am on St Stephen’s Day for work purposes on more than half a dozen occasions over the last decade or so, and while the bargains change there has been one constant. That is the absence of queues. Don’t get us wrong. There are some people standing in line outside the big retailers. But the numbers have never – at least in our experience – climbed above 50. So time it right, get there just as the shops open, and you can get all the things you need within an hour.5. If you shop early, go home early. Do not hang around the shops as the morning of December 26th turns into the afternoon. The crowds become hideously unmanageable, and the whole experience will be very unpleasant. So shop like a ninja, buy what you need, and then get the hell out of Dodge.6. The next best time is when the sales period is drawing to a close. At the tail-end of the sale the reductions become a whole lot more dramatic as retailers grow more desperate to shift their unwanted stock, so this is where you can make the best savings. This plan works best if what you’re after is unlikely to fly off the shelves or if you noticed a whole lot of the product you want in the sale on day one. It is also ideal for somewhat oddly-shaped folk as irregular-sized clothes are the slowest to sell.7. The best way to find the best value in the sales is to ignore the low-value stuff and concentrate all your spending on big-ticket items. We’re talking about for shoes, fancy coats and pricey handbags. They always cost more so the discounts will be worth more, and the items will last longer and be less likely to fall victim to the whims of fashion. You will also find big discounts on televisions and white goods. But, again, only get the stuff if you actually need it.The good news is that even if you ignore all our advice and do lose the run of yourself in the sales in the days ahead, you won’t lose your rights as a shopper. But do you know what those rights are?Over the course of the coming days there is a good chance you will come across signs which say things like “No money refunded”, “Only credit notes given” or “Sale goods not exchanged”.These signs are meaningless, and very possibly illegal. Retailers often put them up not because they are trying to pull the wool over your eyers, but because they themselves have a poor understanding of the law and the protections it offers shoppers.The thing is it really doesn’t matter if you pay full price or get a discount of 95 per cent on something you buy in a shop, you still have the exactly the same rights as a consumer.That is to say you have the right to expect a product to be of an acceptable standard, fit for its intended purpose and as advertised. If it’s not you will be entitled to a repair, a replacement or a refund – despite what any signs might say.It is important to remember that some of the things you take for granted at other times of the year will change during a sale period. A lot of good shops have very generous returns policies and allow you to exchange goods within a set time frame of purchase simply because you have changed your mind. Sometimes they will give you a credit note, sometimes they will give you your cash back. They are under absolutely no legal obligation to do either.Many retailers are likely to suspend those kind-hearted polices during sale periods – and that is their right – so don’t be shouting at shop assistants if they refuse to entertain your refund requests over the next couple of weeks.The change in policy is is perfectly understandable. If a shop has managed to flog you the three-piece tuxedo with a leopard print trim that has been taking up space on its racks since the 1970s, then it cannot be expected to take it back just because you have changed your mind and seen sense.If you are returning something bought in the sales because it is in some way flawed – and not because it is a three-piece tuxedo with a leopard print trim and you are suffering from a serious case of buyer’s remorse – remember you do not need a store receipt. Legally all that is required is proof of purchase. That can take many forms, including credit card receipts or bill, or a cheque stub. Although we can’t imagine that many people pay for anything by cheque anymore.When you are returning an item because you think it is faulty make sure you go into the shop armed with the facts. You cannot expect it to give you a refund and you generally speaking have no right to one.You have a right to a repair, a replacement or a refund, but the retailer gets to chose which of them is offered.Always stay calm and stand your ground when discussing a problem, and remember that a shop assistant or store manager is not qualified to assess a fault and dismiss it. If they try to to do that you have the right to insist the product is returned to the manufacturer, where people are better placed to assess the cause of flaws.While you can make a shop send a product back to the manufacturer, it cannot insist that you deal directly with the manufacturer. As a consumer your contract is always with the seller of the goods, although you are perfectly within your rights to go directly to the manufacturer with a problem if you so choose.If the price of something on the shelf is less than the price eventually quoted at the till, a consumer does not have an automatic right to buy the product at the lower price. The price on the shelf is what is known as an invitation to treat, and no contract is actually in place until money changes hands.We asked Twitter users for the best – and the worst - bargains they have ever got in the sales. Here are just some of the responses.Set of 4 LeCrueset pots in Arnotts. Think they were priced incorrectly at £105 for all of them. Still going strong 20 years later.

Picked up some great bargains there over the years. Emma RyanFor 51 weeks a year we highlight the woes of readers and where possible try and right wrongs which previously may have seemed intractable. Sometimes righting those wrongs takes us seconds.That is not because we or any better at picking up the phone or sending emails than our readers, it is because companies hate bad press and they will act fast to counter it. So when The  calls, companies do what they should have been doing from the start and they take their customers’ concerns seriously.Of course, people should not have to come to us to help them with what can be so easily fixed when the will is there.But seeing as it is Christmas we thought we’d leave all the rancour behind and highlight the good news stories we have head from readers in recent days. Sadly there are not a lot of them.At a recent meeting in London, Adam Grennan was given a large iced cake to mark his retirement. The plan was to share it with colleagues at the end of the meeting. Unfortunately, due to a late finish, that didn’t happen, and I was left with the option of either donating it to someone else, which was unlikely given it was decorated with several rather embarrassing photographs of me, or taking it back on the flight to Dublin the following morning. While I was mulling this over a colleague found the large box the cake arrived in, and after carefully repackaging it, reassured me that getting it home “would be no trouble”.Next morning my edible companion and I stood in front of the BA desk in London City Airport.“Excuse me, do you think I could take this on as hand luggage,” I said, holding up the rather large cardboard box. “I’m a bit concerned that it might not fit in the overhead luggage compartment.”“It’s a cake…to celebrate my retirement.”“You can take it on if it fits in that,” he said, pointing to a contraption used to check the size of a case.Sadly, it didn’t. It sat on top. I thought of taking it out of the box and cutting it into bite-sized chunks. However, a small queue was now starting to form behind me, and I’m not sure any of my fellow passengers would have been happy to wait in line as I performed surgery on the contents of my baggage.“Could I check it in?” I asked.After consulting my booking, he said: “You haven’t paid for checked-in luggage, sir. If you’d like to check it in now it will cost £65.”“£65,” I said. “At that rate I’d prefer you took it home and ate it.”At this point the man’s supervisor lent in close to remind him that the charge went up the previous day, and a late baggage check was now £75.I began to panic and wondered if perhaps I could just abandon it. Under pressure the best ruse I could come up with was to pay a visit to the gents and leave it behind in one of the cubicles. However, then I thought, this is London and as we’re frequently reminded, unclaimed luggage will be destroyed if left unattended. I had visions of the bomb squad arriving and sponge cake flying in all directions. Besides, I could hardly deny that I was the owner seeing that there were multiple photographs of me stuck to the top.“Just take it up to security,” the BA man said as his supervisor walked away. “If you get through there then ask at the boarding gate. They might check it in for free.”I clambered up the stairs, into the security area and bundled everything I had into the trays. All the usual stuff and one rather large cream sponge cake. I watched as the whole lot was swallowed up by the security scanner.Out came my PC, case and jacket, but no sign of my outsized friend. Moments later one of the security team emerged holding up a large battered, and all too familiar looking, box.Unamused, she asked, “What’s this?”“A cake, a retirement present,” I said.“It got stuck in our scanner,” she said.“Thank you,” I said, as I grabbed it, perhaps a little quicker than I should from a security agent, and sprinted down to the boarding gate and straight up to the young BA attendant standing there.“Excuse me,” I said. “Your colleague downstairs suggested you might be able to check this in for me.”“What is it?” he said.Weary but determined not to be thwarted at this stage, I told my story for the third time. He smiled, as if he knew I was coming, and then, to my complete surprise, passed the baton on.“You don’t want to check that in. Take it on as hand luggage. Ask the cabin staff if they would let you put it on the seat next to you.”I walked out and up the steps to the plane, where I explained my case to yet another BA staff member.Smiling, he said: “Just pop it down in front of the seat beside you. We’re not all that busy this morning.”Later that day my family and I managed to do what I should have done 24 hours earlier – eat the damn thing… and very nice it was too.

It was facing Christmas without his dad that inspired him to invite others into the café. “This is kind of therapy for me,” he said.Emotion ran high through the building as communities gathered together in support of each other. For Nicola Thomas, “that’s what Christmas is about. It’s not about receiving, it’s giving.”Among those who arrived into Thomas and Co was Kevin Slattery who had been sitting in his flat by himself when he found out the café was open.Kevin had been homeless for many years before securing a flat in Oranmore two years ago with the help of the Simon Community.“I have a problem with drink. I find it very hard at Christmas not to go drinking and I usually get in trouble. The Gardaí are at the house or an ambulance is at the house,” Kevin said.However, this year Kevin left his empty flat and walked to Thomas and Co for some company. He said, “I can’t explain what this means. I’m just happy.”For Brazilian native, Anderson Morales, who has been living in Galway for fourteen years, Christmas can be difficult as he has no family here in Ireland.“You find a lot of people like me here,” he said, sitting among strangers conversing. “It kind of brings me a sense of family again.”Throngs of volunteers also arrived into the cafe, making coffees, washing dishes and providing musical entertainment.Gillian Mary Ni Chonbhui, who is a nurse and midwife, travelled from Clare to offer lifts to those who needed them and to provide friendly conversation.Meanwhile, Emma Howard along with her 15-year-old daughter came down to provide healthcare assistance to any elderly people or disabled people.The professional healthcare assistant esaid, “I thought it would be lovely for me to give back. The biggest donation I can give is my time.”An atmosphere of joy and kindness was evident throughout the café as strangers comforted each other and enjoyed donations from local people and businesses in the town.“This is what Christmas is supposed to be,” owner of the cafe, Nicola Thomas said, wiping tears from her eyes. “It’s just amazing to be here and be surrounded by all these people that are here together on Christmas Day.”Any donations which were not used today will be donated to COPE Galway, a local charity which provides support to people who are homeless, those who experience domestic violence, and elderly people."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4123188.1577046156!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"emergency brexit inspection tents in rosslare cost 120 000","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosslare Europort: Tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire Temporary emergency marquees for Brexit checks which never happened have been put up and taken down a number of times over the last year at Rosslare Europort at a cost of more than €120,000.The  has learned that tents were erected ahead of each Brexit deadline this year for use as emergency inspection accommodation in case of a no-deal scenario, as permanent infrastructure has not yet been built.The marquees were originally intended to be installed to cover the ramifications of a potential no-deal scenario in March. They were first put up in anticipation of the March and April 2019 deadlines, and remained in place until June 11th.They were then dismantled as the OPW had no use for them ahead of a new Brexit deadline in October.They were then reinstalled on the October 21st, 2019 in preparation for the October 31st deadline.“They are likely to remain on site until the threat of a no deal passes, or if any changes are indicated following the British elections. On completion of the final phase of development of the new border control post on the site, expected by the end of January 2020, the marquees will be dismantled and returned,” a spokesman for the OPW said.According to the Government’s Brexit Contingency Plan, published in July 2019, infrastructure at ports was due to be “refined” and “improved” after the first deadline passed in March.It said that “permanent state inspection facilities will be constructed on a site adjacent to the existing port”.“This facility will accommodate inspection bays for SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) and food safety checks as well as a number of Revenue turnout sheds. The site will also include office accommodation, a documentary and public office, driver welfare facilities, two documentary and identity check facilities” and parking for 35 HGVs, the contingency plan states.Permanent infrastructureIn response to queries about the cost of the tents, a spokesman for the OPW said that “interim infrastructure was put in place at Rosslare Europort to prepare for a possible no-deal Brexit on 29 March 2019. In the period afforded by subsequent Brexit extensions, this has been enhanced incrementally since then. Permanent infrastructure will be put in place to apply the additional customs, SPS and health checks and controls on a long-term basis”.The OPW said the marquees had a “dual purpose for department staff training requirements and for use as emergency inspection accommodation for use in case of a no-deal Brexit”.The agency says it has already paid €110,400, excluding VAT, for the hire of the marquees with an indicative monthly rate of €27,600, excluding VAT.“The cost of their dismantling, removal from site and reinstallation in October 2019 was €8,500. We were not charged while the marquees were off-site.”A source has told The  that a large fence was also installed and removed at the site. The OPW said the costs for this are not available at this time.“The purpose of the moveable fencing was for site ision and security. Portions of the site were handed over to the client departments for training purposes as they became available. The moveable fencing is necessary to enable our main contractor to proceed with construction works safely, in parallel with department staff training and movements adjacent.“Given the area in question is an active construction site, moveable fencing is in place for the duration of the works for the safety and security of all parties.“The costs for fencing are incorporated into the main contract for the building of the border control post and will be available once the works are complete.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Stephanie LeCocqEPABritain has been unnecessarily damaged by Brexit and “more will follow”, the vice-president of the European Commission has written in a “love letter” to the British people in which he promises a warm welcome back should attitudes change.Frans Timmermans, who is Ursula von der Leyen’s deputy in her role as European Commission president, writes that British scepticism of the EU had been an asset to the bloc as he expresses his own feelings of rejection ahead of the country’s impending departure on January 31st, likening himself to a jilted “old lover.Writing in the , Mr Timmermans, a former Dutch foreign minister who was also deputy to Jean-Claude Juncker, says he first grew to love the UK and the character of its people through his time at a British school in Rome, Saint George’s English School.The British doubts over the European project had offered a healthy check on the more federalist ambitions of figures through the decades, he suggests in his article. He writes: “I know you now. And I love you. For who you are and what you gave me. I’m like an old lover.“I know your strengths and your weaknesses. I know you can be generous but also miserly. I know you believe yourself to be unique and different. And of course you are in many ways, but perhaps less than you think.”Membership“You will never stop referring to the rest of us as ‘the continent’,” Mr Timmermans adds of the British attitude through the decades to EU membership. “It helps you to create a distance you think you need. But it also prevents you from seeing that in fact we all need a bit of distance between us. All European nations are unique. Our differences are a source of admiration, surprise, discomfort, misunderstanding, ridicule, caricature and, yes, love.”Negotiations on the future relationship will start in earnest in March once the UK has formally withdrawn and negotiating positions on both sides of the channel have been confirmed.Boris Johnson has said he will not extend the transition period, during which the UK will remain in the customs union and single market but not the EU’s decision-making institutions, beyond December 2020.Clashes are expected over access to British waters for European fishing fleets and, more significantly, the EU demand that the British government sign up to its environmental, social and fiscal rules in return for tariff-free trade in goods.Mr Timmermans talks of his grief at the unpicking of the relationship built since the UK’s accession to the European economic community in 1973. He suggests that David Cameron’s decision to hold the 2016 referendum was unnecessary.He writes: “You were in two minds about it, like you have always been in two minds about the EU. I wish you had stuck to that attitude – it served you well and it kept all of us in better shape.“Was it necessary to force the issue? Not at all. But you did. And the sad thing is: I see it is hurting you. Because the two minds will still be there, even after you have left. In the process, so much unnecessary damage has been done to you and all of us. And I fear more will follow.”Mr Timmermans concludes, however, that the UK “will always be welcome to come back”. – Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

For that one heart-stopping moment in April, it appeared that Mr Maduro\u0027s socialist dictatorship might be brought down by Mr Guaido, a charismatic young leader whose rise had been backed by the Trump administration.Days later, it all looked very different.  It soon became clear that the military would not switch sides, and a strident Mr Maduro promised to punish the instigators of the foiled coup attempt. To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Comment: It\u0026#39s time to consign the word \u0026#39Brexit\u0026#39 to the history books, and get on with self-governmentKylie Minogue woos Britons in post-Brexit tourism campaign for AustraliaBest of Matt 2019: vote the funniest cartoon of the yearHow the Alnwick Castle Garden is growing drugs to teach children about the perils of addiction UK weather: Boxing Day shoppers set to face heavy rain across countryBoxing Day hunts across the country shake off attempts to tie them up in red tape Murder investigation launched after man \u0026#39shot dead on his doorstep\u0026#39 in BatterseaBoris Johnson\u0026#39s bridge to Northern Ireland might work but the UK would have to pay, says Irish PMAmbassadors go green as Foreign Office replaces petrol official vehicles with electric carsFormer Archbishop of Canterbury warns climate change is the \u0026#39largest challenge\u0026#39 ever faced by humanityAri Behn, former husband of Norwegian Princess takes his own lifeHow Thomas Hardy\u0026#39s feminist fans found inspiration in Tess, the milkmaid exploited and betrayed by the men around herNewly diagnosed cancer patients to be signed up for NHS fitness bootcamps, under radical plans to boost survivalGavin \u0026amp Stacey\u0026#39s Ruth Jones suggests there could be a sequel as show ends on a cliffhangerLondon parks should be allowed to grow \u0026#39scruffy\u0026#39 in order to save nightingales, Darwin\u0026#39s great great granddaughter saysThree members of British family die \u0026#39after drowning in swimming pool\u0026#39 at their Costa Del Sol hotelDuke of York misses Royal family outing to Christmas Day church service at SandringhamIraq war veteran says \u0026#39I would rather go to The Hague than face another two years under UK investigation\u0026#39Police take over drug dealers’ phone numbers and text users in new fight against county lines gangs We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/12/20/TELEMMGLPICT000001944601_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqgsaO8O78rhmZrDxTlQBjdLdu0TL-Cg_AMOUqySXmFgU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"thomas hardys feminist fans found inspiration tess milkmaidexploited","story":"Tragic heroine: Gemma Arterton as Tess in the BBC\u0026#39s 2008 adaptation of Tess of the D\u0026#39UrbervillesShe is not only one of English literature’s most beloved of tragic heroines, but recently discovered fan mail has now revealed that Thomas Hardy’s character Tess of the D’Urbervilles inspired the early Suffragettes.Letters being made public for the first time show that the author won the deep admiration of early 20th century feminist pioneers for his portrayal of women and their struggle for independence.This unexpected side of the novelist emerges in a ‘fan letter’ praising his characterisation of the tragic milkmaid, a young woman brutalised, exploited and betrayed by the men around her while all the time clinging to the hope of a better life.The novel, subtitled A Pure Woman, Faithfully Presented, exposed the sexual and moral hypocrisies of late Victorian society and received mixed reviews on publication in 1892.In 1909 May Sinclair, a feminist and campaigner for the women’s vote who had met Hardy while cycling in Weymouth the previous year, wrote to him praising the book.In the letter she tells him she was re-reading Tess with “more \u0026amp more admiration” and that she thought he had got the the character’s psychology always \u0026amp profoundly right”.Norrie Bugler, who is thought to have provided Hardy with his inspiration for the character of Tess, with her family (L-R Arthur Bugler, Augusta (Norrie) Bugler, Augusta Bugler and Gertrude Bugler)Hardy’s letters, which show him playing a key role in debates of the time – from suffrage to war and vivisection - are being made available online for the first time as part of a collaborative project between the University of Exeter and Dorset Museum.Professor Angelique Richardson,  from the University of Exeter, who is leading the project, says May Sinclair believed that Tess of the D’Urbervilles provided one of the most effective challenges to the sexual double standards of the day.She told The : “Hardy’s advocacy on behalf of women, particularly working-class women, clearly struck a chord with Sinclair.” Professor Richardson says that as a feminist and modernist, Sinclair would have been drawn to Hardy’s insistence that Tess, in his own words, “was no insignificant creature to toy with and dismiss but a woman living her precious life.”While Sinclair was campaigning for women’s suffrage before she met Hardy, she may well have been inspired in her political work by her earlier reading of Tess, adds Professor Richardson.  Sinclair was not the only women’s rights campaigner to write to Hardy. He also corresponded with the writer and suffragette Evelyn Sharp, who edited the newspaper Votes for Women in 1912.Millicent Fawcett, who led Britain\u0027s largest women\u0027s rights organisation, the National Union of Women\u0027s Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) from 1897 to 1919, had also written to Hardy praising Tess shortly after its publication. He replied on April 14, 1892: “I am much gratified to learn that so good a critic as yourself has found interest in Tess — a book which, like so many books, comes far short in its execution of what I had hoped beforehand to make it.” Thomas Hardy (1840-1928), in his study at Max Gate, DorchesterWhen Fawcett asked Hardy in 1906 to contribute to a pamphlet on eminent men’s views on the suffrage, he replied: “I have for a long time been in favour of woman-suffrage. I am in favour of it because I think the tendency of the woman\u0027s vote will be to break up the present pernicious conventions in respect of manners, customs, illegitimacy, the stereotyped household (that it must be the unit of society), the father of a woman\u0027s child (that it is anybody\u0027s business but the woman\u0027s own . . .”Indeed Hardy’s correspondence reveals that he had that year attended a suffragette rally.In a letter to his youngest sister Katharine, he recalled the response of a woman in the crowd to talk of support for their cause from men, writing: “One woman rapped out: We shall have more difficulty in getting the vote than you men had: we have committed the crime of being born woman. (Cheers from the men.)”Replying to his friend Agnes Grove, after she sent him her book in support of votes for women, The Human Woman, he praised her work, stating on November 13, 1908: “I, of course, who have long held that in justice women should have votes, have not needed convincing, though some of your ingenious arguments had not occurred to me.”In December 1908, when Helen Ward, a member of the Magazine Sub-Committee of the National Union of Women\u0027s Suffrage Societies, invited him to contribute to a proposed suffrage paper The Coming Citizen, he replied that he thought that “women are entitled to the vote as a matter of justice if they want it”, but that it was likely to lead to the “break-up of the present marriage-system” as well as”‘social rules of other sorts”.He added: “I do not myself consider that this would be necessarily a bad thing (I should not have written Jude the Obscure if I did), but I deem it better that women should take the step unstimulated from outside.”The 5,000 letters form part of Dorset Museum’s Thomas Hardy Memorial Collection, the largest Hardy collection in the world. Phase one of the Hardy’s Correspondents project has published images and fully annotated transcriptions of 100 letters to the author.Professor Richardson said: “By looking at the letters Hardy received we can see how he had a central place in national and international conversations and networks. He was engaged in intellectual and political debates, and discussion of subjects ranging from science and war to education, feminism and suffrage.”Comment: It\u0026#39s time to consign the word \u0026#39Brexit\u0026#39 to the history books, and get on with self-governmentKylie Minogue woos Britons in post-Brexit tourism campaign for AustraliaBest of Matt 2019: vote the funniest cartoon of the yearHow the Alnwick Castle Garden is growing drugs to teach children about the perils of addiction UK weather: Boxing Day shoppers set to face heavy rain across countryBoxing Day hunts across the country shake off attempts to tie them up in red tape Murder investigation launched after man \u0026#39shot dead on his doorstep\u0026#39 in BatterseaBoris Johnson\u0026#39s bridge to Northern Ireland might work but the UK would have to pay, says Irish PMAmbassadors go green as Foreign Office replaces petrol official vehicles with electric carsFormer Archbishop of Canterbury warns climate change is the \u0026#39largest challenge\u0026#39 ever faced by humanityAri Behn, former husband of Norwegian Princess takes his own lifeNewly diagnosed cancer patients to be signed up for NHS fitness bootcamps, under radical plans to boost survivalGavin \u0026amp Stacey\u0026#39s Ruth Jones suggests there could be a sequel as show ends on a cliffhangerLondon parks should be allowed to grow \u0026#39scruffy\u0026#39 in order to save nightingales, Darwin\u0026#39s great great granddaughter saysThree members of British family die \u0026#39after drowning in swimming pool\u0026#39 at their Costa Del Sol hotelDuke of York misses Royal family outing to Christmas Day church service at SandringhamIraq war veteran says \u0026#39I would rather go to The Hague than face another two years under UK investigation\u0026#39Soul-searching in Venezuela as Juan Guaido seeks re-electionPolice take over drug dealers’ phone numbers and text users in new fight against county lines gangs We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best matt 2019 vote funniest cartoon year","story":"Choose your favourite Matt cartoon to crown the funniest of 2019Chaos is always good for comedy and this year we have had more than enough of it. I\u0027ve tried my best to tell some of the biggest stories of 2019 through my cartoons and, as always, it\u0027s been an honour and a pleasure.

mirrors recently observed\u0026nbspholiday trendThe price of bitcoin has moved up sharply over the last 24 hours, mirroring a trend in recent years to rise in value ahead of major holidays.The market surge took the cryptocurrency above $7,500 (£5,700) for the first time since the start of December, adding $7 billion to its overall market cap.It remains a long way off the highs of around $13,000 over the summer - and the all-time record of close to $20,000 in 2017 - but is a significant improvement from the start of the year, when bitcoin was trading below $4,000.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe seasonal boost was predicted earlier this month, after research from digital currency exchange SFOX\u0026nbsprevealed that bitcoin has experienced positive market movements in the build-up to US holidays.Similar price increases occurred in the run up to the Fourth of July holiday earlier this year, as well as Labour Day in September and Thanksgiving in November.Created with

These altcoins are even more prone to huge price swings than the notoriously volatile bitcoin.Historically this has been a time when traders do look at altcoins and therefore volatility may increase, Marcus Swanepoel, chief executive of London-based cryptocurrency firm Luno, told\u0026nbspThe Independent.Analysis of the latest price increase led some cryptocurrency analysts to predict further gains over the coming days.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM740 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Presenting aCLTaika Waititi’s films always end with the feeling that thingsCLBritish stoicism and grace under-fire are foregrounded in Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the Dunkirk evacuations. Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1840 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken.

Once Upon a Time in HollywoodA helter-skelter ride of a movie, satirical, very witty and showing its director’s immense affection for the B-movie actors, stunt men and hangers on who make up its cast. It’s also a tribute to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie). Who would have believed that a film set just as the Sixties in LA turned sour could be so uplifting? Geoffrey MacnabThe world isn’t scared enough of Scientology, but perhaps itClarisse LoughreyScorsese summons all his sad captains for one last reunion in his magisterial gangster epic. De Niro, Pesci, Keitel and (newcomer) Pacino are all cast in a film as much about friendship, memory and betrayal as it is about corruption in the Teamster union or Mafia violence. GMThis is Pixar’s boldest and strangest animated feature. It takes us deep inside the mind of its heroine, 11-year-old Riley, where her unconscious is shown as akin to a magical theme park emotions like Joy and Sadness feature as characters. Director Pete Docter deals with complex subject matter in a lithe and inventive way, and without too many Freudian hang ups. GMHirokazu Kore-eda is like the Charles Dickens of contemporary Japanese cinema. He tells melodramatic family stories which would seem mawkish if they weren’t so brilliantly observed. Winner of the Palme D’Or in Cannes, this is one of his very best movies – a heart-tugging story about impoverished members of a makeshift family doing everything they can to survive. GMDogtooth is a grim tale of isolation, incest, cat murder andGM740 34. Edge of SeventeenKelly Fremon Craig’s gorgeous if cruelly unrecognised The Edge of Seventeen is deliberately small in plot, with Hailee Steinfeld playing a grumpy teen horrified to discover her best friend is dating her older brother. But it is told with heartwarming urgency, reflective of the heightened, dizzying drama of merely being a teenager.Reclusive New England poet Emily Dickinson, who published only a handful of poems during her lifetime, is brought to life in vivid fashion by actress Cynthia Nixon in Terence Davies’s biopic. She may look like a spinster aunt but Nixon shows us her passion, mischief and her eccentric brilliance. Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha is the definitive film about the quarter-lifeFamous for its scene of Leonardo Di Caprio being mauled by a bear, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s western is part survival drama, part revenge movie. It’s a wilderness tale on the very grandest scale. From the opening massacre to the snowbound denouement, it if full of moments that startle you with their violence and their beauty. GMShot over 12 years, Richard Linklater’s Boyhood is the ultimate coming-of-age movie. It follows main character Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from when he is seven years old until he is a young adult. It’s a testament to the patience and ingenuity of Linklater and to the exceptional work of his cast (including Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke) that the film never feels phoney.

Nolan has a Cecil B De Mille-like genius for orchestrating crowd scenes and working with huge ensemble casts. He combines spectacle with very intimate moments that show the quiet desperation of the soldiers stranded on a French beach with little chance of escape.AW1840 23. Call Me by Your NameLuca Guadagnino’s wonderfully evocative coming-of-age drama, set over a long, lazy Italian summer sometime in the 1980s, is notable for its frank but delicately observed account of the love affair between the precocious adolescent Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and the American academic, Oliver (Armie Hammer), who becomes part of the household. GM It may be animated but few live-action films have captured middle-aged male angst and disillusionment as well as Charlie Kaufman’s Anomalisa. David Thewlis’s exceptional voice work brings an extra, sardonic edge to its portrayal of the businessman on a work trip to Cincinnati. Kaufman captures the man’s vulnerability, boredom and creeping disappointment about the course his life has taken.

No other film has reflected society in the 21st century more succinctly. AWA magical reprieve from much of the queer romance canon,Barry Jenkins is destined to be one of the most important cinematicCLIt could start within a year, said Stephan Beringer, chief executive of Mirriad, a virtual product placement company that has worked brands including Pepsi, Geico and Sherwin-Williams into ABC’s Modern Family,\u0026nbspCBS’ How I Met Your Mother\u0026nbspand the Univision program El Dragon.Streaming services are more likely than traditional TV companies to pull off this specially targeted version of product placement because they have direct access to far more information on their customers. With every click of the remote, viewers tell the services something about themselves, information that can be used to determine which products might appeal to them.This supercharged version of digital product placement is being developed at a time when the marketing business — which bet big on TV commercials for decades — needs new tricks to grab the attention of ad-hating cord-cutters.Beringer, the head of Mirriad, said the current digital product placement technology has been successful enough to suggest that a bespoke version is a logical next step.“Viewers have been educated to look away from advertising,” he said. “But we’re putting something in that contextually makes sense. If you do it well, and it’s not annoying, it can work.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some of the data is collected by the platforms themselves, others by outside data companies. And now streaming services are mulling how to make use of that information to create tailored product placements.“Just like there’s no reason that all viewers of a program need to see the same advertisement, there’s no reason that they all need see the same brand integration or crossover campaign,” said David Schweidel, a marketing professor at Emory University.Streaming platforms are trying out other advertising innovations, too. Hulu, a platform controlled by the Walt Disney Company, has ads that appear when a viewer hits the pause button. Last week, it rolled out specialised ads for people who are bingeing on three or more episodes of a show, with commercials for Kellogg’s, Maker’s Mark and Georgia-Pacific.This year, Walmart-owned streaming service Vudu enabled so-called shoppable ads on internet-connected televisions. With a click of the remote on the words “Add to Cart,” customers are able to drop an advertised product into their Walmart queue.On the Roku Channel, a streaming channel on the company’s digital media player, viewers can click on certain commercials to request an email or text with details about the product on display. Roku, which spent $150m\u0026nbsp(£115m) this fall buying software provider Dataxu to help companies plan and buy ad campaigns, then shares insights about the audience with the company behind the ad.Created with Sketch.

In another scene, a phone’s broken screen suddenly appears fixed.“Consumers are so much more empowered today to flip the dial, to change the channel, and many of the things they could switch to don’t have advertising at all,” said Scott Rosenberg, a senior vice president at Roku. “It’s incumbent on platforms and apps that are ad-supported to work harder at how they put ads in front of the consumer.”Virtual product placement companies like Mirriad and its rival Ryff said they are talking with streaming services about using data to customize product placements to viewers. Mirriad and Ryff would not name their potential partners.Product placement is appealing to streaming services because it allows them to work with companies without interrupting a show with commercials. Hulu, which comes in a low-cost ad-supported version and also has a commercial-free option for subscribers willing to pay more, said that so-called brand integrations on its platform have been far more effective than 30-second commercials at raising viewers’ interest in products.Some skeptics say virtual product placements based on viewer preferences may turn out to be one of those innovations that does not catch on. A few well-placed TV commercials and billboards are likely to reach the same number of people with less trouble, said Joe Maceda, an executive at the media agency Mindshare.“It’s hard to know if the juice is worth the squeeze,” he said.The possibilities of inidualised product placement were on display in Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspan extended installment of the Netflix series Black Mirror,\u0026nbspa speculative fiction show that specialises in horrifying tales of invasive technologies and exploitative digital companies.Bandersnatch was interactive. Viewers determined how the story, set in 1980s Britain, unfolded by clicking on choices presented to them at various forks in the narrative road. Early on, the film asked viewers to choose between two breakfast cereals, Sugar Puffs or Frosties. Their selection determined which one would appear in a commercial shown on a TV set in the background of a scene later in the film.The most hilarious product placements in cinemaSugar Puffs and Frosties were not included as part of an ad, Netflix said, but rather as a way for the Black Mirror\u0026nbspcreators to enhance the film’s 1980s setting. Netflix was not paid by the cereal companies.But all those remotes clicking on one cereal or the other provided Netflix with data on its subscribers’ preferences. Reed Hastings, Netflix chief executive, cited Bandersnatch\u0026nbspduring a webcast timed to an earnings report this year. Holding up two boxes of cereal, he announced that 73 per cent of Bandersnatch viewers had selected Kellogg’s Frosties.The other executives on the webcast chuckled.“The most critical data point of the quarter!” joked Spencer Wang, a vice president.Netflix, which does not run commercials, said it would not use the information it had gleaned from Bandersnatch,\u0026nbspsaying in a statement that “the privacy of our members is a top priority.”But marketing executives like Ricky Ray Butler, chief executive of product placement company Branded Entertainment Network, are enthusiastic about the possibility of inserting brand-name products into streaming shows based on data generated by interactive programming. Actually being able to do so, he said, may still be a long way off.“The world’s not ready for it yet,” he said. “We’re just at the tip of the iceberg.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Disruption in the first few weeks of university life, which is already a stressful period, was made worse.\u0026nbsp“This left some students feeling unsettled and isolated which made it difficult to find friends.”Durham students put into temporary accommodation days before arrivingMeanwhile, in Portsmouth a group of students were placed in hotels a 30-minute drive from the university following delays to private accommodation at the start of term.\u0026nbspSome students in the city have been moved three times – and a few are still in temporary rooms three months after the start of term, Helena Schofield, president of Portsmouth Students’ Union, said.\u0026nbspShe added: “It has affected their studies as they have spent a lot of time emailing private companies and it has been really unsettling and distressing for them.”The rise in students affected by building delays this year comes amid huge expansion across universities.Competition between universities to recruit students, who pay up to £9,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population at a time when student numbers at institutions are uncapped.Kate McIntosh, president of the students’ union at Durham University, where 108 students were placed in temporary accommodation this term amid delays, said: “At the university, and in the sector as a whole, there needs to be serious questions asked about where student welfare comes into the conversation when we’re talking about building works and expansion.“The university is committed to expanding and building new colleges but at the first hurdle they have fallen because they’ve had over 100 students not in their bed at freshers’ week. It is a complete failure.”The data, obtained by\u0026nbspThe Independent, shows that universities have offered students fruit hampers and supermarket and laundry vouchers to make up for accommodation delays.\u0026nbspBut the National Union of Students (NUS) says institutions need to do more. Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at NUS, said: “There should be mandatory compensation. It is not really a gift if you are giving someone laundry vouchers when the flat they were meant to have had a washing machine.”She told The Independent: “A lot of universities are trying to abdicate their responsibility of accommodation for students. They act like it’s only private providers problems.“Universities are making a lot of money from the fees students are paying but they are not putting that money into building the infrastructure to support the number of students they are then going to house.”Student plans commute from Amsterdam to Bristol amid housing shortageMs Crossan Jory added: “Universities need to realise it’s not just a person sitting in a classroom – it’s all that goes along with moving to a new city or town and having to live somewhere.”In October, universities minister Chris Skidmore urged student accommodation providers to come together to ensure “failures” did not happen again following reports of delays across the UK.\u0026nbspA Universities UK (UUK) spokesperson said the organisation was aware of the issues and challenges surrounding student accommodation and was “working to address them”.The spokesperson said: “To address some immediate challenges, particularly around consumer protections, we need to explore where strengthening regulation can help and make clear where responsibilities lie for accommodation quality and welfare.“It is important that all providers – whether the accommodation is university-owned and managed or run by private sector organisations – meet high standards, demonstrate value, take into account the mental health and wellbeing of students and are accountable to students.”Mr Skidmore said: “Students pay significant amounts for accommodation and housing can affect student welfare.“That is why providers who fail to complete projects on time – and provide adequate alternative provision – need to be held accountable.“With the number of students expected to rise sharply due to demographic changes in the 2020s, we must sharpen our focus on how we will deliver and regulate student accommodation in the years to come.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell.

Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets?

Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining.

They say – especially young kids – they say, ‘I just saw you on the movie.’ They don’t see me on television as they do in the movie.“I was a little younger, to put it mildly,” he added. “It was an\u0026nbsphonour\u0026nbspto do it.”He continued: “It turned out to be a very big hit, obviously. It’s a big Christmas hit – one of the biggest. So it’s an\u0026nbsphonour\u0026nbspto be involved in something like that.

No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship. (RO)1950 32) Vampire Weekend – Father of the BrideAlready subject to manic shifts in style and tempo, this hour-long LP roams in lounge pants from Deadhead jams to Zombies-catchy hooks, infectiously kitsch prog, highlife samples and – on “Sunflower” – a scat breakdown. An unfashionable record, then, and that may be its best asset. With such low stakes and barely any emotional intensity, Father of the Bride won’t cement Vampire Weekend’s legacy. But after a highly strung decade on the indie-rock A-list, it gives them room to breathe. (JM)“Making this album has allowed me, for the first time, to find compassion when I have been at my most ungraceful, confused and fractured,” FKA twigs writes in the album’s press notes. “I stopped judging myself, and at that moment found hope in MAGDALENE.” At times, MAGDALENE is just as ungraceful, confused and fractured as its creator was – a rush of baroque electronics, industrial noise, opera, synths, autotune and precarious falsetto. The follow-up to 2014’s LP1 is the sound of a woman teetering on the brink of collapse, gathering herself, and then erupting into a kind of defiance. (AP)2150 30) Bill Callahan – Shepherd in a Sheepskin VestBill Callahan returns after six years with this homely, career-best album in which he sings of his own contentment. “The panic room is now a nursery,” he observes on “Son of the Sea”. Death still looms – often in the form of a black dog that follows Callahan around various tracks – but its inevitability seems more of a comfort than something to be feared: “Everybody must walk the lonesome valley,” he sings firmly. “Yeah, they must walk it by themselves.” (RO)Arriving three years after the release of her debut, Nothing’s Real, Shura’s excellent second record is camp and theatrical, pivoting between a big, poppy sensibility and a minimalist, lo-fi one – sometimes on the same track. Lead single “Religion (U Can Lay Your Hands On Me)” is a slinky shoulder roll of a song, laden with passionate blasphemy: “I wanna consecrate your body, turn the water to wine, I know you’re thinking about kissing, too.” It’s laced, too, with piano – an instrument she’d always been “allergic to” before this record – and opulent orchestral strings. (AP)2350 28) Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date. Single “Ready to let Go” is by far the most explicit – a moody swamp-rock jam where Shultz comes to terms with his impending orce. He bares his soul on Social Cues, and apparently shakes off a few demons in the process. (RO)Howard listened to Brazilian artist Jorge Ben – “where there’s literally, like, 18 different things happening in the song” – while she was making the album, and it shows. “13th Century Metal” builds like an alarm, while “Baby” is scatty and scattered, like something off The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Sometimes, there is one instrument too many, but usually the components crash together well. (AP)Written during her recent pregnancy and the birth of her first child, Remind Me Tomorrow shows Van Etten dimming her spotlight on toxicity and instead casting a warm glow behind the record’s psychic overview. As well as expectations of confessional singers, she subverts folk music’s focus on bare-bones songwriting. But the daintiest composition “Stay” is her most perfectly realised yet, over music box chimes and heel-clicking percussion she coos: “You won’t let me go astray You will let me find my way.” After years of making peace with drift and uncertainty, she’s never sounded more sure of anything. (JM)Inspired by the improvisations he was creating while on tour with The xx in 2017, Sam Shepherd found himself making “some of the most obtuse and aggressive music I’ve ever made”. This newfound drive can be heard in singles such as “LesAlpx”, a mind-melting track that climbs breathlessly towards its summit with a pounding bass beat and high, whistling chirps that punctuate the tension. It’s an insight into his brilliant mind and – such is the sheer variety of the album – a way to inspire one’s own imagination. (RO)2750 24) Stormzy – Heavy is the HeadThere are three themes that run through the record: his defiance in the face of doubt the pressure of high expectations and his efforts to lift others up as his success continues to grow. He reminds himself constantly of who he is beneath the gloss that fame has brought: he’s “Rachael’s Little Brother”, “Big Michael”, a guy who likes to watch Avengers and Game of Thrones. All of his best traits are present and correct: sincerity, a smooth flow and forensic-like analysis of societal ills, laced with pathos and humour. The lasting impression is of an artist whose only way is up. (RO)A blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals. Songs such as “All Night” are so candidly carnal it feels inappropriate to listen to them in public notes of riot grrrl, pop and rock come together throughout the record to create something that is, at times, quite striking. (AP)2950 22) Solange – When I Get HomeThe decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)For her fifth studio album, Cate Le Bon went to live in a secluded cottage in the Lake District, where she sang to an empty house and took lessons in wood-carving. Yet her compositions on Reward are lush, warm and whimsical opener “Miami” is resplendent with stately horns and percussion that reminds you of childhood. There’s a fantastic sense of space, too, spun from diaphanous arrangements such as “The Light”, where she meanders delightfully from a clear, lilting call to a deep vocal rumble. It’s an album by an artist intent on readdressing her relationship with her own existence. (RO)Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (RO)Swift’s sixth album Reputation was camp and melodramatic, killing off “the old Taylor” and waging war on anyone and everyone who dared to criticise her. It was sincerity veiled as self-parody, insecurity veiled as breeziness – and all the better for that uneasy paradox. But Lover, her new, seventh album, feels like a partial resurrection of the Swift of old: moony romance and earnest earworms abound. It’s the sound of a singer excited to be earnest again. Taylor Swift is dead. Long live Taylor Swift. (AP)The record is an introspective mix of psychey soul, blues, rock and funk, which skips and strolls and swaggers through its 13 tracks – but it is not simply an exercise in nostalgia. Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. The debut solo album of the art-punk pioneer was never going to be predictable, easy-listening. No Home Record channels the dissonance and avant-garde vibe of New York’s experimental no-wave movement in a nine-song, genre-defiant collection that jumps between industrial, minimal electro-rock and abrasive art punk. Uniting the tracks is their creator’s restlessly questing, non-conformist spirit. It’s great to have her back. (EB)Nilüfer Yanya isn’t down with the “wellness” industry. On her debut album, Miss Universe, the singer-songwriter makes this perfectly clear, tearing into all those “improve yourself” schemes littered across social media and parcelling up that angst as cerebral, skewed alt-rock. ​Synths and saxophone play their part on the smoother, more soulful “Paradise” and “Baby Blu”. Listen to the driving groove of “Heat Rises”, meanwhile, and you’ll be instantly reminded of Kelis and Andre 3000’s “Millionaire”. That said, Yanya is very much her own artist: original and bold. (PS)Five years since their last album, the Ohioan duo have gone back to basics. Gone are the subtle inflections and lacquered psychedelia of Turn Blue Let’s Rock is all about simple hooks and nagging choruses, “an homage”, in the words of drummer Patrick Carney, “to the electric guitar”. Get past the terrible title, and you’ll be rewarded with a viscerally entertaining album that never lingers for more than four minutes per song. If this is genre pastiche, it’s genre pastiche done with skill and savvy. (PS)450 47) Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsMusically, Lost Girls couldn’t be more Eighties if it were playing a Commodore 64 while eating Angel Delight. Like Stranger Things, everything about it is unashamedly nostalgic: the power drums, the moody atmospherics, the arpeggiated synths. Close your eyes and you can practically see Jason Patric on the Santa Cruz boardwalk in The Lost Boys​. Yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. (PS)On his debut album, the 24-year-old mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto. On the lustful “Hell Song” he sings “less is more… but more is good”. You’re inclined to agree with him. (RO)When the Missouri singer broke out in 2014, she became known for her lo-fi, introspective sound and the staggering range and power of her voice. On All Mirrors, she dials things up even further than 2016’s Sixties-leaning My Woman, and turns her focus outwards – it is an album, she says, “about losing empathy, trust, love for destructive people” and “owning up to your darkest side”. It is also balletic and haywire, refusing to follow traditional rules of song structure. Listening to it feels like accidentally pressing play on two songs at once, and finding the combination strangely inebriating. (AP)750 44) Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouThis is a polished, playful album, though it has a DIY edge to it: “S**t, f**k, I didn’t know it was ending right there,” she chuckles in the final few moments of “Like a Girl”. “Girl, run this s**t back,” she says after a vivacious flute solo on “Tempo” – a song featuring a guest verse from Missy Elliott, the person who, Lizzo said on Twitter, “made this chubby, weird, black girl believe that ANYTHING was possible”. (AP)There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums. The result is a quintessentially London record, as dark and moody as it is brash and innovative. “We used to do young and stupid,” Skepta concludes on “Gangsta”. “Now we do grown.” (IM)It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (HB)The Chicago-born singer’s ninth album is a furious reaction to the social and political events of 2018 – over 11 breathless tracks, he turns that anger into a howl of resistance. Each song feels personal yet relatable – the deep-rooted despair felt on “Trauma” at the sight of wealthy bullies rising to power is a universal one, as is the sense of liberation in just letting go on “What Can You Do But Rock n Roll”. Twelve Nudes is Furman’s most urgent and cathartic record. (RO)On his studio debut, YBN shows off his versatility, but not to the point that it distracts from the underlying message of each song. You have the menacing “Broke as F***”, where the beats and stark piano hook contrasts with Cordae’s rags-to-riches rap. Aged 21, the North Carolina artist flecks songs such as the Anderson .Paak-featuring “RNP” with an endearing kind of nonchalance over the woozy, psychedelic soul of opener “Wintertime”, meanwhile, he wonders how Corretta Scott King felt upon learning Martin Luther had cheated on her. It’s by no means a perfect album in the grand sense of the term, but it is a perfect demonstration of everything Cordae is capable of. (RO)Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs. The album’s deathly intrigue is drawn from her own personal traumas, which she successfully spins into something that feels universal. But you don’t come away from this record feeling downcast. It’s more a reminder of how fleeting yet beautiful life is, and an appeal to make the most of it. (RO)1350 38) Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (EB)Few people have had as big a year as Billie Eilish. The first – and currently only – artist born in the Noughties to have a US number one single, she also released her double platinum debut album, the innovative and multifarious, if irksomely titled, When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go? There are some missteps –  “Wish You Were Gay” being one of them – but for the most part this is an album as full of charm and bite as Eilish herself. And with a melody that ducks and es in between the beat like a bank robber dodging lasers, the dark, dank pop-trap masterpiece “Bad Guy” is surely a contender for song of the year. (AP)One of the biggest new rap stars to emerge in 2019, AJ Tracey’s variety and the scale of his ambition on this album is breathtaking. Fans will be surprised to discover he sings almost as much as he raps, in pleasingly gruff tones. Each track is a standout, none more so than “Ladbroke Grove”, a hat-tip to classic garage in which Tracey switches up his flow to emulate a Nineties MC. It’s a thrilling work. (RO)The former Chairlift frontwoman’s solo debut (at least, her first under her own name) is an eccentric, experimental delight – PC music by way of classical pop. The product of a orce and a series of adrenal rushes she refers to as “pangs”, the album is musically agile and often lyrically stark: Sometimes I wonder Do I love you too much? Then I tell myself ‘Caroline, shut up’”, she sings on “Caroline Shut Up”. Polachek’s voice is her secret weapon – so jolting and elastic she had to prove it wasn’t autotuned in an astonishing Twitter video. (AP)Simpson recently said he wanted Sound \u0026amp Fury to “hit like a Wu-Tang record”, so each intro is like a one-two punch loaded with brilliant hooks. Then there’s the rollicking “A Good Look” and “Last Man Standing” – it’s pure rock and roll: sleazy, slick and lots of fun. Sound \u0026amp Fury marks another milestone for a remarkable artist. (RO)Of all the excellent bands to emerge out of Dublin’s booming music scene over the past few years, Fontaines DC are the best of them. Perhaps it’s the fact that they’re technically outsiders, having grown up on the borders of the city (or in their guitarist Carlos O’Connell’s case, between there and Spain). Frontman Grian Chatten eschews punk’s tradition of valuing shock value over songcraft and instead offers searing, literary observations of a city with which he has a lovehate relationship.

Its influences  decades Gil Scott-Heron, Fela Kuti, Kendrick Lamar and Bobby Womack are all recalled. “I’m not going to have an alter ego, or becomes Sasha Fierce or Ziggy Stardust,” says Kiwanuka. “I can just be Michael Kiwanuka.” With an album this good, it’s hard to argue with that. (AP)On his sixth album, Kano’s powers of observation are at their peak. Home has always been at the heart of his music, so he maintains the close-quarters perspective of his 2005 debut Home Sweet Home the swaggering confidence of that record, though, is replaced by a more thoughtful gravitas. He’s an elder statesman of grime, and you can almost see his furrowed brow and shake of his head on “Trouble”, while the frenetic “Class of Deja”, starring fellow veterans D Double E and Ghetts, reminds the listener how he lit the path for future generations. (RO)3550 16) Hot Chip – A Bath Full of EcstasyLyrically, the band offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date on this – their seventh and best record. Second single “Hungry Child”, a trance-y floor-filler, contains the plaintive, “Dreaming never felt so bad Lonely never felt so wrong before” while, over the shuffling beats of “Echo”, Alexis Taylor sings of leaving your regrets behind while seeming to understand the effort required to achieve this. For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor’s idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul. (RO)3650 15) MUNA – Saves the WorldSaves the World should see MUNA joining the ranks of those who have brazenly borrowed their sound. Lead single “Number One Fan” banishes intrusive thoughts – “Nobody likes me and I’m gonna die” – just in time for a lavish, self-celebratory chorus, one part earnest, one part tongue-in-cheek. Elsewhere, they are downright defeatist, laments the inevitable pull back to a recent ex (“Stayaway”) or reflecting on a lover’s similarity to an adulterous father (“Taken”). “Hands Off”, meanwhile, toys with temptation before slamming the door shut. It is fierce and forthright. (AP)Fans have already drawn comparisons between We Are Not Your Kind and Slipknot’s seminal 2001 album Iowa. While the latter was even heavier (it would be difficult if not impossible to outdo), the sheer ambition on We Are Not Your Kind is just as staggering. If anything, the dynamic created by placing a bigger emphasis on melody allows you to consider everything without being engulfed by noise. Critics may question how relevant Slipknot are in 2019. The pummelling force of We Are Not Your Kind should be enough to silence them – this may be one of the band’s most personal records, but the rage they capture is universally felt. (RO)Each song is titled after a black woman Rapsody admires: Serena Williams, Sojourner Truth, Maya Angelou, Aaliyah, Oprah Winfrey… and for each one she explores these women’s traits, successes and strife. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as “Afeni”, are pure soul. Nina Simone said an artist’s duty, “as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times”. This is precisely what Rapsody has done, in the most resonant way possible. (RO)There’s a deeper sense of personal connection to anchor Julia Jacklin’s lyrical and melodic smarts. That snare drum on “Pressure to Party” keeps a relentless, nerve-snapping pulse throughout, while “Don’t Know How to Keep Loving You” nails a depth of intimacy while acknowledging relationship ennui. Grunge-rinsed, feminist-flipped, upcycled Fifties guitar an’ all: Crushing is a triumph. (HB)Philippakis’s voice is shrouded in the smoke from society’s wreckage. Lead single “Exits”, six scintillating minutes of Eighties “sledgehammer” pop that lumbers into view like a heavy artillery vehicle covered in sequins, concerns the one percenters building underground cities to escape global warming. “Syrups” has Yannis howling a passionate post-apocalyptic vision of robot invasions and sand-clogged towns over a corroded Gorillaz dub that builds to a motoric charge as global panic sets in. An inspired album of scorched earth music. (MB)A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity. On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album. (RO)Weyes Blood, whose real name is Natalie Mering, accompanies her instrumental idiosyncrasies with strong, luscious melodies and unfussy lyrics. “No one’s ever gonna give you a trophy for all the pain and the things you’ve been through,” she sings on “Mirror Forever”. “No one knows but you.”And then there’s that voice – at once warm and haunting, controlled and untethered. It’s no wonder she’s lent it to the likes of Perfume Genius, Drugdealer and Ariel Pink: it adds a touch of profundity to everything it meets. (AP)The warm splashes of piano that washed over that song also break through the anxious rattle of dance beats on the album’s eponymous opener, the singer so regularly reviewed as “vaporous” promises to “leave the ether, assume form” and “be touchable, be reachable”. His own sharpest critic, he winks at the journalists who’ve called him glacial as he drops from remote, icy falsetto into a richly grained, deeper tone to ask: “Doesn’t it seem much warmer?” (HB)Following the traumatised chaos of 2016’s Skeleton Tree, Ghosteen is a warm cloud of ambient solace – a sonic evocation of the communion he has experienced through his newly porous relationship with his audience. He sounds buoyed, not weakened, by exposing his wounds. (HB)4550 6) Tyler, the Creator – IGORThe production here is superb. Tyler has never been one for traditional song structure, but on IGOR, which is undoubtedly a break-up album, he’s like the Minotaur – luring you through a maze that twists and turns around seemingly impossible corners, drawing you into the thrilling unknown. Its lack of resolution at the close – surely the most torturous element of a great love lost – makes it all the more powerful. (RO)The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece. (MB)Few albums in 2019 have been as eclectic, or with as singular a vision, as Simz’s GREY Area. She flips between two tones: formidable and reflective. On tracks such as “Offence” and “Boss” she drips with venom delivering lines in a low, deadly buzz over killer bass hooks and punk distortion. On “Selfish” and “Flowers” she’s softer – allowing herself to be vulnerable because she knows she doesn’t have to ditch all sentiment to compete with her male peers. She’s better because she embraces every facet of herself, and offers it to the listener in as clear a statement as possible. (RO)Lana Del Rey has always been obsessed with the past. Hers is a sound rooted in nostalgia, a paean to everything she was born too late to live through: old Hollywood, Sinatra, beat poetry, Sylvia Plath and Fifties Americana. At her best, she mines something fresh from it all. At her worst, she wallows in it. Her new album Norman F**king Rockwell!, named after a 20th-century American artist, does both. (AP)When Aldous Harding performed in London this month, an enamoured fan cried out that they loved her. “I appreciate that,” she replied softly. “But, I’m busy.” The response is Harding to a T – wry, weird, introspective, focused. Her spectacular, singular third album, Designer, is all of those things. Taking the left-field folk that made her name and splashing post-psych pop and jittery orchestral flourishes onto the canvas, the New Zealander harbours secrets while beckoning you in. “As humans we are imperfect,” he can be heard saying in a teaser “super trailer” for his 2020 plans.“My past, my mistakes, all the things that I\u0027ve been through… I believe that I\u0027m right where I\u0027m supposed to be and God has me right where he wants me.”The promo video finds Bieber, wearing his trademark baggy hoodie and woolly hat, sitting outside a petrol station and wandering around a trailer park near Los Angeles as he contemplates his next move.Ariana Grande releases new live album ‘k bye for now’The 50 best albums of 2019Justin Bieber shares contrite Instagram message about personal growthEarlier this year, Bieber wrote about his struggles with drug use and depression in an emotional essay, in which he described himself as “the most hated person in the world”.“I feel like this is different from the previous albums just because of where I\u0027m at with my life,” he goes on in the video. “I\u0027m excited to perform it and to tour it.“We all have different stories, I\u0027m just excited to share mine.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.“LOOK WHAT IM WRAPPING MY DAD’S XMAS GIFTS IN,” she wrote in an Instagram post that has been circulating online.One person who especially enjoyed this joke was s of the Galaxy director James\u0026nbspGunn, one of several figures associated with the MCU who criticised Scorsese’s views.“This is Martin\u0026nbspScorsese’s\u0026nbspdaughter’s wrapping paper for her dad,” he wrote, adding: “Makes me feel less strange about the Shutter Island wallpaper my nephew wrapped my gifts in.”\u0026nbspScorsese’s latest film, The Irishman, is available to stream on Netflix now.

It does not reveal which animals were involved or other details.The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) and Public Health England (PHE), both based in Wiltshire, received sums for five projects: three of $3,500, one of $4,140 and one of $1,680 for projects from 2017 to 2024, looking into infectious diseases using animals.University College London dropped plans to carry out procedures involving sheep and rabbits, electrically stimulating their nerves to find treatments for human conditions such as epilepsy and arthritis, which originally involved an NIH grant application of $776,000.Researchers from the University of Bath worked on medicinal chemistry with counterparts in the US who received funding to make rhesus monkeys addicted to heroin, cocaine and alcohol.Brexit ‘could trigger surge in animal testing’ as EU rules invalidatedSome of the studies, aimed at finding ways to prevent people who have come off opioids and cocaine from relapsing, involved testing the efficacy of preventive drugs on the animals.The grants did not go to Bath scientists but to those at the University of Texas Health Science Centre at San Antonio, who fitted the animals with catheters, allowing them to self-administer drugs.The White Coat Waste project says it tried to launch an advertising campaign about the monkey testing, but the adverts were banned by authorities.The watchdog group gathers its information from government databases, freedom of information requests, members of congress, whistleblowers, official websites and scientific publications.Anthony Bellotti, founder and president, said: “It’s high time to stop shipping hardworking Americans’ money to the UK for nonsense like hooking fish on nicotine and addicting primates to heroin.“Most Americans oppose animal testing, and with a nearly-trillion-dollar deficit and so many US scientists who can’t find jobs in their fields, there’s no excuse for sending American tax dollars overseas to abuse animals and enrich foreign iniduals and institutions.”A spokeswoman for Queen Mary University of London said: “Medical research at world-class universities like Queen Mary saves and enhances the lives of millions of people worldwide, with breakthroughs often coming as a result of research involving animals.US government vows to continue controversial experiments on dogs“Indeed, UK law requires that all medicines should be tested in at least two different species of live animals before their use in humans.“However, it is important that animals are used for research only when it is absolutely necessary and no alternative is available. In this case, the genetic characteristics that zebrafish share with mammals provide insights that could help scientists to develop treatments for addiction in humans.”Work is overseen by an animal welfare and ethical review body, she said.Oxford University said most of its biomedical research used animal alternatives, adding: “Sadly, we are not yet at the point where these techniques or computer modelling could entirely replace the need for animal research.“The university has consistently been at the forefront of innovative and life-saving science. Our research provides vital insight into cancer, strokes, heart disease, diabetes, HIV, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and many more diseases that cause suffering and death.”A spokesman said researchers commit to replacing animals, reducing numbers used and refining experiments to ensure animals suffer as little as possible, he said.\u0026nbspA Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “DSTL is responsible for developing new vaccines, therapies and treatments that can save military lives and benefit civilians and which could not, currently, be achieved without the use of animals in research.“DSTL is committed to reducing the number of animal experiments and only applies for licences if the research aims cannot be achieved without animal experiments.”A PHE spokesman said: “Most of our research is carried out without involving animals however, some remains essential to understand how infections are transmitted and to prevent the spread of disease, as well as studying how environmental factors affect human health.” PHE has signed up to the Concordat on Openness in Animal Research, he said.The three UK universities receiving funding have also signed the concordat.A University of Bath spokesman said it did not conduct animal experiments with non-human primates, adding: “We conduct biomedical research aimed at understanding disease and developing new drugs, including new treatments for opioid abuse. We work with small rodents and some fish species.”Heptares Therapeutics has also been approached for comment.A statement by NIH said all animals used in research it funds are protected by laws, regulations, and policies “to ensure the smallest possible number of subjects and the greatest commitment to their welfare”. Institutions receiving funds must follow the Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the statement said.It added that foreign grant recipients must provide NIH with an assurance and certification of compliance with laws, regulations and policies of the jurisdiction in which the research is conducted, and a pledge to follow the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals. NIH “encourages foreign recipients to use the standards in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals”. In the UK the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body evaluates proposed research.“Alternatives” – the three Rs (reduce, refine, replace) – are embodied in an NIH ethical framework document which states that mathematical models, computer simulation, and in-vitro systems should be considered wherever possible.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In 2007-08 alone, the MoD settled a tranche of 57 cases a further 20 were concluded between 2003 and 2010. Overall, 159 claims were made, with some rejected and others withdrawn, the FoI response said.It comes just weeks after the government admitted it had treated former royal navy radio operator Joe Ousalice “in a way that would not be acceptable today” when he was forced out of the senior service in 1993.Falklands War veteran Mr Ousalice, who is bisexual, was also stripped of a long service and good conduct medal when he was discharged. The award will now be returned to him, following court action that concluded earlier this month.Other former service members can apply for medals lost in similar circumstances to be reinstated.The MoD spokesman added: “Any iniduals who forfeited a medal in connection with an offence, for which they are able to obtain a disregard under the terms of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012, will need to apply for the restoration of the medal under the terms of the policy being operated by the Cabinet Office.“Cases will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ministers should be doing all they can to put this right.”In a written answer to a parliamentary question in January, defence minister Tobias Ellwood said that “since the lifting of the ban on LGBT personnel serving in the military in the year 2000, the MoD has welcomed and supported all personnel, irrespective of sexual orientation, actively celebrating and supporting the ersity of all our personnel.”He added: “Support is available including through LGBT champions, senior LGBT role models, active LGBT networks and over 150 personnel trained by Stonewall as LGBT allies.”All three branches of the forces are ranked by Stonewall, a leading campaign group, as among its top 100 employers.Ministry of Defence\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Keir Starmer, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and David Lammy\u0026nbspmay also join the race.\u0026nbspEd Miliband’s inquiry into Labour’s defeat is a lost causeThe left of the party is thought to be coalescing around Rebecca Long Bailey, the shadow business secretary, who has kept quiet since Labour’s disastrous election showing.Mr Jarvis, the MP for Barnsley Central, said traditional Labour voters in places such as South Yorkshire felt the party no longer represented them.“Too many people said they weren’t prepared to vote Labour this time. We have got to listen to those people,” he\u0026nbsptold BBC Radio 4’s The World at One.“Yes, it is about the leader.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailBritain may have avoided recession – but we shouldn’t be celebratingAdded to all\u0026nbspthis was the volatile situation between the US and China as their trade war escalated over the year, which has compounded the global growth slowdown, with knock-on effects on the UK.Official figures showed Britain’s growth flatlined in October and sector surveys since then have painted an equally gloomy picture.The Bank of England cut its outlook for fourth-quarter growth to a paltry 0.1 per cent as the prospects for the economy began to look decidedly downbeat and left the door firmly open to an interest rate cut in its last decision of 2019.While rates were held at 0.75 per cent all year, two of the Bank’s policymakers have voted since November for a cut to 0.5 per cent.The solid Conservative Party win is seen as potentially offering a boost in the form of government spending, while also lifting the clouds of political uncertainty.But by far the biggest factor affecting growth is Brexit and trade deal prospects, which remain far from certain as Mr Johnson has signalled he will seek to pass legislation that could cause a cliff-edge Brexit at the end of 2020.George Brown at Investec said: “A no-deal Brexit could still manifest itself as soon as the end of next year, whereas a re-escalation in the US-China trade dispute cannot be ruled out.”Despite this caution, Investec still believes rates will be lifted to 1 per cent in mid-2021.Howard Archer, chief UK economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the outlook for the economy in 2020 will once again see Brexit as the deciding factor and the Bank may need to take action if growth remains in the doldrums.And with inflation remaining well below the Bank’s 2 per cent target – at 1.5 per cent in November – there is room to do so if necessary.Mr Archer said: “If the UK economy fails to show clear signs of picking up in the early months of 2020, pressure will clearly mount on the Bank of England to trim interest rates to provide support.“Pressure for lower interest rates could also mount if the economy continues to be hampered by concerns over the UK’s longer-term relationship with the EU and what will happen at the end of 2020 when the transition arrangement will be due to end.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Only Canada comes close to the UK, with a threefold increase in average property prices.\u0026nbspHouse prices in the UK have also risen substantially faster than incomes. Average house prices are now almost twice as high relative to a measure of average household disposable income as they were 40 years ago.Andrew Bailey faces a host of challenges as next Bank of England chiefChronic undersupply of housing in the UK has frequently been blamed for pushing up prices but David Miles and Victoria Monro at the Bank of England found this has not been a significant driver.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The researchers compared house prices, which have risen sharply, with rents, which have remained relatively stable compared to incomes.They concluded that if the main cause of rising prices was lack of properties then rents would also have increased sharply – but this has not happened.According to the bank, UK homeowners currently have a record £1.6 trillion of outstanding home loans.The latest research suggests the\u0026nbspproperty market\u0026nbspwould be vulnerable to sustained interest rate increases – despite the stress tests that loan applicants take to estimate whether they could afford rising monthly mortgage payments in the event that interest rates go up.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But some inidual stories have also had the power to elicit what feels like a global response.Here are some of the wildest, most tragic, and most endearing stories of the last decade – the times when it felt impossible not to follow the story.No sooner had the decade begun than\u0026nbspEyjafjallajökull erupted – prompting travel chaos, an apocalyptic atmosphere and a pronunciation challenge for non-Icelandic newsreaders everywhere.Having laid dormant since 1823, the eruption, in the south of Iceland, saw ash shoot 30,000 feet into the air, creating a dark cloud that quite literally hung over Europe and caused the widest disruption to air travel since WWII.Over a period of six days, hundreds of locals were evacuated and tens of thousands of flights were cancelled.Created with Sketch.Best pictures of the decade Show all 72Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters flee from tear gas fired by riot police during clashes after protesters removed a concrete barrier at Qasr al-Aini Street near Tahrir Square in Cairo, Egypt on 24 JanuaryAmid tight security, members of the public arrive to pay their respects at the funeral of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Bernard \u0027Tignous\u0027 Verlhac at Pere Lachaise Cemetery on January 15  in Paris, France.

By the time the vessel arrived in Immingham, it was clear that this was the worst crisis in European aviation since the dark days following 911.The following days were characterised by stories of desperate travellers, growing frustration at what was increasingly seen as a gross overreaction, and various airlines failing to respect their obligations under European air passengers’ rights rules.”In the first but by no means the last enthralling cave disaster of the decade, 33 men became trapped for a staggering 69 days after a collapse at the copper and gold mine in which they worked.A true testament to the strength of the human spirit, the miners sent videos to the surface via a mini-camera, and were saidTheir eventual rescue, after two months, involved Nasa, and was watched by over a billion people worldwide, according to Chile’s state broadcaster - but it did take 23 hours.Mexican film-maker Patricia Riggen directed the 2016 film, The 33, and tells The Independent why the story spoke to her.“The idea of brotherhood was what drove me to tell this story. That is why I find these 33 men admirable.“And the world united in that moment to make this true miracle of humanity and technology and chance happen. It was the fact that they kept it together under the worst circumstances ever imagined, and helped each other, that they were able to stay alive.“And above ground people did the same, uniting forces, bringing everyone together: government, technology, resources, the love of the families, and the faith that they were still alive.“I love telling stories about the human spirit. About the best we have in ourselves. About humanity, which for me is the ability to rise to the circumstances and reach beyond ourselves for a greater good— to help a loved one, or a complete stranger. This is what makes life truly worth living. It’s what makes us humans. The Chilean miner’s story is one that we can all be proud of as humans.”Its modern image created largely in the shadow of the devastating twin atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan found itself victim to another nuclear crisis - this one triggered by the 9.0-magnitude Tohoku earthquake.That tremor and subsequent tsunami killed over 15,000 people and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant - displacing hundreds of thousands of people. This was a modern-day Chernobyl, in the internet era. The Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) which operated the plant, spent months denying a meltdown had occurred, and public mistrust remains high. In September of this year, the Japanese government announced it might have to soon release one million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea.Fukushima, four years on: inside the town the world forgotIn November 2011, eight months after the accident, journalists were, for the first time, allowed to visit the site.Writing for The New York Times, Martin Fackler wrote that:“About three dozen journalists sat on two buses. We wore protective suits, double gloves, double layers of clear plastic booties over shoes, hair covers, respirator masks, and carried radiation detectors. As we drove to the Fukushima plant, we passed through a police checkpoint, and saw three towns – Naraha, Tomioka, Okuma – empty of all inhabitants. Among the abandoned homes was a flower shop with plants, withered and dead, still on display.At the base of the reactor buildings, there were crumpled trucks, contorted metal girders and frames of buildings, a huge storage tank dented and bent, and pipes twisted by the forces of nature. The damage reached up to the second storey, attesting to the tsunami\u0027s 14-metre size. A four metre-high sea wall has been built with rocks in black nets. Tepco said it was a makeshift defence against another tsunami. The reading here was 300ms.The nuclear crisis minister, Goshi Hosono, came to address the men here. “Every time I come back, I feel conditions have improved,” he said. “This is due to your hard work.” He said he is aiming for a cold shutdown by the end of the year. All good news, then? Not quite. There are still 30 years of work after that, he said, referring to the dismantling of the reactors.”In what would become a defining moment of Barack Obama’s presidency, and after 10 years in hiding, Al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was located to a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Killed and buried at sea, the circumstances of his death were a foreshadow of the 2019 killing of Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi - likely also to become one of Donald Trump’s key legacies.Sohaib Athar, a software expert, had recently moved to Abbottabad, in the eastern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, and inadvertently live-tweeted witnessing the May 2011 raid on bin Laden’s compound, conducted by Seal Team Six.He tells The Independent he has no regrets about tweeting that night.Crowds gather in US cities after Bin Laden killed“I was mostly amused - not by the raid of course, that was serious stuff - but by the irony of moving from Lahore to Abbottabad for some peace and quiet and landing in the middle of an international incident.“I don’t regret tweeting that night - it gave me a fresh perspective on how the multiple sides of a story are perceived by people from different parts of the world, and how easy it is for all sides involved to force a certain narrative on the world by a deliberate choice of words and cherry-picking.“I live in Islamabad now, but still have a tiny home in Abbottabad, and my coffee shop is still operational, so I visit every few months.“The media coverage that the incident received, and is still receiving, enforced an image of Pakistan that is reinforced at every \u0027anniversary\u0027. Pakistan is a mostly normal country if events are not sensationalised disproportionately. Abbottabad moved on a couple of weeks after the incident, the rest of the world still calls it news.”On 12 January, 2010, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti, on the Caribbean island of Hiiola.Already suffering from decades of political and economic turmoil - 70 per cent of the population was living under the poverty line at the time - the devastating tremor killed a quarter of a million people, and left a further 1.5 million living in makeshift camps.Naromie Marline Joseph Fatal, a psychological support worker with MSF in Haiti, tells The Independent about that day, and the months and years that followed.“I experienced the earthquake the same way that everyone else did, I was helpless. I thought that an atomic bomb had gone off, the noise was so loud.Huge toll feared in Haiti earthquake“I saw buildings and trees collapsing, one after another… and the hospital, a five-storey building, was trembling. I couldn’t go anywhere - I lay down on the floor and clenched my fists. God, help me!, I prayed.“In the days that followed, tractors picked up bodies as if they were rubbish. Four years later I spoke to a psychologist myself, to chase those images away.“After the earthquake… psychological support was needed on a massive scale. The level of need was huge – there were bereaved parents, depressed people, the shock of the deaths.“I began working full time with MSF, as they were the only organisation who were taking care of people with psychiatric needs. It needs to be said that what happened pushed people who were already fragile over the edge.“It was an event that touched all of humanity, 300,000 dead is unthinkable. International aid and media attention were particularly strong over the five years following the earthquake.“We’ve heard a lot of talk about reconstruction. Me, I haven’t seen it yet. We’re still waiting.For those who had seen Lost, the story seemed eerily familiar - so I’m told. Had the plane actually disappeared?But despite the best efforts of Malaysian authorities to insist the plane would be found, and all 227 passengers and 12 crew were still alive, it was soon clear this was either a tragic accident or mass murder.Again, Simon Calder reflects on this truly mysterious event.“Before 8 March 2014, aviation had a long history of planes disappearing mysteriously. But none was on the scale of MH370.The Malaysia Airlines jet had taken off from Kuala Lumpur on a routine flight to Beijing. The first the world knew that anything was wrong what when air-traffic controllers in Vietnam were unable to make contact with the Boeing 777. After some fictitious reports that it had landed in southern China with technical problems, MH370 was declared missing and presumed to have crashed in the South China Sea.The manifest showed there was 239 people on board (though some say there may have been at least one more, hiding in an under-floor bay before perpetrating an act of mass murder).For a week, rescuers conducted a fruitless search in the waters between Malaysia and Vietnam. Then, at a dramatic press conference in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian prime minister, Najib Razak, announced that the aircraft had remained aloft for hours after it disappeared. An analysis of automated signals by Inmarsat revealed the 777 must have flown along one of two arcs: northwest across southern China towards the Caspian Sea, or south across the Indian Ocean to an area west of Australia.The authorities concluded that the former was impossible without the plane being spotted, and Australia took control of the search operation. From an air force base north of Perth, reconnaissance flights begin of the presumed crash area. Plans were made for an unprecedented, and ultimately unsuccessful, sweep of the ocean floor. Fragments of the aircraft started washing up on Indian Ocean beaches – though analysis of the species of barnacles that had grown up on the aircraft’s “flaperon” failed to help locate the wreckage.One person very close to the saga believes the plane will be found in the southern Indian Ocean once undersea drone technology makes it feasible to deploy 100 or more unmanned devices to plumb the depths for signs of former life.Created with Sketch.The Independent\u0027s Women of the Decade, 2010-2019 Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In September 2018, psychology professor Dr Christine Blasey Ford publicly accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, when she was 15 years old.

The inquiry was launched following reports that Trump had attempted to pressure the president of Ukraine into investigating the son of former US vice president Joe Biden.350 Serena Williams, tennis player and fashion designerThroughout her 24-year tennis career, Serena Williams’ sporting achievements have completely redefined the sport, resulting in her winning 23 Grand Slam singles tournaments and being named the world number one on eight separate occasions.450 Rose McGowan, actor and activistRose McGowan gained prominence in the 1990s and early Noughties for her performances in films including The Doom Generation and Scream and her role in supernatural series Charmed.Brave and becoming one of the leading figures of the #MeToo movement.Time magazine named its Person of the Year the ‘Silence Breakers’, those whose voices ‘launched a movement’ against sexual harassment and assault. McGowan was one of the iniduals featured, alongside Ashley Judd, Alyssa Milano, Selma Blair and many others.550 Teresa Shook, co-founder of the Women’s MarchAfter the election of Donald Trump as President in 2016, women across the United States organised small, grass roots marches, in a bid to speak out against much of the anti-female rhetoric used during Trump’s election campaign. 650 Gina Miller, business owner and campaignerIn June 2016, Business owner Gina Miller lead a successful legal challenge against the UK government. Miller argued that MPs should be able to vote on whether or not to invoke Article 50, that would allow the UK to begin the process to leave the EU.750 Alyssa Milano, actor and activistAt 9.21pm on 15 October 2017, Charmed star Alyssa Milano shared a tweet that would relaunch one of the most impactful social movements of recent years. The actor asked her followers to respond to her tweet writing ‘me too’ if they had ever experienced sexual harassment or assault.850 Michelle Obama, lawyer, writer and former US first ladyAs first lady of the US from 2009 to 2017, Michelle Obama inspired countless people with her motivational work promoting women’s issues, raising awareness of poverty and encouraging members of the public to lead healthy lives. Becoming became the best-selling book in the US in 2018.In 2017, freelance writer Gina Martin was at a music festival when a man took a photograph up her skirt with his phone without her consent. Martin immediately took action, informing the police what had occurred. Her case was closed shortly thereafter.1050 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, US politician and congresswomanIn June 2018, bartender Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez burst onto the political scene when she defeated Democratic politician Joseph Crowley to serve as Representative of New York’s 14th congressional district, in what was regarded as one of the largest upsets to occur during the midterm elections. 1150 Meghan Markle, Duchess of SussexPrior to her relationship with Prince Harry, Meghan Markle was best-known for starring in US legal drama Suits. Meghan used her platform as a celebrity to campaign for important causes, most notably in 2015 when she delivered an empowering speech about gender equality at the UN Women Conference.Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg has become a force to be reckoned with on the world stage, inspiring an environmental movement that has ned the globe. The journey of the 2019 Time magazine ‘Person of the Year’ had humble beginnings. At 15-years-old Thunberg began standing outside the Swedish parliament holding a sign that read: ‘School strike for the climate.’In 2014 Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie published her critically-acclaimed essay We Should All Be Feminists. The literary work, which was adapted from her 2012 TEDx talk of the same name, discussed feminism and the problems of toxic masculinity. 1450 Laura Bates, founder of the Everyday Sexism ProjectIn 2012, writer Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism Project with the aim of raising awareness of the microaggressions and discriminations women face on a daily basis. ‘When I started the Everyday Sexism Project almost a decade ago, feminism still felt like a dirty word and sexism was considered a thing of the past,’ said Bates.Everyday Sexism, published in 2014, and Misogynation, published in 2019.

Heavy rains soon led rapidly rising waters soon blocked off their entrance into the Tham Luang Nang Non cave, and again the world was transfixed, first in fear - no contact was made for the first week, until the boys sent a note - and then in optimism, when an international band of cave ers, entrepreneurs and NAVY seals worked on various plans of action.One Thai NAVY Seal died during the efforts, and while two British ers were instrumental in ultimately retrieving the boys, an international team worked together to secure their route out.Ben Reymenants, a Belgian cave er based in Thailand, was involved in the initial search and rescue operation.\u0026nbsp“First minute I was like, wow, this is stunning, it’s a really beautiful cave, in a not so happy situation – and then I saw the water, which resembled a Colorado river, brown mud and the high force coming out of the cave and my initial thought was – there’s no way.

He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking. He recalls seeing many dead bodies lining the sides of the tracks that led to Uganda’s northern border. The family were fearful of abduction by rebel groups or becoming caught in crossfire between the government and militia groups. David enjoyed school immensely in South Sudan but said his school had closed due to conflict. He attends Alaba School at Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement. David dreams of a better life for his family.Sarah, 14, arrived to Kigeme refugee camp from DRC in 2012. Her parents, now unemployed in Rwanda, worked as rag traders. They made the decision to flee the fighting for the safety and relative calm of Rwanda. They were made to feel very welcome by the host community. Sarah is enrolled in class, three years behind where she should be, due to conflict, and she really enjoys her schooling. GS Gasaka school, run by Education Above All Foundation and UNHCR, is providing her the environment to allow her to dream one day of becoming an accountant so she can help her family live a better life.Nakato 19, was born and raised in Yumbe, Uganda. A graduate from Aruma High School, she has aspirations of becoming a journalist. She is actively involved in a movement called “Raise up and Talk” to help empower the younger generation to share their experiences and stories as a form of therapy, to help process the trauma from a life in conflict. Forestal, nine, is in second grade at Marescot School, Haiti. The school is funded through the partnership between non-profit buildOn Haiti, and Educate A Child (EAC), who have constructed 58 schools, as well as training 959 teachers. Forestal explains how she was given up by her father after the death of her mother. She now lives with her auntie as a “restavek” (child in domestic servitude) where she performs chores around the house for at least two hours a day including laundry, sweeping and mopping floors. She can only recall seeing her father once in her entire life. “It was only for one day, but it was really great, we had so much fun,” she says. Forestal hopes that she can see him again – but he lives and works in Port Au Prince, more than three hours away by car.Furaha, six, attends Buremba Primary School. She is a member of the Batwa “Pygmy” tribe, forced out of their native home in the Bwindi Forest to make way for a national park protected as a Unesco World Heritage Site. She lives in Kitahurira settlement camp, about 2.5km and a three-hour walk from her school. The construction of schools and training of teachers in remote areas of challenging geography ensures those hardest to reach have a right to education. Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”David, 13, arrived in Uganda in July 2016 fleeing the civil war that broke out in South Sudan. He arrived with his mother and father and his eight brothers and sisters after two days of walking.

Building Tomorrow Uganda through its partnership with Education Above All Foundation has enrolled 53,373 out-of-school children back into quality primary education in Uganda.Niyosenga,12, arrived from Kiyiri, DRC, in 2016. Her mother was killed in the fierce fighting which swept through towns and villages. She made the journey with her father and grandmother to the relative safe haven of Uganda to join the 1.2 million refugees. Niyosenga remained out of education in DRC until the age of nine as the long walk to school was too dangerous with roads closed by police or rebel militia.To help pay for Niyosenga’s school fees her father grows maize while her grandmother, 72, weaves baskets.Jasme, 10, is enrolled at a buildOn school in Perigny. Her two brothers and three sisters all attend the same school. Unlike the reported 300,000 restavek children that live away from their biological parents, Jasme lives with her family.Esperence, 10, goes to Perigny school. Seated on a bench at the end of a long dark corridor, overcome with emotion, he explains how he was given up by his biological parents at the age of eight. He now lives with his auntie and is a restavek child. The term restavek comes from the French rester avec, to stay with. Discussing the work around the house he has to complete as part of his daily chores, he explains: “I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs.”Yean, six, lives in Phnom Penh. Yean’s mother, a widow, feels helpless as she simply cannot earn enough to support her family. Today, Yean lives with her 80-year-old grandmother Khzm Men in Sensok 5, a settlement in the village of Kohmouta on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The settlement was relocated from one of the capital’s inner city slums areas. Yean attends public school on the periphery of the settlement but due to the informal school fees system in Cambodia, she is forced to consider dropping out due to lack of funds. Yean is desperate to continue her education to fulfil her dreams of becoming a nurse, but without assistance her dreams seem out of reach.Charles, 16, lived with his mother and father in DRC. The Marekera family were forced to leave because their son was persecuted for being an albino. His father was repeatedly beaten after refusing to sell Charles to witchdoctors, who believe teeth, fingers and eyes brought good luck to those who bought their body parts. The transition for Charles arriving in Uganda from DRC has left him with large gaps in his education. Leaving as a senior in secondary school, he now finds himself back in primary school – and facing a similar stigma as an albino in Uganda. His long walks to school are interrupted by strangers attempting to lure him away to profit from the sale of his body parts. Charles explained: “I will never feel safe, however my safety now is less important to me than getting an education. I am determined to get my diploma and have a job where I can help protect the rights of other albinos.”Athar, 21, a beneficiary of Al Fakhoora, a programme of the Education Above All Foundation, was the youngest member to join the writers’ association, aged 14. She stressed the importance of explaining what is happening to the Palestinian people. Five years ago the conflict changed her life forever. She said: “The house was full of our relatives, suddenly everything went dark. I tried to get out of the house, I felt a pain in my leg and there was so much blood. I lost consciousness and woke in the ambulance. Hospitals ran out of anaesthetic so doctors stitched injuries I sustained without it, it was incredibly painful. I heard the news that my father was killed. Losing him was incredibly difficult for me as we were so close.” As a child, Athar had dreamt of becoming a writer or a poet. She said: “My father was my inspiration, encouraging me to write, since his death I have struggled to write anything. For me education is like food or fuel, an energy that gives me power to keep going.”Moza was born and raised east of the Tigris river that ides the city of Mosul. Her parents and five siblings have lived in a two-room concrete dwelling for 10 years. Farhan, Moza’s father, works as a labourer carrying blocks on construction sites across the city. He is in need of a hernia operation, which will cost £200, and finds work extremely difficult. He can’t afford six months off work to recover. The family income is only £62 per month, which barely covers bills. They are forced to take credit from shops to be able to eat. Moza is due to enrol back into schooling. However, at present, she cares for her mother who suffers respiratory problems due to a lodged bullet in her lung after being caught in crossfire during the conflict. She doesn’t know what to expect as she has never set foot in a classroom. Two years beyond the normal enrolment age of six, she still has great dreams of working with NGOs to help residents displaced from the city.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Ali, nine, a Syrian refugee family from Deir ez-Zur district in eastern Syria arrived in Lebanon in 2011. They fled their home with several neighbours by bus toward a safer haven in Lebanon at the outbreak of civil war, which tore through their country. Heavy shelling bombarded their bus and the remainder of their journey had to be made on foot. Nine-year old Ali Ahmed’s father, an agricultural labourer explained that life in Lebanon was hard as they struggle to pay basic bills such as food and rent. As with most Syrian refugees, they are in debt to their landlords and to local shops owners. The collective family income is barely enough to cover any of their bills. Ali, one of the family’s 10 children, attends school 10km from home and dreams, one day, to be able to return home with his family to Syria.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Owen, 16, has been enrolled in Buremba Primary School since 2007 and is one of eight siblings. Now in older years at school, he must pay more money. His parents are peasant farmers and work the land digging and picking tea, this means they must work most days to be able to keep up the payments. Buremba School is one of 60 new schools constructed under the Building Tomorrow and Educate A Child programme in Uganda.Afat, 12, left his home in Deir ez-Zor, Syria six years ago, forced out by the civil war which displaced millions of people, in his case to the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon. He is one of the thousands of Syrian refugee children sat in doorways of Lebanon’s many tents, shelters and makeshift homes dreaming of an education. Instead, he works 11 hours a day collecting scrap metal which he sells for around £2.50. He knows he has a right to education, but he is concerned to help provide for his family. He dreams of one day being able to return home to Syria with his family, to a better life.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added: “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Ikiriza, 5, Kamwenge District, Uganda. Ikiriza who is five years old lives in a small house with his nine brothers and sisters. His parents can’t afford school tuition fees for all the children, leaving Ikiriza with little choice but to fund his own education by working weekends carrying plastic jerry cans of water from the lake for various households of the neighbourhood in Kamwenge district. For this, he earns the equivalent of 5 US cents a day, which helps contribute towards his school fees at Bisozi Primary. He dreams of one day becoming a doctor so that he can help his father who suffers from ill health.Rami, six, lives at Beach Camp, on the sea front amongst the heart of the fishing community al-Shati in the northern Gaza Strip. Rami walks amongst the rubble of shelled buildings, a reminder of past and present conflicts. Restriction to employment and travel have meant many Palestinians are confined in Gaza. Some bright lights still shine as Rami attends grade P1 in school and dreams of becoming a footballer one day.Abdul 10, with his gaze to the floor, wrapped in blankets, huddles by the family stove. His father, Muhammad, emerges from the black of the adjoining room clutching an armful of medical documents written in French, a language he cannot read. His son is two years overdue a heart operation that would save his life. Srey, three, lives in a small dark room with her parents, siblings and relatives. A total of eight people live in a cramped, damp space in a makeshift barn of corrugated metal on the edge of the railroad tracks in the urban slums. The CYMCA Facility drop-in centre, funded in partnership between EAA and Aide et Action, provides emergency education to around 80 children in the area.Joender, six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela arrived in Ipiales, Colombia, after a 33-day journey mainly on foot. He is one of 3.5 million Venezuelan refugees that have left their homes following a catastrophic economic meltdown of his country leaving its citizens starving with no access to food, employment, medical services or education. He holds a packet of crackers, a kind donation from one of the many generous Colombians offering support to the Venezuelan people.Kennedy, 13, displaced to Uganda. He is another statistic of the 2.3 million South Sudanese refugees that fled the outbreak of civil war. Uganda alone shouldering 800,000 refugees. Kennedy was denied a normal childhood and instead became a witness to violence, torture and death in war. Not surprisingly, Kennedy’s family were unwilling to send him to school with threat of armed attack, abduction or recruitment by militias. On arrival in Uganda, Kennedy was still held back from attending school and fulfilling his dream of becoming a doctor. His parents were simply unable to afford the cost of a pair of shoes required for enrolment.“The canvas Billingham bags which carry the tools of my trade. They have sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world listening with me to every word of every story. I feel torn staring at them, joy at returning to my loved ones and the heartache of those I had to leave behind. Now they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up and lined up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away.….”As each year draws to a close, emotions you\u0026nbsphave tried to control finally take grip. I feel torn – from the joy at returning to my\u0026nbsploved ones and the heartache for those I\u0026nbsphad to leave behind. I am staring at my canvas camera bags, which sat beside me in the dust of countries around the world.\u0026nbspNow they sit on the polished floor of my room, zipped up. I need them closer, to feel their weight on my shoulders again, I need to be away…Here I have compiled a collection of photographs and memories, comprising the stories of some of the most marginalised children in the world.Winter: Abdul, a Syrian refugee aged 10, is seated in a makeshift shelter, perched high among\u0026nbspthe rugged snowy mountain caps of Arsal, Lebanon. He holds his father’s hand as they both huddle\u0026nbspby the stove for warmth. He has the haunting stare of a boy who knows he is\u0026nbspgoing to die, an expression that cuts through the paraffin haze of the dark room as temperatures fall below zero. Mohammed, his father, gaunt from grief, explains\u0026nbsphis son is two years overdue for an operation that could save his life.\u0026nbspWith no means to finance it, he raises\u0026nbsphis hands to the sky in hope that his prayers would be answered.\u0026nbspI remember waiting to see my doctor as a child. I knew my turn would come Abdul knew his would not.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpring:\u0026nbspVenezuelan refugees who once ate together as families around their own tables\u0026nbspnow eat from rubbish bins on their hands and knees to survive the crisis in their country. All the while, their president publicly feasts\u0026nbspin lavish establishments. Roughly 3.5 million Venezuelans, among them doctors, lawyers and teachers, have left their country, out of starvation and fear.Joender, aged six, from Maracaibo in Venezuela, arrived in\u0026nbspIpiales, Colombia, exhausted and hungry. He was offloaded with his family from a galvanised lorry like cattle, after a 33-day journey, mostly on foot, where they were forced to beg for food to survive. His cupped hands are\u0026nbsprewarded with a packet of biscuits donated by a local in the town. He clutches\u0026nbspthe packet like a prize. Having never begged for food myself as a child, I could not begin to understand the internal dialogue in doing so. I knew I could simply open a fridge door\u0026nbspJoender\u0026nbspcan’t.Summer:\u0026nbspEsperence, aged 10, is a Haitian “restavek” or child slave. He was\u0026nbspgiven away by his biological parents to a more affluent household and\u0026nbspforced into a life of domestic servitude. The feeling of being abandoned proves\u0026nbspto be too much for him. Standing in the kitchen and washing dishes, he simply shrugs his small shoulders, and one by one the tears roll\u0026nbspdown his face. Hours each day are spent cleaning, sweeping and washing.\u0026nbsp“I can never go out and play with my friends as my house family always call me back inside to do more jobs,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbspNearly 260 million children aren’t in school – do we care? Forced into a life of domestic servitude, Haiti’s child slavesThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolThe importance of a solid work ethic was engrained into me at a young age. However, I remember the luxury of choice: I knew I could say no. Esperence knows he cannot.\u0026nbspAutumn: Mamoke, aged 10, has never set foot in a classroom. Abandoned by her parents along with her siblings, she now lives with her grandmother at the mercy of abject poverty. In a dark room in remote north western Tanzania, she explains\u0026nbsphow not going to school saddens\u0026nbspher. But she nonetheless still dreams that somehow she could become a teacher to help others like her with no access to education. I didn\u0027t have a choice.\u0026nbspI had to go to school. Mamoke didn’t have a choice, but that was because the right of education was unavailable to her. I realise I have taken so much\u0026nbspfor granted in my life. Children around the world live with no access to healthcare, displaced from their home, going to sleep hungry, growing up in conflict and with no\u0026nbspeducation.I did not choose my career any more than I chose my life. It chose me, and it is the greatest privilege, a blessing and a burden in the same breath. I\u0026nbspwill continue to hold the world to account, hoping\u0026nbspit will eventually force the changes that will create better choices for those who deserve them.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can WhatsApp us on   But he said that the number of downlights hadnt been a drawback for the buyer.It is understood the property was built by an overzealous builder who was passionate about his TV and music.It comes after the seller, Devang Gandhi, told The Sun Online he hadnt expected such an interest in the property after it was listed.He said: The sockets are very handy because you dont have to pull the cables.Wherever you want to stick in the plug, you can stick it in for the TV, DVDs, stereos.The strange abundance of outlets came to light when Twitter user Toby Davies shared the Rightmove link to the property sold by estate agents Andrew Pearce - sarcastically adding: Thinking about buying this house, but Im not sure it has enough plug sockets.On Rightmove, the property is described as a: Family haven situated in a family-friendly location.The accommodation briefly comprises of a bright and spacious entrance hallway with doors leading to all rooms.The dining room enjoys a bay window adding a natural flow of light into the property.The kitchen, dubbed stunning, includes a range of eye and base level units including integrated appliances, a breakfast bar and lots of natural light.With no mention of the ridiculous amount of plug sockets and downlighters, Twitter users took it into their own hands to figure out why the house was filled with outlets.One user wrote: Were they running the CIA from the front room Another witty user quipped: Was this an electricians training centre at one point Others wondered about the price of the owners electricity bill. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitterpx,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitterpx,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitterpx,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" Credit: Twitter  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Decades of seeing the innocent robbed of their lives while the guilty were free to grow old.Years of knowing that those who planned the slaughter were lucky recipients of one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort” — meaning that under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement, known ­terrorists would never be prosecuted.And so got away with murder. Until this week.Mrs Justice Yip ruled in the High Court that the IRA’s John Downey was an “active participant” and “knowingly involved” in the Hyde Park slaughter.“We’ve got justice,” says Sarahjane Young, who was four years old when she watched from the window of her nursery as her -year-old father, Corporal Jeffrey Young, was blown up. “We can call John Downey what he really is at last — a terrorist ­murderer.”The images of that terrible carnage are seared into the memory of anyone old enough to remember.The broken bodies of seven dead horses strewn across the park. The crumpled row of cars destroyed by a lb nail bomb that was built to tear apart flesh and blood and ­families, designed to break hearts and lives and inflict unimaginable human misery.And the heartbreakingly smiling faces of the dead seen earlier as they posed proudly in their Household Caly unorms.Lieutenant Anthony Daly, . ­Corporal Roy Bright, . And two teenagers who were already men.Trooper Simon Tipper, , just back from his honeymoon. And ­Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, also , whose tiny daughter Sarahjane watched her daddy ride by, and then watched him die.John Downey’s fingerprints were found on car park tickets for the vehicle containing the nail bomb. So why has it taken so long to bring the guilty man to justice Because the families of the victims were forced to take out a civil action after the courts failed them.Criminal proceedings against Downey collapsed at the Old Bailey in  because he was one of  IRA members who secretly received one of Tony Blair’s “letters of comfort”.Blair bought peace with the IRA by assuring the men of violence they were no longer wanted for crimes committed during the Troubles.It is a bitter truth that you make peace with your enemies and not your friends. But for far too long the peace brokered by Blair has seemed wickedly, unforgivably one-sided.Hundreds of IRA men were free to live their lives while it took until THIS THURSDAY for Boris Johnson to promise in the Queen’s Speech that former veterans of the British Army who served in the Troubles would finally be free from witch hunts.That Downey has been brought to book at long last is thanks to the fierce determination of the bereaved families and to the generosity of the public, including Sun readers who raised £, to help fund their cause.“I want to thank all of you,” says Mark Tipper, brother of -year-old Trooper Simon Tipper. “You have no idea what this day means to all of us. My brother can sleep easy at last.”The verdict paves the way for the families to pursue Downey— currently on remand in Northern ­Ireland for the murder of two ­soldiers at Enniskillen — for damages of up to half a million pounds. But their success is inevitably tinged with bitter regret.Because it is a shameful stain on our justice system that the families of murdered soldiers were forced to wait  long years for justice.And it is a disgrace that these families were refused legal aid four times while Downey was awarded £, of taxpayers’ money to defend himself against criminal proceedings.And it is mind-boggling — is it not  — that the Labour Party just went into a General Election led by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, two failed politicians who have never made any secret of their ­puerile hero worship of the IRA.McDonnell had a plaque commemorating the “martyrs” of the IRA and INLA on the wall of his constituency office.In , Corbyn caused outrage when he invited Gerry Adams and other members of Sinn Fein to Westminster when there was still blood on the streets of Brighton after the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel.If Labour is ever again going to be a serious opposition party — let alone worthy of government — then the party must never again chose leaders who have spent their careers licking the boots of terrorists.And isn’t it a national disgrace that Tony Blair never sent his “letters of comfort” to OUR boys We all love Sir Paul. But when it comes to Christmas records, give me Bing Crosby, Noddy Holder or The Pogues.In fact, give me anybody but the man who thought “simply having a wonderful Christmastime!” sums up the magic of the season.SUDDENLY the national paralysis is over.You can feel it in the air. You can see it in Boris Johnson’s grin – especially when Jeremy Corbyn is by his side.How quickly the world moves on. How suddenly the new day breaks. How abruptly a catchphrase passes its best-by date.John Bercow’s “ORDER!

Lib Dem, Labour, male, female, anti-Brexit or . . .  actually, they were all anti-Brexit.It didn’t work – just as Steve Coogan telling Brexit supporters that we are ignorant did not make us rush out to vote to stop Brexit.I have come to believe that luvvie endorsements are totally counter-productive.They quite literally have the opposite effect that the smug, self-important thespians hope.The public take one look at Grant and Coogan – then vote exactly the opposite way. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Jo said: Now we know what it is like to live on nothing, we have got used to going without.We have sold everything that we can possibly sell to keep ourselves going, but we just dont know how long we can last like this.At the minute, it looks like we will just be having sandwiches this Christmas, because we cant afford anything  after making sure that our kids have presents and are well cared for.This comes as another young family were forced into debt and had to rely on handouts after having a five-week wait to receive Universal Credit.A spokesperson for North East Lincolnshire Council said: We are in contact with Centre and have met a number of times to explain that we need to make up for the loss of the sports pitch.We have explained this position several times and what we’re doing to try and resolve it.The Council is supportive of the farm, and as landlord would be agreeable to the proposal.However, any sub-lease or change of use is subject to the necessary permissions and whilst we are doing our utmost to resolve the situation, there is a process to follow when someone wants to change the use of a sports field.We are working with Sport England to try to resolve this to allow their objection to the plans to be lted.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work.

But sadly the newest member, ArchieHarrison Mountbatten-Windsor, won’t be there.He will be with his parents Harry and Meghan somewhere in Canada, celebrating away from the royals.That’s a real shame, because with his upbeat presence Harry would have got the Queen laughing over the turkey.I watched the boys grow up, and you couldn’t then get a cigarette paper between them.It will sadden the Queen that Harry is not there and that he doesn’t seem to get on with his brother any more.As a nation, we have huge rts to heal over Brexit. In her traditional Christmas Day speech the Queen will ask the country to come together and heal the wounds.I’m sure one of her priorities in the New Year will not only be to unite the country, but to bring together her beloved grandsons and their wives.But it’s the Epstein outrage that did most to threaten the House of Windsor this year.The Queen must have been horried to watch the car- crash interview Andrew gave to the BBC.With his arrogance and lack of preparation, Andrew — a Falklands War hero — turned what he hoped could have been his redemption into a nightmare.The Queen, with the advice of the Prince of Wales, acted swtly. Andrew was stripped of his royal duties. The institution has to be protected at all times.Of course, it would have been hard for the Queen to do all this, but she did it with calm and with grace, the hallmarks our redoubtable, -year-old monarch.We should not forget this. This remarkable woman continues to serve us when many would have crumbled.You will not hear the slightest grumble from our Queen.Thank heavens for that.While it seems the royals can do no right, the Queen carries on as normal. She rides her Fell pony most weekends and watches the racing on TV and gets excited when she picks a winner.Her family looks to her at times of ision and uncertainty — and so does the nation.The country is polarised over Brexit and one of the things the Queen wants to see is the isions healed and for people to come together in the New Year.Since he retired, the Duke of Edinburgh has lived in Sandringham, so the Queen is rattling around in her apartments with just servants to talk to. She can’t confide in them like she can the Duke. The scandal that has engulfed Prince Andrew will have saddened her so much. But she won’t abandon her son. She loves him.All families face rts and scandals at one time or another. The Windsors are no dferent. Their story is all about continuity, both for the nation and the Royal Family.So the Queen will have loved the recently released new photographs of herself with the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and Prince George preparing a Christmas pudding for charity.It was a royal flush, the Monarch with three generations of heirs. I will be at Sandringham at am tomorrow to photograph theQueen and her family as they arrive at St Mary Magdalene Church.She will pray for the strength to carry on through what are likely to be bumpy roads ahead.And bumps there will be.

Boris’s moving encouragement to British Jews show that he is clearly determined to make them feel at home in the wake of Corbyn’s stunning and very welcome defeat.”He went on to say that his Jewish friends were “stunned” by Boris’ Hanukkah message and that they would have been “frightened” in Britain with a Corbyn win.He added: “If Labour had won, Jews would have been frightened to proclaim their identity.“Boris by contrast celebrates it with them. Thus does Boris heal the country, starting with the Jews.”Mr Shawcross was previously Chairman of the Charity Commission for England and Wales.Boris is such a joy as PM! He has such enthusiasm, he is so bold, he has such marvelous and often funny turns of phrase, and he has such great instincts.Take for example his  minute film greetings to the Jewish people, released yesterday on the feast of Hanukah. It is exuberant, funny, important and very moving.Celebrating Jewishness, Boris said: “ Its really important right now because I know that recent years have not been easy ones for British Jews.“In the media, on the streets and specially online, Anti-Semites in alarming numbers have been emboldened to crawl out from under their rocks and begin to spread their brand of noxious hatred.He did not mention the Labour Party but he did not have to. It is out from under Labour rocks that some of the most vicious British anti-Semites have crawled.Labour used to be the natural home of Britain’s small but hugely vibrant Jewish community of some ,.But since Corbyn became leader, that once great party has been mired in hideous anti-Semitism.The Jewish Labour Movement, affiliated to Labour for almost a hundred years, stated in a recent terrying report, that “Antisemitic behaviour is pervasive at all levels” of Corbyn’s Labour.The report said that the abuse used by some Labour members against Jews - “cockroaches, subhumans, a cancer on the world” was reminiscent of Nazi Germany.Imagine - Dame Margaret Hodge the veteran Jewish MP for Barking said that she faced ”much more” anti-Semitism from the Labour Party than from the BNP !All in all, Jews were so frightened of Labour before the election that % of those polled said they would leave the countryCorbyn won.They would have been wise.Boris’s moving encouragement to British Jews show that he is clearly determined to make them feel at home in the wake of Corbyn’s stunning and very welcome defeat.In his convivial manner, praising the feast Hanukah, he said that he recently had the joy of baking a few latkes and doughnuts when he visited Golders Green during the election.And he pointed out, “Who can argue with a festival where the kids get presents every day of the week.More seriously, he said it was not only the moment to celebrate the miracle of Hanukah itself, “But also your unique identity… to put the Hanukah menorah in the window and say to the world … I am Jewish and I am proud of it.“And that’s really important right now.”Boris is right. If Labour had won, Jews would have been frightened to proclaim their identity.Boris by contrast celebrates it with them.“As you kindle the Hanukah light tonight and in the nights to come I want you to remember this….As Britain’s Jews seek to drive back the darkness of resurgent anti-Semitism….you have every decent person in this country fighting by your side.”Why “ Because Britain would not be Britain without its Jewish community.“And we will stand with you and celebrate with you all year round.”This speech is only two minutes but it is a work of genius. All my Jewish friends are stunned by it – by his humour, his knowledge of their history and his total, positive embrace of their cause.They no longer feel alone and abused.I doubtany Jews will leave now. If the polls are correct, well over , might have fled Corbynism.Thus does Boris heal the country, starting with the Jews.

It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.My family and I are also inspired by the men and women of our emergency services and armed forces and at Christmas we remember all those on duty at home and abroad, who are helping those in need and keeping us and our families safe and secure.Two hundred years on from the birth of my great, great grandmother, Queen Victoria, Prince Philip and I have been delighted to welcome our eighth great grandchild into our family.Of course, at the heart of the Christmas story lies the birth of a child: a seemingly small and insignicant step overlooked by many in Bethlehem.But in time, through his teaching and by his example, Jesus Christ would show the world how small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences and deep-seated isions to bring harmony and understanding.Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps. The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference.As Christmas dawned, church congregations around the world joined in singing It Came Upon The Midnight Clear.Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angels message of peace and goodwill.Its a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation.And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, its worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.And so, I wish you all a very happy Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The  Hunting Act came into force on February ,  – stopping the cruel practice of hunting wild mammals, including foxes, deer and hares, with dogs. However, the ban has failed to prevent hunts meeting to carry out legal drag or trail hunts. Campaigners claim these are a “cover” for foxes to continue to be mauled to death by packs of hounds. The charity said it had received  reports of suspected illegal fox hunting since the season began in late October. Conservative governments have twice tried and failed to overturn the ban. Boris Johnson was forced during the general election campaign to rule out making any changes to the law. That came two-and-a-half years after Theresa May was said to have blundered during the  ballot box race by speaking up for hunts. Drag hunting - where hounds are trained to follow an articial scent -is permitted under the legislation.  More than  Boxing Day hunt meets are taking place across the UK today, with the majority being held in England, according to the Countryside Alliance. As tunic-wearing riders prepare to cry “Tally ho!”, the League Against Cruel Sports demanded the removal of loopholes it claims allow hunts to continue killing foxes. The charity’s director of campaigns Chris Luffingham said: “As they parade today in their gaudy finery, fox hunts will be facing the fact that, with their political support gone, hunting is history. “Their -year campaign to repeal the fox hunting ban hasn’t got a snowball’s chance in hell of success. “There has been a sea change in the way the fox hunting debate is being framed and with the ban now secure, our emphasis has shted towards the strengthening of the Hunting Act.” The League believes the public backs changes to the Act, cracking down on hunts which fail to respect the law. A recent poll showed % of people support keeping the ban on hunting – and the League wants jail terms for those convicted of illegal hunting.  Earlier this year, Labour outlined measures it would launch to strengthen the  Act, introduced by Tony Blair . It published its Animal Welfare Manesto in August, detailing plans for “closing loopholes that allow for illegal hunting of foxes, deer and hares”. Mr Luffingham added: “To end fox hunting for good, the Hunting Act needs to be strengthened by removing the loopholes and exemptions being exploited by the fox hunts to cover up their brutal activities. “The introduction of prison sentences for those convicted of fox hunting would help ensure there is a strong deterrent to prevent the deliberate and widespread chasing and killing of foxes.” Luke Pollard MP, Shadow Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister, said: “Fox hunting is cruel, unnecessary and unpopular. It should be consigned to the history books. “The Prime Minister must ensure his majority is not used to allow theof fox hunting. Labour will use every opportunity to enhance and strengthen the Hunting Act, reviewing penalties to make sure there is an effective deterrent for illegal hunting, and introducing a ‘recklessness’ clause to stop trail hunts being used to kill foxes.” But the pro-hunting Countryside Alliance called on it supporters to flock to meets today. Its website said: “Those opposed to hunting have already stated that they will be lobbying the Government not only to ensure the Act is not overturned, but to insist that it is scrutinised with a view to strengthening it. “Boxing Day meets offer hunts the perfect opportunity to showcase their legal hunting activities to the public. “We need to give the world the chance to understand what makes us all so passionate about following hounds. “Now is the time for the hunting community to work together to ensure we tell our story and let the general public, politicians and hunting’s opponents know why our way of le should be free from attack.” The Alliance’s head of hunting Polly Portwin said: “The Hunting Act never really had anything to do with animal welfare.  “It was a misplaced and prejudiced attack on a group within the rural community by those on the left of politics who think class war is a legitimate aim. “Since the Hunting Act was enforced, hunts have adapted their hunting activities, retained their infrastructure, continued to wear traditional hunt dress and established a long-term and viable future for hunting, all of which has frustrated those who thought hunts would disband following the implementation of the Hunting Act. “The animal rights lobby simply cannot accept that huntsmen wearing red coats survive, regardless of the fact that their actions are legitimate. “One thing that has certainly not benefited from the Hunting Act is animal welfare and it is very telling that the anti-hunting groups that spent £million to push the Act through have not spent a penny on trying to show that it has actually had any benefit.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tens thousands game birds set","story":"NewsTens of thousands of game birds set to be killed today in Boxing Day shootEXCLUSIVE Senior members of the Royal Family are expected to join the annual Boxing Day shoot at Sandringham, Norfolk but campaigners want the \"barbaric\" practise bannedShareByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  DEC NewsPartridges and pheasants are fair game for those hunting \" to FREE daily email alerts from mirror - Royal FamilySubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Landed gentry armed with guns will roam their country estates as they take aim to blast pheasants and partridges out of the sky. Senior members of the Royal Family are expected to join the annual Boxing Day shoot at Sandringham, Norfolk. Campaigners say nearly  million pheasants and partridges are released into the British countryside by the shooting industry every year, compared with only four million in the early s. An estimated , birds face death each day of the shooting season, according to researchers. Enthusiasts can pay thousands of pounds a day for the thrill of plucking birds out of the sky. The League Against Cruel Sports wants the “barbaric” hobby banned. Director of campaigns Chris Luffingham said: “In terms of sheer numbers killed no other ‘sport’ in Britain has such a devastating impact on animals as game bird shooting. “We’ve seen a sht in attitude on fox hunting and overwhelming support for strengthening the ban on this barbaric practice. “Now it’s time for the country to look at the issue of shooting birds for ‘sport’ and to consign it, too, to the history books.” The British Association of Shooting and Conservation said previously: “All over the country, people will be enjoying local shoots during the festive period. “While no game shooting occurs on Christmas Day, the Boxing Day shoot is traditionally a family day and provides a chance to spend the day enjoying the countryside and the company of friends.

Royal Engineer Jimmy Preston – who has been in the army for  years – was originally told he wouldnapost make it home by Christmas. He was meant to be in the middle of a seven-month tour with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards until April.But the Irvine dad-of-three phoned his we Claire and told her he’d be home for December , so they got to work on making a plan to surprise little Emma, Brooke and Leland, reports the Daily Record. They planned to go to Santa’s Grotto at Riverside Lodge Hotel in Irvine, organised by CJ Party Hire, but the kids had no idea their dad would also be there. Claire filmed the special moment as dad Jimmy appeared from behind Santa’s chair with the kids overwhelmingly excited to see him. The video was a big hit online, and Claire and Jimmy were both delighted with the reaction. Claire told the Irvine Herald: “We were told there would be no leave, meaning he wouldn’t be home until April. “So the kids were prepared for him coming home then, but he got given an earlier date. “He missed Christmas two years ago, so the kids knew how it felt and they were preparing for it again. “It wasn’t nice that year, so it was a great surprise for him to come home this time.  “He phoned me and said that he should be home before Christmas. “We decided not to tell the kids, because it may have ended up that he still had to stay. “So we kept it a secret just in case. “We had a think about how we were going to reveal it to the kids, so we decided that Santa’s Grotto was a good idea. “I contacted Riverside Lodge Hotel in Irvine and it was CJ Party Hire who organised the grotto. “We told them our idea and they loved it, they helped plan it all.

Speaking during a podcast with the Hard Business Review, Professor Ashley Whillans said we are too scared to spend more money because it makes us feel guilty. But he thinks ditching stressful activities to free up more time for family and friends, including paying someone to do your laundry or food shopping, wonapost set you back as much as you think. And itaposll make you happier in the long-term. Essentially, parting with cash to stamp out the stresses in our day, or as Professor Whillians puts it: using money to buy ourselves out of negative experiences, reports Business Insider . But by paying more to live closer to work, or for someone to do out washing or cleaning, we are buying time, her studies have found.

The heroes, which include Darryn Frost, , who used a narwhal tusk to hold the crazed kneman at bay, are expected to receive the George Cross or the Queen’s Gallantry Medal. A spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson hinted to Sun Online that they were likely to get their awards next year and described them as: “The very best of the British people.” Mr Frost grabbed the tusk from the wall in Fishmongers’ Hall as Khan launched his frenzied attack that killed Saskia Jones, , and -year-old Jack Merritt and left cores of other innocent people injured last month. John Crilly, , who was on parole after serving  years in jail for manslaughter, battled Khan with a fire extinguisher. Tour guides Thomas Gray, , and Stevie Hurst, ,  and an off-duty plainclothes police officer also helped to disarm or pin down Khan as armed police raced to the scene. Mr Gray has told how he stamped on Khanaposs hand as the killer clutched a kitchen kne. The heroes didnapost know Khanaposs suicide vest was fake when they risked their lives. Mr Hurst said at the time: “I jumped in and kicked him in the head to make him release his kne. A few others did so. Mr Johnson’s spokesman added: “The Prime Minister and the country have huge admiration for the courage they showed.” It is too soon for the men to get their medals in the New Year honours list so they could receive them at the Queen’s Birthday honours next summer or the  New Year’s list. Labour MP Neil Coyle, whose constituency includes London Bridge, said: “Anyone who tries to tackle a terrorist at great risk to themselves should be recognised for the bravery shown.” Originally from Stoke, Khan was a convicted terrorist who had been a member of an al-Qaida-inspired group that plotted to blow up the London Stock Exchange nine years ago.

He was on patrol in Afghanistan on December , , when his tank struck an IED. The blast threw Dean into the air, and he landed on his head, \u2028shattering his armoured helmet, fracturing his skull and inflicting a terrible brain injury. And although the injury ended -year-old Dean’s dream military career he now uses his experience to help soldiers rebuild their lives. He explains: “I genuinely believe my le is better than it would’ve beenI hadn’t been blown up. “You have to have a positive mental attitude and believe your glass is half full. Recovering from my injury wasn’t easy and I had to work at it, but I have achieved so much.” And thanks to his injury Dean, from Seaham, Co Durham, got together with his we. “I knew Jade when I was younger” he says. “She’d qualied as a nurse and came to see how I was.” They have now been married for four years and have a two-year-old son, Max. Dean continues: “When it gets to this time of year it makes me think of how fortunate I am. My we’s birthday is on December  – the same day as my ‘bangiversary’ – so it is a double celebration.” Jade, , was by his side when Dean first walked through the doors of the Help for Heroes Phoenix House recovery centre at Catterick Garrison. The centre provides vital help and support to sick or wounded soldiers and veterans and their families. For many it is a leline to get back on track after suffering physical injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder.  Coronation Street star Antony Cotton is a patron for Help for Heroes and says Dean is a prime example of how the charity can help injured veterans rebuild.Antony says: “I first met Dean in this very gym. He didn’t say much, it was right at the beginning of his recovery. But over the years I have seen immense changes in Deano, not only by being a beneficiary of the services of Help for Heroes, but through now working here. “So when people ask ‘does Help for Heroes work  Do these recovery centres work ’ Well, Dean is a shining example of someone who has gone from suffering a devastating injury to helping others. Everything he built his dreams on was gone in an instant. “I saw him grow in confidence and become a dferent version of himself. He is happy and content. That’s what you hope for everybody who comes through these doors.” Dean, a heavy weapons expert in  Para, was in a Jackal armoured vehicle when it hit the IED. Signaller Corporal Steve Dunn died instantly, the driver broke his wrist while the commander was unhurt.Dean says: “Because I suffered post-traumatic amnesia I don’t have any bad memories of what happened, my family suffered more at the time I think.  “My parents got the dreaded knock from a unormed soldier and they expected the worst. But he was an ex-colleague and assured them I was alive but very seriously injured.” He was flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, where on Boxing Day surgeons removed part of his skull to relieve the pressure on his brain. Dean was put in an induced coma for four months to heal. It was the start of a recovery that would take years. He was also left with a titanium plate in head. He says: “I remember my Regimental Sergeant Major came to visit me in hospital. He asked me how was my numeracy and literacy and I said I didn’t have much upstairs before it anyway, so he said you have still got all your limbs so use them.  “So from that moment I just threw myself into every opportunity that came my way, and I think I have achieved so much post-injury because I had that stupid mentality.” Though Dean admits he struggled at first. “When I learned I was going to be medically discharged I thought what can I do on Civvy Street  Luckily I was a physical training instructor in the Parachute Regiment, so I thought I could train as a personal trainer.

Carpets were replaced with a sea of wrapping paper as their youngest children ripped open their gts, which included cuddly toys, headphones and dolls. Parents-of- Sue and Noel pulled out all the stops to ensure their kids had a very special day - and bought a whopping  items to feed their clan. And this time next year, the family will be even bigger as Sue, , and Noel, , are expecting baby number  - a girl next year. Some of their older children have since moved out the house, however  still live at the family home in Morecambe, Lancashire. The children, wearing festive pyjamas, posed for an adorable photo, with dad Noel even dressed in Christmas pudding pyjamas.Sue also took to Instagram this morning to share snaps of the children opening their presents.She wrote: Merry Christmas everyone. We hope you have the best day ever #bigfamilychristmas #christmas #presents #chaos.  In the pictures their youngest daughter, Bonnie, one, looked overjoyed as she sat in a small ball pit. Earlier this week, we reported how Sue had left fans in awe after surprising her children with festive bedroom makeovers. The bedrooms were transformed into mini-grottos with cute festive bedding on all the beds and a tree which lights up the room.  Above the fireplace of their impressive -bedroom home were  stockings ready to be filled and then demolished on December . The Radfords first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting.Baby Bonnie was the last addition to the brood last November bringing the number of children to a whopping . She arrived after a swt  minute labour weighing lb oz - and the couple, who have been having children for three decades, vowed she would be their last and had completed their family. However, they are now expecting another baby girl in the new year. They live with the majority of their kids in a -bed, four-storey Victorian property, a former care home, which they bought almost  years ago.  Sue and Noel run their own pie business and do not claim extra state benefits. Some of the oldest offspring have since moved out and started families of their own with Sue and Noel being grandparents to four. The Radford children are: Chris, , Sophie, , Chloe, , Jack, , Daniel, , Luke, , Millie, , Katie, , James, , Ellie, , Aimee, , Josh, , Max, , Tillie, eight, Oscar, seven, Casper, six, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, and Archie, two, and Bonnie, one.  Bonnie had the same due date as Alfie who was stillborn in . After Archie was born, the couple said it was strange knowing he would be their last. And when the entire family appeared on ITVaposs This Morning in January , Sue said: Archie is definitely going to be the last Radford baby.  But eldest daughter Sophie, who has three kids herself, shook her head and claimed she canapost see her mum stopping - and she wasnapost wrong as months later Sue fell pregnant with Bonnie. Childhood sweethearts Sue and Noelaposs first child, Chris, was born when Sue was aged just . The parents were both given up for adoption after they were born, and they decided to keep Chris and raise him as teenage parents. They got married and had their second child, Sophie, when Sue was .  Noel even had a vasectomy, later reversed, after baby number nine. The pair face a monumental task each day just to feed, clothe and ferry about their huge brood. They spend an estimated £, a year of their own money bringing up their children - including birthdays with a reported budget of £ per child and Christmas at £ to £ per child.

It would be lovely to end  on a high note, but the season of goodwill was over in less time than it takes to polish off a box of Quality Street. It’s depressing to be heading into  where black footballers continue to be racially abused while doing their job and where one of our brightest musical talents is racially abused for suggesting racism still exists in Britain. Last weekend, so-called fans during the match between Tottenham and Cha had to be warned three times to stop the abuse, after the Blue’s Antonio Rudiger was racially targeted. Less than  hours earlier, Stormzy was being trolled for saying that, definitely, %, there is racism in Britain. He didn’t say every person in Britain is racist – he was misquoted as saying that and he rightly used his  to set the record straight. The disheartening thing about these rows time and time again is how quickly people who experience racism are gaslighted by those who have never experienced it. The latter group scream the loudest about how much it doesn’t exist in their opinion and then go on to talk about how tolerant they are. Why should you get a prize for being more willing to put up with people who don’t look like you  Being less racist isn’t enough. Tolerance isn’t enough – we need to accept and embrace our dferences. Football pundit Gary Neville wasn’t afraid to blast the game’s top brass for not doing enough to protect players.  But he’s right when he suggests the behaviour of Prime Minister Boris Johnson – who thinks it’s OK to say Muslim women look like letterboxes and call black people “piccaninnies” with “watermelon smiles” – coupled with an opposition who failed to tackle anti-Semitism, emboldens racists to spew their bile. This year, on a personal level, was one of the toughest I’ve experienced in a long time. But professionally it was one of the most rewarding. I got to spend most of my time working with incredible people who have achieved so much in their careers and are all at the top of their fields.  They’re quietly changing perceptions of what people think of when they imagine a CEO, a founder of a multi-national company or leading entertainment brand. They all happen to be of African, Caribbean and African ­American heritage.

Her comments follow a year which has seen young people inspired to become environmental campaigners by the example of schoolgirl activist Greta Thunberg. During her annual address the Queen acknowledged the bumpy path her family and the country has faced during the past  months, but mentioned some of the positives like the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussexaposs first child. She highlighted how often small steps, not the giant leaps bring about lasting change in the world - the theme of her Christmas Day broadcast. The Queen said the Christmas message of peace and goodwill still has relevance today - a comment which follows a year of bitter debates in Parliament and the country over Brexit . She said the message was a reminder of what can be achieved when people abandon their dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. Her words are likely to be interpreted as an appeal for the healing of isions in the country as Britain leaves the EU. The Queen said in her message: The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate. Swedish teenager Gretaaposs activism has sparked a global climate strike movement that has seen millions of youngsters across the world protest by refusing to go to classes. She addressed a UN summit on the issue in September, telling world leaders they had failed to act. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words, she said. Her efforts were acknowledged by the Duke of Cambridge who said climate activists were ringing the planetary alarm bell louder. The Queen also spoke about personal joy, describing how she and the Duke of Edinburgh were delighted to welcome an eighth great-grandchild to their family - Harry and Meghanaposs son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - born  years after Queen Victoria. As the Queen spoke viewers saw a photograph, released a few days after Archieaposs birth on May , which captured the moment she and the Duke of Edinburgh saw Archie for the first time as his proud parents and grandmother Doria Ragland looked on.  The Christmas message, produced by the BBC, was recorded in Windsor Castleaposs green drawing room after the General Election but before Philip was admitted to a private London hospital for treatment for a pre-existing but undisclosed condition. The duke spent four nights being treated before he was discharged on Christmas Eve morning, in time to join the royal family celebrations at Sandringham. In her message to the country and Commonwealth the Queen mentioned the carol It Came Upon The Midnight Clear - performed at the end of the broadcast. She added: Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angelsapos message of peace and goodwill. Itaposs a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation. And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, itaposs worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change. A string of milestones marked during  were mentioned by the Queen, from the th anniversary of the D-Day landings to the th anniversary of the first moon landing. She began her address by highlighting its theme of small steps as she spoke about the Apollo  mission.  As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind, said the Queen. She added: Itaposs a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps. Nearby was a picture of the Queen meeting Armstrong and his Apollo  crewmates Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. Speaking about D-Day, the Queen mentioned the look of concern on my fatheraposs face as King George VI knew about the secret plans but could not share that burden. Seventy-five years on from the historic landings, she said former enemies had met in friendship at commemorations marking the anniversary in Britain and on the continent. The Queen added: Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps. Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides. By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost. During the broadcast footage was shown of Americaaposs moon landings, national D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, and world leaders meeting the Queen during the recent Nato reception at Buckingham Place, which marked the allianceaposs th anniversary. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were featured at a French D-Day service in Bayeux, Normandy, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were shown celebrating St Patrickaposs Day with the Irish Guards. Speaking about how Jesus showed the world that small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences, the Queen added: Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps. The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference. The Queenaposs comment about experiencing a bumpy year is thought to be her first public reference to the personal events involving her family during the past  months. During , the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye, and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with a convicted sex offender. The Queen also paid tribute to the men and women of the emergency services and the armed forces, and remembered those on duty this Christmas working to keep the nation safe and secure. At the end of the broadcast footage was shown of the Queen, Charles, William and Prince George preparing Christmas puddings earlier this month at Buckingham Palace for the Royal British Legionaposs Together at Christmas initiative.

The cap was found in the pool pump system by investigators trying to discover why all three members of the same family died on Christmas Eve, local paper Diario Sur reports. The recovery of the cap supports the theory that there could have been a suction problem in the pool that turned it into a into a death trap. The nine-year-old girl is believed to have been in dficulties in the pool and her brother and dad jumped in to help her. However the exact circumstances of their deaths remained a mystery as resort chiefs said they had been given permission to reopen the pool at the Club La Costa World complex near Fuengirola. Have you been affected by this story  Email webnews@mirror They claim a police investigation had found “no concerns” with it. Speculation is growing that the family may have died during a temporary suction problem caused by a freak accident which had nothing to do with a problem with the pool or could have been foreseen. But police have yet to make any further comment about the triple tragedy as they are keeping an open mind on the cause and “all options” were on the table. Autopsies performed at Malaga’s Institute of Forensic Medicine have confirmed the girl and her -year-old brother and -year-old dad all drowned.  Pathologists found no signs of any external injuries, or evidence they had been poisoned. The girlaposs -year-old sister who had been swimming with her sibling shortly before the tragedy has shown no signs of chlorine poisoning. The girls’ parents are understood to have found the nine-year-old in dficulties under the water after rushing to the pool when the older girl ed to their holiday apartment alone and they quizzed her on her sister’s whereabouts. A witness told how the mum, believed to be from London, “stayed calm” and prayed by their bodies to try to will them back to le as he performed CPR with resort staff on the three tourists.  Dad-of-three Josias Fletchman, from Manchester, said in a moving account of how he tried to save them: “The mum was praying for them to come back to le. “She was calm. She was touching their bodies. She continued praying even after the ambulance people arrived and had stopped trying to revive them. “She exercised her faith to the limit. I was performing CPR on her husband but I’m a believer and I prayed as well. “She strengthened me in the way she reacted. It just wasn’t meant to be.”  Resort chiefs said the Civil Guard, the police force leading the investigation into the triple tragedy, had given them permission to reopen the pool which is one of several on the sprawling holiday complex but was not used much because it was not heated. Resort operator CLC World Resorts and Hotels put out a statement which said: “All at Club La Costa World resort are devastated by the tragedy that unfolded on Christmas Eve where a father and his two children were found unresponsive in a swimming pool and despite the best efforts of our first response team and the emergency services, could not be revived. “The Guardia Civil have carried out a full investigation which found no concerns relating to the pool in question or procedures in place, which leaves us to believe this was a tragic accident which has left everyone surrounding the incident in shock. “Naturally our primary concern remains the care and support of the remaining family members.  “We would therefore request that their privacy be respected at this traumatic time.” They also confirmed the Civil Guard had authorised the reopening of the pool in what will be seen as a clear sign police feel there is no risk to bathers of a repeat of the horror. The reopening is believed to have been sanctioned after the pool circulation system including the skimmers and pump were found to be working perfectly during tests performed after the tragic loss of le. Civil Guard investigators have yet to make any official comment on the swimming cap find, made by specialist police ers mobilised after the alarm was raised around .pm on Christmas Eve.  Local media reports say a resort worker who ed into the water to recover the three bodies has said he had also experienced dficulties reaching the surface and exiting the pool. A pool expert quoted by Diario Sur described as “very remote” but not impossible a situation in which pool drains on the pool floor could become dangerous and suck people underwaterskimmers and other cleaners stopped working.

Musician Elina Valiyeva, , was found by her boyfriend in the bathroom of a vacation rental flat in the Hungarian capital. Her unnamed Russian boyfriend is now in a toxicological hospital being treated for serious but not le-threatening gas poisoning, according to local reports.

Rest in peace.”The professor - one of Russia’s top pianists - said her death raised many questions and called for a thorough investigation.She earlier studied at the world famous Moscow State Tchaikovsky Conservatory and her career was about to take off, her professor said. He told RIA Novosti: “She was a very talented pianist, receiving three international awards in the past three years. “In March , she had planned a tour in Japan. It all ended at the dawn of her career.“This was the period when she was about to fly high. It is an enormous tragedy.” Her brother Rishat Valiyev said that Elinaaposs boyfriend found her dead and called an ambulance. Other reports said she was alive but unconscious when he found her. Hungarian reports say police do not suspect foul play and have not opened a criminal investigation.

An expert found wolf prints and a second wounded marsupial at the property in Balen, north-east Belgium, after the pet vanished. Kangaroos are native to Australia, but are able to be kept as pets in parts of Europe.Wolves are spread throughout continental Europe, but the BBC reports sightings of the animals are increasing after years of their numbers being depleted by widespread hunting.Wolf expert Jan Loos was called to the property by the owners and said he told them their pet was probably dead. He said the animal had most likely been snatched by the wolf and eaten, noting the second wounded kangaroo and wolf prints at the scene. No remains of the kangaroo were found. Mr Loos, who is a director of Wolf and wildle centre Landschap, told AFP he believed a wolf that has been seen since August could be behind the kangarooaposs disappearance.  The predator had been spotted roaming in the area and across the German board. Mr Loos said: I found wolf prints, so itaposs quite sure itaposs a wolf, but weaposre not  per cent sure which wolf.

We were flying as well at that time but the form goes out the window in a derby.“It’s a one-off game. The last two have been good for us and we need to we bring our A game and, fingers crossed, it goes our way.”He added: “The run we’ve been on isn’t an easy thing to do.“Thankfully, we’ve gone through the whole second quarter of the season winning every game.“You can only be delighted with that, getting maximum points.“We’re looking to kick that on to the next quarter and we start that off with a derby on Friday, which is vitally important to get a result.”Shankland says the Tangerines have taken confidence from Saturday’s -

the Danestone Country Park, in the hope that families and iniduals alike will be able to enjoy it in the warmer months.There are big plans in place for the wooded site, which runs between Danestone and Grandholm, which has been split into three dferent phases.The first involves the clearing of some of the more overgrown parts of the country park.Aberdeen City Council workers helped out to tidy up the area, to assist the volunteers in getting it ready for the future, with proposals including installing benches and fairy doors.Chairman of the Danestone Community Council Derek Davidson said: “We were very lucky, the council cleared the outside for us, which we asked them to do a few months ago.“It helps us to be able to put in the bits and pieces that we want to, such as fairy doors.“We also want to put in benches and do more on a long-term basis.“I’ve requested two, but we might get four, benches from Union Terrace gardens to go in.“There’ll be new ones going into the park and they don’t need the old ones any more, so we’ve secured a few of those.“We’ll definitely be getting two, but hopefully we can get four.“We’re also looking at getting some orchard trees in as well.”It’s hoped that by opening up the park, it will encourage more people to use the shops and facilities at Grandholm, which are all locally owned, as well as generally inviting people into the area again.It’s proposed that the fairy doors might go up in the wooded area as soon as spring or summer next year.Derek added: “We want to see people starting to use the area again.“There’s a few shops in Grandholm andwe could get the park up and running it might encourage more people into the area and help local businesses.”As well as creating a welcoming area, the community council has larger plans afoot, which it is currently working on drumming support up for.It is also at the stage that it is looking for funding for the initiative.Anyone interested in volunteering to support the initiative is

challenged the Reds to end  with a bang by overcoming Livingston and Hearts.The Dons host in-form Livi today before travelling to Tynecastle on Sunday for the final game before the Premiership goes into a winter shutdown.Aberdeen will jet out to Dubai during the break for a warm weather training camp.However, McInnes wants to end the year with six points to keep the pressure on third-placed Motherwell in the Premiership.McInnes said: “We want to finish the year as strong as possible.“We are the home side against Livingston and I don’t want us to just win, I want us to play well and attack the game.“Two wins would keep us up there in the table with where we normally are going into the winter break with the hope we can improve when we come back in January.“We want to get the two wins and we knowwe bring the performance we are capable of that.”Livingston are five games undefeated and will arrive at Pittodrie today buoyed by an emphatic - defeat of Ross County.They also recently defeated Kilmarnock - away and have drawn with Hearts, St Mirren and Hamilton in their unbeaten run.McInnes will have his squad on red alert as to the dangers posed by Livi on two fronts – both as an attacking and physical force.McInnes said: “When you play against Livingston you have to compete and deal with their energy, physicality and limit their service.“You have to be able to stand up to that, which is fine – that is part of football.“There are also times when you have to ask the question of Livingston to defend.”Aberdeen defeated Livingston - away in September and McInnes admits it was a tough task to secure the victory.He is expecting more of the same in today’s festive fixture.McInnes said: “Livingston will be tough although we had a good record against them last year.“Every game is tough.“I admire a lot about what they do.“Livingston are in good form as they are unbeaten in five and have scored plenty of goals.“We had a very dficult and challenging game against them earlier in the season.“It wasn’t pretty but we got the job done.“Every time you play Livingston you have to do a lot of things right to try to gain the initiative.“You still also have to play well when in possession of the ball.“I just watched their game with Ross County on Tuesday morning and Livingston can do that“When they do everything right they can be a formidable side.“They have good footballers, they can be robust and have plenty of energy.“The fact they are on such a great run you have to respect that.“Hopefully we can still come out with three points.”Aberdeen will call time on  with a trip to Tynecastle on Sunday. The Dons suffered a disappointing League Cup quarter-final exit at the ground to Hearts earlier this season.The struggling Jambos are bottom of the Premiership table and have recently appointed former Barnsley boss Daniel Stendel as their new manager.Stendel has lost all three games since taking the reins at the Jambos.McInnes said: “Against Hearts hopefully we can go to Tynecastle and finish  with three points.“The target is to win six points out of six although Hearts have obviously been a tough nut to crack for us at Tynecastle.“We go into those games having taken a lot of positives from the game against Celtic at Parkhead on Saturday.”"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line.

Fishing was slow at first with roughly an hour passing before the first catch came aboard, but after that it was non-stop until lunchtime.The quality of spurs and whiting was better than expected with very few undersized caught. Most made the measure and on average spurs hit the -cm mark with a couple of decent ones coming in at cm tipping the scales at lbs oz.As the day progressed the weather deteriorated with heavy showers, hail and really strong gusts spinning the boat leading to the inevitable Etive tangles.A decision was made to cut the day short and lines up was called at pm.Given the conditions everyone coped well and at the end of the day four species, spurs, whiting, lsd and pouting, added to the tally of  counting fish.Highlight of the day were the two sea eagles that flew in quite close on the hunt for food but they had their work cut out with so many greedy gulls around. Food wasn’t an issue for the boys though with homemade soup, tablet, shortbread and ginger wine all hitting the spot.Back ashore and the scores tallied up, the winner of this year’s Christmas Shield was Gordon Law with Robert MacBrayne in second place.

just two years.Persecution of the iconic birds as well as changes in land use had led to numbers dropping across the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in recent decades.Ahead of the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project being launched almost two years ago it was believed that there were only two-to-four breeding pairs left across the whole area.Conservationists had identied enough habitat spread across the two rural local authority regions to comfortably cater for as many as  birds.Eaglets were taken from nests in the north of Scotland by ornithologists to prepare for release in the south.In early  five custom built aviaries were constructed in the Southern Upland hills to allow the first of the eaglets to become accustomed to the new territory.While the work of bringing a new generation of golden eagles to the Borders continued, outreach officers staged school and community visits to provide education on the endangered species.This month, with four eagles now successfully introduced to the south of Scotland, bosses at the project revealed that , people have now supported their work by either volunteering or taking part in the outreach sessions.Philip Munro, community outreach officer for the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project, told us: ldquoIt is fantastic to see so many people are so passionate about protecting this iconic species in the south of Scotland.\"We are absolutely delighted with the support, which plays an absolutely vital role in protecting golden eagles.\"We need to keep building on this so that we can ensure that we can see even more of these magnicent birds across the south of Scotlandrsquos skies for generations to come.Funded by Heritage Lottery and LEADER Scottish Borders and DG, the project aims to bring together all countryside users to ensure the wellbeing and successful future of the eagles in the south of Scotland and to secure its place for the future.Those who have participated in the initiative, ranging from four-years-old up to , come from a range of backgrounds and organisations, including the UKrsquos first ever Golden Eagle Scout Champions at the Scottish Borders Scouts, over  pupils from primary schools across the south of Scotland and one in the Scottish Highlands, Borders College, the Scottish Raptor Study Group, Kielder Bird of Prey Centre, HMP Dumfries, and local businesses like Wild Tree Adventures.Earlier this year, the Philiphaugh Estate near Selkirk also announced that it plans to open a Golden Eagle Centre which will support the projectrsquos conservation and community engagement work.Francesca Osowska, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos chief executive, said: ldquoThis is a fantastic milestone.\"Golden eagles are such an amazing part of Scotlandrsquos bioersity, and an integral part of building a nature-rich country for us all.\"Wersquore passionate about ing golden eagles to places where they used to be plentul ndash and it looks like we have thousands of people on our side!\"A huge thank you to all the wonderful volunteers and project participants.The first four birds which were moved to the area have settled into their new habitats and are now fending for themselves.Support from volunteers and participants plays a pivotal role in helping the iconic species continue to grow and thrive in the area.One volunteer was shortlisted as Student of the Year by the Scottish Rural College, largely for her work on the project.Charlotte Martin, a Countryside Management student at SRUC, first heard about the Project when Philip Munro delivered a talk at the college.She said: ldquoHaving previously worked in areas where golden eagles were part of the fabric of the area and very much accepted and admired, alongside my career in farming with employers who farmed commercially yet with great respect for wildle, I was very excited by the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos aims.\"I badgered the project team to let me volunteer and have since been helping at public engagement events, which I thoroughly enjoy.As well as colleges, the outreach team have also visited many schools across the Borders.Michelle Hoppeacute, principal teacher for Yarrow  Kirkhope Primary Schools, said: ldquoWe were really excited to be one of the first schools to take part in the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Projectrsquos Eagle Schools initiative.\"It really brought our community together and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.\"The children have had the most amazing experience.\"We are incredibly proud of the interest our pupils have shown in protecting this majestic and important bird.

He added: #But you can be sure of our desire to stay.#An outstanding relationship has been built up with the local people, and it is a perfect location, with great training facilities.#It is understood that no alternative location for the unit has been identied yet.And RAF spokesman said there had been talks with the US military about the withdrawal.#The future of the base is under continuing review and the departure of the US Navy is not the only factor which has to be taken into account.#In June RAF Machrihanish was reduced to #care and maintenance# status.FIFTY YEARS AGOShellfish plant operationalCampbeltown at last has a stake in the new, growing shellfish processing industry.Two local men, Mr George McMillan and Mr Duncan L. McMillan, have set up a processing plant in the former slaughterhouse buildings, and are employing, at present, three people.Operating under the name Davaar Seafoods, they are consigning to Aberdeen an average of  stones of processed scallops per day. This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Lockie, which left France on Sunday, arrived at the headquarters of the battalion at Dunoon about mid-day on Monday.They were given a hearty welcome when they landed at Dunoon, the Provost, Magistrates and Town Council receiving them officially.Maclachlan of Maclachlan, convener of the county, Colonel H. Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time. It was a great movie anyway and anyone who hadn#t heard about it should seek it out to watch.Ron Gay,Dunoon.Broken promiseSir,The Scottish Accident and Emergencywaiting time target has been missed by a long way for yet another month, with only . per cent of patients treated within  hours in September compared to the  per cent target.Doctors and nurses work incredibly hard, but they’re hindered by the SNP government’s poor workforce planning. Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

It came after representatives of the local industries which discharge their waste effluents into the main sewage system indicated that they would be willing to co-operate in the neutralising of the acids in their effluents.Without neutralising the acid would prove damaging to the pumps envisaged for the new scheme.The motion calling on the council to give the go-ahead on the project was made by Dean of Guild William Stevenson, and seconded by Councillor N. S. McCallum, who said: #I think health comes before money in this respect.#Fears were expressed about the effect the scheme would have on the rates. Councillor Alastair McKinlay said: #It might be that in years to come we, as a council, will be blamed for putting the rates up.#Provost Daniel McKinven said that the efforts made in the past to secure the new sewage system for Campbeltown were #joint efforts#. The Provost said that the council had #done this for the good of Campbeltown# and that they would #see to it# that local labour is employed on the actual scheme.Mr W. P. Scott, the representative at the meeting of Messrs. Crouch and Hogg, the firm of consulting engineers who will be employed on the project, said that the pumping main would probably be laid along under the Low Askomel road.Mr Scott commented that the most expensive part of the scheme will be the actual laying of the pipelines.Hon. Treasurer George Halbert and Town Chamberlain, Mr William B. Allen, calculated that the rates may have to be increased by s d to cover the cost of the scheme. But Mr Halbert pointed out that the increase may be considerably more.The final calculation will not be made until Messrs. Crouch and Hogg supply a final figure for the cost of the scheme.The town will be eligible for a rates support grant.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGOHighland Parish Church ChoirOn Wednesday night the choir of the Highland Parish Church gave a concert in the Kirk Street Hall in aid of the funds of the Women#s Guild.The audience quite filled the hall, and a most enjoyable programme was received with every indication of appreciation.The choir contributed two-part songs which were rendered tunefully and with fine feeling, and the audience responded with particular warmth.The vocal solos by members of the choir were all most successfully rendered.The songs were nicely selected and several singers, heard for the first time, performed with great taste and sweetness.The soloists were Misses Macalpine, L.

It is a scary premonition.ldquoYoursquore just getting old, was a recent diagnosis from a family member! It was said with affection, of course, yet the ring of truth gave it an unhelpful sting. Age, of course, is just a number and state of mind and I have much to keep me youthful.What did help was meeting up with an old friend last week. As we sat together sharing memories of our youth and the shenanigans we got up to  years ago, I had a disorientating sense of time. It seemed impossible that so many years had passed since the moments we remembered had taken place. Those moments were so present for us. As another clicheacute says, it was asit was yesterday.We both complimented each other on how young we looked but I think this was because we both saw the younger person underneath the wrapping made by time. Society judges so much by appearance, we all do. But when we meet an old friend, even when we have not been in touch for many years, we see the person we knew, eventhe exterior has changed. As the philosopher Henry David Thoreau once said: ldquoItrsquos not what you look at that matters, itrsquos what you see.Who can say honestly they have not judged someone because of what they look like  I am as guilty as anyone . As I said, we all do it on the bus, in the queue at the supermarket while we wait our turn, everywhere. We glimpse at people, avoiding eye contact, but making immediate judgement on the way they look. Sometimes itrsquos negative, sometimes envious, sometimes positive and admiring but always superficial. And I know, like everyone , I too am likewise judged.Itrsquos a human habit, perhaps a primeval instinct in which we must quickly judge people for our safety. But of course outward appearance gives no clue to someonersquos character and real qualities. We must know something of that person first before we can judge on that.And this means seeing beyond what we look at. And to do this we need eye contact, a smile, a friendly gesture and the exchange of some words. We need to connect to the person inside. And the irony is, while there are more of us than ever sharing ever-bigger spaces, we are ever more disconnected from each other.The truth Irsquove come to realise is that you donrsquot have to be an old friend with someone to see their inner self, you just need to see beyond what appears to you. We have another primeval instinct and that is to detect the warmth of a character. But we cannot do thatwe only see what we look at and make no attempt to connect.My resolution, even before New Year, is to do this more often. To smile, say some friendly words and not judge or assume things. I think we actually all need more of this, with people we donrsquot know as much as those we do.As someone once said, a stranger is a friend you havenrsquot met yet. Well maybe you have, but you just havenrsquot spoken to them or really seen them for who they are."},{"url":null,"title":"hometown-clubs-special-honour-golf-star-catriona-matthew","story":"They gave Catriona, who is from the town, the membership in celebration of her victorious Solheim Cup captaincy at this yearrsquos competition, which was held at Gleneagles in September.Stuart Martin, golf operations manager at North Berwick Golf Club, said: ldquoThe club was absolutely delighted when she was given the [Solheim Cup] captaincy.ldquoEveryone was delighted for her when she won the Solheim Cup, especially since she has been related to North Berwick Golf Club for so many years.ldquoGiving her the honorary le membership was a no-brainer ndash everyone was delighted for it to go through.Catriona has been a member of North Berwick Golf Club since , when she was just  years old.On Catrionarsquos reaction to being given the honorary le membership, Stuart added: ldquoShe was just delighted and thanked everyone for being there.ldquoShe talked a little bit about her history growing up playing on the West Links, which led to her going on to do bigger and better things on the European Tour and her experience at the Solheim Cup.The club also announced it was renaming its East Lounge, located on the top floor of the clubhouse, the Catriona Matthew Lounge.Mr Martin added: ldquoShe was a little bit shocked to hear we were renaming the lounge after her.ldquoShersquos quite a private person and keeps herself to herself but she was delighted to receive both of these recognitions."},{"url":null,"title":"consultation-proposed-transport-hub-haddington-branded-shambolic","story":"Protests are expected to take place outside Haddington Town House on Monday evening when the proposals are put to the public.And angry business owners are also planning to place banners outside the townrsquos General Election polling station at the Aubigny Centre today .In recent weeks, East Lothian Council has repeatedly changed plans for a public consultation on a controversial proposal for a new car park east of the town centre. One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is

everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended

It has also previously been identied that the Coastguard site could potentially provide parking for any new flats in the Assembly Rooms.A metal staircase linking the car park to the adjacent Church Street and the town centre is also included as part of the proposals.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had mixed thoughts on the scheme.She said: ldquoLargely, there is a demand for parking.ldquoHowever, these car parking spaces would require traffic to move past a very small group of cottages that have enjoyed a degree of privacy in effectively a cul-de-sac all the time they have been there.ldquoInitial messages I have had from residents are of horror.ldquoThe prospect is that green space will be tarmacked over and become a pretty signicant car parking lot.The spokeswoman for the local authority highlighted the proposed car park was part of a wider project surrounding parking in the town.She said: ldquoThe project that transportation is considering has nothing to do with the Assembly Rooms but rather a straight forward look at available space to act as long stay and to change Abbeylands parking to short stay.ldquoThe council is currently negotiating with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to increase the capacity of the rail station car park to stop indiscriminate parking on local streets.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road. Hopefully the improvements will manage that well.ldquoI continue to have concerns about developments being put in place with inadequate attention to overall infrastructure needs and the impact on surrounding residents.Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, added: ldquoThough we do not want this amount of housing in this location, we hope that the improved junction will channel much of the traffic generated onto the A and away from Musselburgh.ldquoThere are already serious traffic problems at the bottom end of Monktonhall Road and at the Tesco roundabout. Evenjust some of the traffic from the development around QMU comes this way to access facilities in Musselburgh, we fear the road system will clog up totally.ldquoWe have no problem with the junction improvements.

Like its parent ldquopolitically correct, woke is a passion of the urban left. It is PC for the age of LGBTQIA+. suggested ldquowoke as word of the year, which arguably it should be, though not for the reason it thinks. For woke has changed meaning in the last  months, and become a term of derision, referring to a style of self-righteous, right-on thinking favoured by, well,columnists. It is now used to denote the metropolitan identity politics that contributed to Labourrsquos greatest defeat since the s.:Guy Stenhouse: Time to Get Over itNo-one is sure where the word ldquowoke came from, except that it emerged from African-American vernacular for ldquostaying alert, as in ldquostay woke, brother. In recent years it was adopted by the BlackLivesMatter movement with their hashtag #staywoke ndash meaning keeping black issues uppermost on social media.It was soon adopted by white millennials to emblemise not just racial awareness but a whole identitarian outlook on le. Woke expresses the ultra-feminist, multi-ethnic, gender non-conforming culture fashionable in American and UK campuses.Woke people love people of colour and loathe ldquostraight white males, ldquogammon and ldquoboomers. They adore so-called ldquonon-binary people who claim not to identy with any gender. No-one is quite sure what non-binary means. Do they swing both ways  No, thatrsquos bisexual. Are they transgender  Definitely not, and nor are they intersex. Itrsquos one of lersquos mysteries to many folk who are less woke.Wokeness has recently taken the media and advertising world by storm. Companies eager to keep up with the zeitgeist waste no chance to wave the rainbow flag and include multi-ethnic themes. This is sometimes called ldquowoke-washing. Every TV advert from McDonaldrsquos to John Lewis now has to feature a multi-racial family, asthe advertisers believe having two white people on one sofa is racism.The BBC drama Years And Years was kind of Woke Family Robinson. Black professhysional mother, transshygender daughter, gay cousin, asylum-seeker boyfriend, disabled sister ... all fighting the good fight against the emerging fascism of Brexit Britain. This compendium of woke identitarianism came complete with a middle-aged white dad. He naturally emerged as a morally worthless, adulterous creep, fit only to be punished by losing all his money.: Mark Smith: Happy Christmas First Minister ndash here are some questions I think you should answerWoke is easy to satirise and has been, mercilessly, by the comedian Andrew Doyle with his social media creation, Titania McGrath. She is a -year-old middle-class gender studies graduate, obsessed by her imagined victimhood, who identies as an ecosexual, non-binary person of colour and fights for social justice by writing bad poetry. ldquoThe only thing thatrsquos white about me, says Titania, ldquois my skin.She firmly believes women can have penises and that people should have electronic chips inserted in their brains to report heterosexual thinking. Men who have sexual dreams are guilty of rape, according to Titania.Woke folk thought Titania was the product of the homophobic, alt-right, fascist MSMndash or did until her creator, a gay Labour voter, was exposed last year. She is one of the great satirical creations of the century, just donrsquot expect Doyle to get invited on to The Mash Report.Woke is no joke. The leftrsquos penchant for strict identity politics, and the exotic fringes of LGBTQIA+ has had political consequences. The social media assault on ldquowhite working-class Brexit voters as racists and bigots was a factor in the alienation of traditional Labour constituencies. People in Bolsover, Workington and Sedgefield donrsquot much like being portrayed as fascists. Who knew There is a sanctimoniousness and intolerance about woke culture that is itself sometimes redolent of the authoritarian right, especially its approach to language. Anyone who mistakenly says ldquocoloured people instead of ldquopeople of colour, for example, will be ostracised. Pronouns must be obeyed. Feminist academics are no-edthey question whether transwomen are biologically female.Barack Obama warned the Democratic Party to avoid this ldquowoke politics with its ldquocancel culture. This is the practice of social justice warriors on Twitter demonising anyone who fails to conform to their particular form of non-conformism. If Trump wins again, it will in part because the Democrats havenrsquot listened.There is an anti-science, quasi-religious aspect to woke. Woke biology insists that sex is not innate but is ldquoattributed at birth ndash asevery child is born transgender. During the General Election campaign, the Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson tried, with disastrous results, to defend the woke dogma that biological sex doesnrsquot exist.Woke wars are raging in the Scottish National Party and have been since Nicola Sturgeon declared her support for self-ID ndash a law change to allow transgender people to self-identy as women without the need for medical intervention or convincing evidence that they have lived as women.There has been a vigorous reaction against this from feminists in and out of the SNP. They fear womenrsquos refuges, changing rooms and prisons are liable to be invaded by men declaring themselves to be female. They also resent being called ldquocis by wokeasians, aswomen are merely a subset of their own sex.The General Election has not caused any obvious soul-searching among the woke cadres. Indeed, the verdict ofwriter Paul Mason was a pitch-perfect expression of the woke worldview. The election was, he declared, ldquoa victory of the old over the young racists over people of colour selfishness over the planet.Such is the firm belief of the morally superior who spend their lives in an echo chamber saving the world from imagined hate crimes. It will take more than a landslide defeat to persuade them otherwise."},{"url":null,"title":"queen-reflects-bumpy-path-addresses-nation","story":"During , the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with a convicted sex offender.Camleys Cartoon: Annus horribilis...

family and the country has faced during the past  months, but mentioned some of the positives like the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Sussexs first child.She highlighted how often \"small steps, not the giant leaps\" bring about lasting change in the world - the theme of her Christmas Day broadcast.: Christmas Day baby joy for parents across ScotlandThe Queen said the Christmas message of peace and goodwill still has relevance today - a comment which follows a year of bitter debates in Parliament and the country over Brexit.She said the message was a reminder of what can be achieved when people abandon their dferences and \"come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation\".Her words are likely to be interpreted as an appeal for the healing of isions in the country as Britain leaves the EU.The Queen said in her message: \"The challenges many people face today may be dferent to those once faced by my generation, but I have been struck by how new generations have brought a similar sense of purpose to issues such as protecting our environment and our climate.\"Swedish teenager Gretas activism has sparked a global climate strike movement that has seen millions of youngsters across the world protest by refusing to go to classes.She addressed a UN summit on the issue in September, telling world leaders they had failed to act.\"You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,\" she said.: Royals join Queen for Christmas Day church serviceHer efforts were acknowledged by the Duke of Cambridge who said climate activists were ringing the \"planetary alarm bell louder\".The Queen also spoke about personal joy, describing how she and the Duke of Edinburgh were \"delighted\" to welcome an eighth great-grandchild to their family - Harry and Meghans son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor - born  years after Queen Victoria.As the Queen spoke viewers saw a photograph, released a few days after Archies birth on May , which captured the moment she and the Duke of Edinburgh saw Archie for the first time as his proud parents and grandmother Doria Ragland looked on.The Christmas message, produced by the BBC, was recorded in Windsor Castles green drawing room after the General Election but before Philip was admitted to a private London hospital for treatment for a pre-existing but undisclosed condition.The duke spent four nights being treated before he was discharged on Christmas Eve morning, in time to join the royal family celebrations at Sandringham.In her message to the country and Commonwealth the Queen mentioned the carol It Came Upon The Midnight Clear - performed at the end of the broadcast.: Sarah Ferguson hails strong and steadfast daughters in wake of Prince Andrew scandalShe added: \"Like many timeless carols, it speaks not just of the coming of Jesus Christ into a ided world, many years ago, but also of the relevance, even today, of the angels message of peace and goodwill.\"Its a timely reminder of what positive things can be achieved when people set aside past dferences and come together in the spirit of friendship and reconciliation.\"And, as we all look forward to the start of a new decade, its worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.\"A string of milestones marked during  were mentioned by the Queen, from the th anniversary of the D-Day landings to the th anniversary of the first moon landing.She began her address by highlighting its theme of \"small steps\" as she spoke about the Apollo  mission.\"As those historic pictures were beamed back to Earth, millions of us sat transfixed to our television screens, as we watched Neil Armstrong taking a small step for man and a giant leap for mankind - and, indeed, for womankind,\" said the Queen.She added: \"Its a reminder for us all that giant leaps often start with small steps.\"Nearby was a picture of the Queen meeting Armstrong and his Apollo  crewmates Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin.Speaking about D-Day, the Queen mentioned the \"look of concern on my fathers face\" as King George VI knew about the secret plans but could not \"share that burden\".Seventy-five years on from the historic landings, she said former enemies had met in friendship at commemorations marking the anniversary in Britain and on the continent.The Queen added: \"Such reconciliation seldom happens overnight. It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.\"Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.\"By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.\"During the broadcast footage was shown of Americas moon landings, national D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, and world leaders meeting the Queen during the recent Nato reception at Buckingham Place, which marked the alliances th anniversary.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were featured at a French D-Day service in Bayeux, Normandy, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were shown celebrating St Patricks Day with the Irish Guards.Speaking about how Jesus showed the world that \"small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences\", the Queen added: \"Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps.\"The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference.\"The Queens comment about experiencing a \"bumpy\" year is thought to be her first public reference to the personal events involving her family during the past  months.During , the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye, and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with a convicted sex offender.The Queen also paid tribute to the men and women of the emergency services and the armed forces, and remembered those on duty this Christmas working to keep the nation \"safe and secure\".At the end of the broadcast footage was shown of the Queen, Charles, William and Prince George preparing Christmas puddings earlier this month at Buckingham Palace for the Royal British Legions Together at Christmas initiative."},{"url":null,"title":"rare-fruiting-lichen-discovered-easter-ross","story":"But, for the first time, a rare ldquofruiting lichen known as Multiclavula corynoides has been discovered in the British Isles ndash growing unassumingly on a gravel road in the Highlands of Scotland.It is not known how long the moss-like plant has been resident north of the Border and it may never have been spotted but for a lucky encounter with a lichen expert working with Scottish Natural Heritage.The find of Multiclavula corynoides ndash sometimes referred to as Club-wielding Crust Lichen ndash was made by David Genney, Scottish Natural Heritagersquos lichen expert, while he was out mountainbiking around Ben Wyvis National Nature Reserve in the Highlands of Scotland.The lichen occurs across Scandinavia, in Iceland and in northern North America but this is the first record of the species in Britain.Most lichens are composed of a cup-fungus and an alga with distinctive circular jam-tart blooms, but this species is dferent because it forms tiny clubshaped ldquofruits which emerge from a mat of algae and fungal threads.It was discovered on the verge of a gravel forest road at the base of Ben Wyvis nature reserve, the slopes of which are home to a huge range of plants, mosses, liverworts and lichens.Mr Genney said: ldquoI was out with a couple of friends enjoying a dayrsquos mountain-biking around Ben Wyvis. While Irsquom usually focused on the trail ahead and wide mountain views I also keep half an eye out for interesting plants and fungi, especially on the long, slow uphill section.ldquoI suppose I was secretly hoping for an excuse for a rest so was delighted when I spotted something a little dferent out of the corner of my eye.The naturalist said he had been inspired to find rare lichens by a project run by Kew gardens in London that aims to seek out unusual and undocumented fungi across the UK.There are an estimated . million species of fungi worldwide ndash and possibly millions more ndash but, because of their often remote habitats, gaining information on their whereabouts can be hard.The Kew Gardens scheme is a five-yearlong effort calling on scientists and the public to rediscover lost species, to look for rare ieties, revisit sites known from historical records for a fresh look, and survey plausible locations for new populations.It was with this in mind that Mr Genney managed to spot the crop of Multiclavula corynoides, despite its remote location.He said: ldquoI recognised it because the Kew Lost and Found Fungi project have been encouraging citizen scientists to look out for rare or under-recorded species.ldquoThey had highlighted a related lichen as one of their target species so things like this were on my radar.ldquoItrsquos always exciting to find something yoursquove never seen but for it to be a species that has never been seen in Britain before made my day.ldquoThe discovery fills a gap in our knowledge of the global distribution of this little fungus. Itrsquos also interesting that it was thriving on an old forestry road siding, demonstrating how nature can sometimes benefit from man-made habitats.ldquoIt just shows the importance of keeping your eyes peeled when yoursquore out and about enjoying the outdoors ndash you never know what you might discover.The discovery may be down to next yearrsquos autumn delivering perfect conditions for fungi to bloom.A damp end to the summer and a wet autumn created fertile ground for them, with some species which usually haunt dark corners being seen in the open.Gardeners at the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens and Partner Gardens have reported findings of unusual species, giant specimens and prolerations of ldquofairy rings made of red and white-spotted toadstools."},{"url":null,"title":"truly-wonderful-times-year","story":"But there was nothing mad about the hiring of Fiona Bruce to front Question Time.

Unfortunately the indications from the EU-Norway talks are that this did not happen and our fishing communities are going to feel the consequences.“Sustainability is important but we must remember that no one has more incentive to ensure sustainable fisheries than family-owned businesses and fishing communities. These groups depend on having reliable stocks now and for future generations.”He continued: “Amongst all the technical discussions and ideological debates, the direct impact on local communities who are reliant on fishing and the surrounding industries is being forgotten. Sustainable fisheries should protect the long-term success of our distinct fishing communities. I hope that the key players in these talks, and our Government, can set aside ideology and reflect on the social impact of quota changes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The name Vale of Scapa will be held in reserve and usedthe council decides in future to replace the third tug as well.A winner has been drawn from the votes for the most popular group of names. Isobel Thompson from Westray has been invited to take part in the naming ceremony for Odin of Scapa and offered the opportunity of a family trip aboard the new tug.Graham Sinclair, chair of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “As names that strongly reflect Orkney’s Norse heritage, these are an excellent choice for the new tugs.“Tugs operated by first class crews play a vital role at the heart of our harbour operations and have helped support the welcome growth in maritime activity we’ve seen in local waters in recent years“I am pleased we are investing in even more capable vessels, which will ensure the continuation of  years of support for the Flotta Terminal and, more recently, the signicant growth in ship to ship work # and allow us to make the most of current and future marine business opportunities, greatly benefiting the economy of the islands.”The design and build contract for the -metre tugs was secured by Sanmar Shipyards of Turkey after a competitive tendering exercise.Construction is taking place at Sanmar’s new specialist tug building facility at Altinova, about an hour south of Istanbul, where work on both tugs is progressing well # as can be seen from the latest photographs taken during a recent inspection by Orkney Marine Services towage staff.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”The government’s failure to fund the ageing inter-island ferry fleet has left Orkney’s most remote and vulnerable communities with an inferior service compared to other areas in Scotland claimed Councillor Stockan.Following a y battle, the council secured £. million in additional government funding for internal ferry services for   — described by Councillor Stockan at the time as the “most signicant financial breakthrough” made by the council in years.The air of positivity failed to last however.OIC say they need £. million to run services in the current financial year — £. million more than the Scottish Government allocation.“This is a burden that most other Scottish councils do not have to bear,” Councillor Stockan continued. “The greater the burden placed on the council to keep the ferries running, the greater the risk of severe cuts to other vital services our community depends upon.“We need a long-term commitment from the government to fully fund the cost of running the service and replacing vessels with modern, cheaper-to-run ferries of a standard you would expect on routes as important as these.”RET was also in Councillor Stockan’s sights.The tarf, which would see cheaper fares for all when travelling across the Pentland Firth, has been mired in legal proceedings with Pentland Ferries making a complaint to the European Commission.From the outset, those at Holyrood said they were committed to see the scheme introduced within the first six months of . However, there appears to be no resolution in sight as we now head into .“It is outrageous that we in Orkney are still waiting for RET and that there appears to be no urgency or political will from the Government to resolve this.“Again, this is a clear case of discrimination against Orkney and our community will find it abominable that the money the government has saved by failing to introduce RET on our routes has been spent where — when it could have been committed to supporting our internal ferry service.“This is why I have written to the First Minister and appealed for her to intervene and ensure that Orkney is treated as fairly as other coastal communities with leline ferry services.”In response, a Scottish Government spokesperson indicated that the government was committed to finding a resolution to the issues raised.The spokesperson said: “At present, Orkney Islands Council are wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.#However, the Scottish Government understands the signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities and we have made clear our commitment to Orkney internal ferry services with the provision of additional revenue funding support totalling £. million in the last two years.“We continue to discuss long term solutions with both Orkney Islands Council and Shetland Islands Council. We established a working group to examine these issues and we are now in receipt of the final report which we are currently considering.”The spokesperson continued: “It is the responsibility of inidual local authorities to manage their own budgets and to allocate the total financial resources available to them, including on ferry services, on the basis of local needs and priorities, having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities.“Ultimately, it is for locally elected representatives to make local decisions on how best to deliver services to their local communities.“Ministers remain committed to pursuing all avenues to deliver RET for Orkney and Shetland, however, the first step is to resolve the complaint that Pentland Ferries have made to the European Commission.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense. Scots are shrewd people and will not buy it.No, I was absent because I was at sea.#with Rees-Mogg hiding below decks I think she was campaigning in the SW of England.Not surprising. The Brexit party are all at sea.At least you were at sea doing an honest days work Robert, unlike the other candidates. Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled. I read tonight that Jo Swinson has apologised that she and her Lib Dems backed the Tories# austerity policies. But last night I saw Willie Rennie backing those policies to the hilt. What a party.Jo was talking about the past.Willie was thinking about the future.Now  have quit, including Rees Mogg. Like what Robert did there though, referring to Jacob#s sister, formerly of the Brexit Party, and no longer campaigning for them in the South East of England. You#ve got to ask how a spare bedroom tax would impact on that family# including in their second and third homes and any additional properties in their portfolios.WHY SOCIALIST SNP MEMBERS SHOULD VOTE LABOUR TOMORROW:For the first time in forty years and possibly for the last time during my le, we have the chance to support a manesto that includes widespread nationalisation and the restoration of worker’s rights.These are policies that any self-respecting socialist would have regarded as red lines before Thatcher came along and “modernised” British politics.After Brexit and Scottish independence, we willto the natural battle between left and right. It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.When Boris replies to the letter requesting an independence referendum for Shetland, I hope the recipient will share it on this forum.We could all do with a laugh.Don#t make us laugh IanI wouldn#t trust this council to run a bath never mind having full autonomy of all the finances!Are you going to be King Ian Just a jest, George, but many a true word!If Sturgeon goes Indy I would rather stay with the UK or go for autonomy. . Think about it.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited. Some wonderful handwringing from Carmichael on Viking Energy this election.Well done for your stand there and on UHA.Particularly pleasing to see Friends of the Earth saying Labour#s manesto was better for the environment than that of the Greens.O dear, poor Peter.On the wrong side again.#Labour#s worst performance since #. #Corbin’s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members.# What the Socialist left did for Labour, just imagine what the would do to the UK and shudder!!! Momentumare the new Militant Tendency, no wonder they are heading to the dust bin of history.No, I am agreeing with you Malcolm, and also saying there is a conversation to be had locally about how long Shetland should continue to host the oil industry.The biggest benefit would have been in stable local employment, but that is not what we have seen.If the oil industry honours its original promises there will be years of work in ing the terminal site to nature.Some will say the sooner that begins the better.If that thinking can#t happen on the left where  will it happen Apparently % voted for political parties that wanted a second Brexit referendum, but now we#ve got the blues.What hope now for the  in  bairns born into poverty Thank goodness we avoided Corbyn#s, Socialism Peter. Look to Socialism in Venasuallia what that would do for us. That whole country is in poverty.Over  million scots voted to remain in the uk nowhere near that amount of scots voted to remain in the eu or for the snp. What is it about democracy you don#t understand  You seem to think you just change the question to suit the answer you claim to have got to a question that was never asked.

An exit poll at pm yesterday predicting a possible SNP gain from the Liberal Democrats ultimately proved to be wrong, with a comfortable majority of , for Mr Carmichael in the end.It was Mr Carmichael#s sixth win in the Northern Isles. He has been the MP for the seat since .The Lib Dem used his acceptance speech first to thank the ing officers, the other candidates for a #spirited and good-natured campaign#, his own campaign team, and we and family, who had been #staunch in their support#.He went on to say that representing the people of Orkney and Shetland had been, and remained, his #greatest privilege#.It was more of a #mixed picture#, as Mr Carmichael said prior to his election result announcement, for the Lib Dems across the board.The party were unable to capitalise on their strong anti-Brexit message in this election, making a net loss of one seat across the UK. They now have  MPs.This included a shock scalp in the form of party leader Jo Swinson, who lost her Dunbartonshire seat earlier in the night to the SNP.Despite being pipped to the post in this constituency, it was the SNP who made big gains across Scotland, taking  more seats. The party#s performance prompted their candidate Mr Leslie to say that a second Scottish independence referendum is something that #seriously# needs looking at.However, that may prove dficult given an incoming government who have said they will refuse to grant one.Boris Johnson has the keys to Number  after securing a majority government for the Conservatives. Targeting leave-voting Labour areas seems to have paid off for the Prime Minister.Labour lost  seats on the night, prompting leader Jeremy Corbyn to announce that he intends to stand down.Their candidate Coilla Drake called it a #sad, sad day#.Mr Carmichael also used his acceptance speech to criticise Mr Johnson and his incoming government.#The next five years is going to be a dficult and dangerous for this, our United Kingdom,# he said.The newly re-elected MP, however, ended on an almost hopeful note, focusing on the need for #liberal voices#, unity and solidarity, which he said was #greater than ever before#.The turnout for the Orkney and Shetland election was just under  per cent, with , Northern Isles folk voting. raquoSo , how did the Remain parties# anti-Brexit policies work out for them  Ten years of Tory government, as a direct result.

As a Swede I feel a strong fellowship. Hope the outcomewon#t tarnish it.No Brian, the SNP only say they want to Remain, as a stick to beat Westminster with.Their defining policy, independence, was guaranteed to take us out of the EU # with #No Deal# # on independence Day. The EU has confirmed this #repeatedly#.They also know they would be unable to rejoin until we satisfy the EU#s onerous conditions, notably:. Austerity to cut necessary borrowing within EU Stability and Growth Pact guidelines. .Establish our own central bank and currency # this will take nine years .. Hand the EU control of our economy and trade, agriculture and fisheries.Throw in control ofenergy and our military and Scots will never vote for it. They know that, too. So expect a policy switch, replacing EU membership with EFTA. . It follows that they are only demanding Indyref  because they #ken fine weel# it won#t be allowed and will use that to stoke phoney grievance against Westminster, with the added advantageof it being over before we find out what kind of trade deals Westminster achieves with the EU, US, etc.Goodness, so the SNP did so well because they are aLeave Party!No, Brian. The SNP did not do well #because they are a secret Leave party# . They did well because of the absence of credible opposition, notably, from the Labour Party, with its incompetent leadership both nationally and in Scotland. Labour has gone from being the predominant Scottish party for decades to fourth position, behind the LibDems, with a single MP who stated in his election speech that #Labour must change or die.#Labour#s demise was well under way, long before Brexit arrived on the scene.So why did ex-Labour voters in Scotland vote for a secret Leave Party while ex-Labour voters in England voted for an up-front Leave Party!My grievance with Westminster is not #phoney#.Why don#t you tell us, Brian After all, you are one of the ones who deserted Labour, jumping ship to the SNP.The reasons for Labour#s demise in Scotland were not much to do with Brexit. It was well under way, long before Brexit. So back to my original point.

In response to Ofgem’s decision, SSEN is also promising to progress preparation of the Shetland #standby arrangements# which will complement the transmission link.It is hoped the decision will provide Shetland’s renewable developers clarity about future network charges, helping them make investment decisions and provide the evidence required by Ofgem for the regulator to approve the proposed transmission link to the Shetland Isles. Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.“The proposal will support future security of supply as well as unlocking Shetland’s renewable potential.Once built, the transmission link and the low carbon output from renewable generators on Shetland will also help support the electricity needs of Shetland’s oil and gas industry and its wider economy.“Our transmission business will shortly re-submit to Ofgem an updated Needs Case for the Shetland link and we look forward to working with Ofgem and Shetland developers to progress this proposal in a timely manner.”Funny how things like this are announced during the few days between the General Election and Christmas.Last we heard was renewable energy developers crying their eyes out that the proposed MW cable was inadequate for all the wind farms they want to build on Shetland.#Follow the money#. So-called #contributions# from SSEN#s customers and bigger cables with more generation lead to a reduction in the price of VE#s next bid in a renewable energy auction.Who would bet against SSEN#s revised #final needs case# proposing an even bigger capacity cable, enabling even more and bigger wind farms to be built Commenting on today’s decision, Colin Nicol, Managing Director for Networks, said: “We welcome today’s decision by Ofgem to approve our whole system solution for Shetland, which is a positive step toward meeting Shetland’s electricity needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers than alternative options.Does this statement mean that the average shetland family would be able to obtain electricity cheaper on the commissioning of the project  Would it be possiblethe turbines were commissioned prior to the connector cable being commissioned then could the power be made available locally at reduced pricing  This looks like so much greenwash and so many weasel words to a community whose council has a vested interest in rolling over and playing dead. What exactly are we to read into #meeting Shetland#s energy needs at a much lower cost to energy consumers# There is an implied promise there, and even a threat, but no actual guarantee of cheaper bills for local residents.As for #unlocking Shetland#s renewable potential#, this looks like code for unlocking their potential to exploit the landscape and the people through environmentally harmful proposals the people will get no say in.Shetland remains in thrall to the notion that all potential economic activity is necessarily a positive development.Some developments however represent an approach to development that dlsempowers, robs folk of a say and foists solutions onto them that do not address their problems or needs.There will be opportunities for some to profit no doubt, but is is hard for the council to dispassionately manage partnership with these far larger players when they are so wowed by the prospect of cash flowing into the reserves through ground rent to the Busta estate.The SIC will do diddlysquat to ensure local concerns are considered.I do wonder what those who think wind energy is the green way forward for Shetland think about the irony of it being used to power more fossil fuel production .."},{"url":null,"title":"development officer at shetland tourism association 2 ","story":"A unique opportunity to work with and support tourism businesses throughout Shetland.The STA is seeking a motivated inidual with a passion for tourism for a fixed term  year post.The postholder will work  hours per week on a self-employed basis.Tasks will include website updates, liaising with members and industry bodies, arranging member events, overseeing the implementation of the Tourism Strategy and producing reports as required."},{"url":null,"title":"hjaltland housing association ","story":"HAS AVAILABLE TO REGISTERED APPLICANTSpayable £. p.c.m.

Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family.“Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies skyrocket by % in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts.

The Colin area representative has replaced newly elected MP for North Belfast John Finucane.Co-opted to Belfast City Council in Janaury , the -year-old told the Andersonstown News that it will be a “huge honour” to represent the people of Belfast.“What can I say, it’s amazing,” he said. “I’m honoured to have been asked by Sinn Féin to be the next Ard Mhéara of Belfast. “I have been an activist in the Colin area since I was . I’m very much about grassroots politics and that theme is something I want to continue. “I want to use the office of Mayor to bring politics from the ground up.” Having topped the council election poll in May, Danny spoke of how he will be continuing the civic work of party colleague John Finucane. “The role of Mayor is city-wide, I want to be a Mayor for all communities and to represent everybody. I want to champion the need for improvements to our mental health services. It’s something that has really impacted the Colin area. I want to use the office of Mayor to help in whatever way I can. I will work with our young people to ensure that they are included in decision-making that they have a brighter future and better quality of le.”The Lagmore father-of-three said he will be straight into Mayor business when he takes over the ‘chain’ today.“I want to do this for my family.  has been a dficult year for our family with the loss of our mother Edna.

I want to pay tribute to outgoing Ard Mhéara John Finucane.

We have had ‘sympathy’ from the UK Government through the Secretary of State, from all political parties that stood on our picket lines and from the leadership of the health service. But we have no resolution.“UNISON has agreed emergency cover and our members have volunteered to provide it. We have never seen such determination in health workers who have been devalued and disrespected for almost  years. For  weeks they have stood up for their rights and have now put the health service at the top of the political agenda.“Despite their sacrice there is still no action from those in power. It would appear that health workers, patients and the public at large are being used as pawns in a political game.“As we enter this signicant period in the industrial struggle the consequences lay firmly on the shoulders of the UK Government, our elected politicians and the leadership of the civil service.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"welcome organisation be kind to those living on the street","story":"I meet with Welcome Organisation CEO Sandra Moore in a room stacked from floor to almost ceiling of sleeping bags, which I’m told, have been donated by the Marine Society and Sea Cadets. Most,not all, of these will be gone over the coming nights to those sleeping rough in the city centre. Offering tea and coffee on tap from am until pm at their Townsend Street HQ, Sandra told the Andersonstown News that the need for their service is very much “ days a year”. “We have service users coming to us with ious needs, whether it’s clothes, a cup of tea or somewhere to have a bit of refuge. We do make targeted appeals throughout the year via our Facebook page and we do have people ringing to ask is there anything in particular we need. We always need decent trainers, sturdy, durable. We can’t hold out to jeans, in smaller sizes of waist, new underwear on which there is a massive demand all year round, socks and toiletries. “We can’t hold out to coffee, tea, sugar, washing powder, toilet roll, those things make a big dference to us,” she said.“We would ask for those who are donating that there is a reasonable le left in the items they want to give. We always have a need for sleeping bags and we don’t distribute tents on the streets as they would pose a danger.”Established  years ago, the Welcome Organisation has provided a vital shelter for those sleeping rough and who are experiencing homelessness. Sandra spoke of how the need for the service has “changed dramatically” in that time.“We are dealing with a greater number of people, people with more signicant issues, drug, alcohol, mental health, not all the people we work with do, its some, not all. What we are finding is that the age profile of those seeking the service is much younger, and there are more women coming to the Organisation. When I came  years ago we had six women in service. Now a third of our service users are female.”She continued: “We are working with homelessness in its most chronic form. We can’t forget that there is hidden homelessness. By that I mean people sleeping on sofas, moving from pillar to post. Nobody has a handle on that. One in  people within their le in Northern Ireland will experience homelessness. Le expectancy of someone who has had periods of continuous homelessness is  for a woman and  for a man.”Sandra said that currently those service users at the centre are predominantly young males from North and West Belfast.As  comes to a close, Sandra said that the issue of homelessness is facing a constant struggle in the New Year.“All services are facing pressure, lack of mental health services, lack of drug and alcohol support service and not just in Belfast, right across the North. We do not have detox or rehab facilities here, what services are there, due to severe pressures, aren’t responsive enough. We are trying to bridge that gap. It’s quite evident right across the city that there is a growing drug problem, there is a real need for education in communities. “People have to bear in mind that there is a back story to each and every person who is homeless. This is someone’s son, somebody’s daughter. Nobody has ever set out on that path. What child do you ask and they say ‘I want to be ill’, ‘I want to be struggling with addiction’, ‘I want to be homeless’. It’s not an aspiration but unfortunately it’s were we are. In Belfast I think we have a chance to not end up like Dublin, like London, the big cities. We still have a chance of doing something to contain it, but the agencies need to work together.”“No-one knows what the budget is for Ireland next year. How can you possibly plan while we have no minister for finance or minster for health  We, along with others, are highly dependent on the good will of the public, we couldn’t survive without the public,” she said. “I’ve been here  years and every year I am still overwhelmed by the generosity of people, people are very kind, however homelessness is an issue  days of the year.”Sandra said the levels of increased poverty within households job losses and the impact of Universal Credit are contributing factors to homelessness. “Regardless of whatever way Brexit goes, the economy is shrinking again, there is higher unemployment. “As my grandmother always said ‘when poverty comes in the door, love goes out the window’. We see so many times relationships breaking down because of the stresses of poverty linked to job losses. Statistics show that children growing up in poverty that their le chances are much worse. Someone who experiences homelessness as a child is much more likely to experience it as an adult – we need more preventive services going forward.”With the Organisation’s core team of staff, Sandra said that they couldn’t provide their service without their “ volunteers”. “We had  for Christmas dinner last year and so far we have wrapped over  Christmas presents,  of those bespoke for our regular users. We are inundated with people wanting to volunteer with us on Christmas Day – it’s a lovely day but it’s a hard day for a lot of people as you can imagine. We try to keep familiar faces around for the people that are coming in.“We just want to thank everyone for their continued support, we couldn’t do our work without it. We have a fantastic team of staff, of volunteers and the support of the public and the community. All I would ask is that people continue to be kind. That’s all I ask, is for people to be kind to those on the street. We don’t always know the story of how or why it has come to that.”For more information on the Welcome Organisation or to donate visit www.homelessbelfast.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"young people saying yes to yeha project","story":"ESTABLISHED over ten years ago, the YEHA Project has gone from strength to strength in helping young people in North Belfast.Based in the Flax Centre and the Houben Centre in Ardoyne, YEHA stands for Youth, Education, Health and Advice.The YEHA Project is made up of a small dedicated team of five full-time staff, sessional workers and a team of volunteers. One such youth worker is -year-old Cara O’Kane, who has been involved with YEHA Project for four years.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Cara explained more about the work of YEHA Project.“The YEHA Project supports young people in North Belfast aged  to  to tackle issues affecting their health and emotional well being,” she said.“Our work with young people embraces the core principles of youth work with therapeutic approaches.“Basically, we were set up over ten years ago to tackle health inequalities in North Belfast.“Our focus is on trying to get young people to focus on healthy lestyles and make positive and healthy choices regarding their wellbeing.“We do a lot of mentoring and support work where a young person would work with a youth worker informally centered around mental health and wellbeing. This may involve building coping skills and strategies for any dficulties they are facing in their le and looking at their interests and skills.“We want young people more involved in the community and activities instead of just going home after school as well.“It is about getting them out and about and giving them opportunities to try dferent things“We have had fantastic feedback from the young people themselves about the work that we do. They are testament to the work that they do themselves with our projects.“Our projects are all voluntary and everything is in the young person’s hands. Sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but the benefits are massive.The YEHA Project is also involved with cross-community work, alongside an organisation based on the Woodvale called Streetbeat Youth Project.Another successful project is the Carezone in Schools project, a pilot programme which is currently into its second year, based at Mercy College.Cara explained: “It is a model where we run one-to-one support within the school and have someone from YEHA project in the school daily to work with students in school.“After running a research programme, we found that over  per cent of young people would be more likely to speak to another young person about their problems rather than an adult.“We run the one-to-one mentoring service alongside a Peer Mentor programme where young people are trained up in Peer Mentoring to help support other young people on issues affecting their mental health and enables them to signpost to relevant support agencies.“It was a successful first year and last year we delivered  sessions to  pupils covering a range of issues including building coping skills and resilience, relationships, communication and social skills, health and well-being and anxiety.“We have a nice room in Mercy College where young people can come and relax and they are more likely to open up in such an environment.“It is all voluntary too, of course.”One young person, who took part in the programme, Jodie Shevlin, praised the benefits of it during the pressures of school exams.“The Carezone in Schools project is a way for pupils to distress and escape from the pressure of school work and exam,” she said.“The one-to-one work the project does is a chance for us to get worries or problems off our chest and be able to just have a more relaxed chat where we are really listened to.“It has really helped me get through my last few years of school.”YEHA ProjectFlax CentreArdoyne AvenueBelfast BT DATel:    "},{"url":null,"title":"derry girl jessica craig 9 steps out to give abandoned dogs a truly","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The dficulty is the greys carry squirrel pox virus, a nasty virus that kills reds within  days, while the greys are immune.\"The question is can reds and greys live together with a level of harmony  And the answer is no, they cant. If we do nothing, the greys will kill all the reds, its absolutely inevitable that will happen.\"The population of red squirrels continues to drop dramatically - there used to be .m reds in Britain and Ireland, and that population has dropped to just , since the introduction of greys in the th century.Mr Martin added: \"This small area of Ards and North Down is absolutely mission critical to the survival of reds in Northern Ireland. What can we do  We have to control the greys. What Ive asked for is a report - I think officers can work with Ulster Wildle, and in particular the North Down Squirrel and Pine Marten Group, to see what can be put in place to protect our red squirrels.\"We can for example grant Ulster Wildle access to council properties to control greys, and when we use the word control, we do mean to kill.\"I know that doesnt sit well with some environmentalists, depending on what side of the argument youre on. Some people I know and respect will not kill any creatures, but the key argument here is we cannot box greys away.\"Alliance representative Andrew Muir asked for an amendment including the phrase the potential positive and negative impacts of permitting grey squirrel culling on council land.But Mr Martin said the amendment was \"too woolly\" and insisted he was not asking for a cull.Green councillor Kathryn McNickle, who supported the amendment, said: \"It is a dficult and emotive issue. I dont want to see any culling of animals, I dont think anyone around the table does, but we also need to balance that with protecting our native ecosystem.\"There has been signicant research that suggests control of grey squirrels is necessary.\"The amendment to the original motion failed to pass as it had six votes for and six against.

The Conservatives spent almost £m, including over £, in the last week of campaigning. And £, was spent on Prime Minister Boris Johnsons Facebook page.The figures are recorded on Facebooks Ad Library and indicate total spend by iniduals and parties as well as the price band on inidual posts. For example, many advertisements are listed as having a spend of under £, or between £ and £.Alliance spent the most on advertising on social media. It paid £, for political adverts with just under half spent in the last week of the campaign. It ran  ads between December  and  and most featured either leader Naomi Long or deputy leader Stephen Farry. Mr Farry was elected as MP for North Down.As well as covering policy such as health, economy, animal welfare, climate change and welfare cuts, many of the ads included polling figures on the East Belfast and North Down constituencies and how close the projections were.It spent between £ and £ on an ad for Mr Farry dealing with loyalist \"fake news\" posters which appeared around North Down and other areas linking the party to nationalism and the IRA.\"Just some of the nonsense weve seen over the last few weeks. Dont let loyalist trolls and their fake news tell you how to vote,\" the post, which was accompanied by some of the offending material, said.Its most effective ad emphasised how Northern Ireland was home to \"thriving business\" and how Brexit would place \"barriers\" to trade.

The social media giant was put under pressure to ban political ads. It established a special operations centre to combat abuse and stop the spread of misinformation and urged users to flag any problematic posts.And in the run-up to the election there were reports of posts disappearing from the Ad Library. Facebook said it would investigate.Twitter banned all forms of political advertising ahead of the election on its .When an advertiser categorises its ad as about political matters it must disclose who paid for it under Facebook rules.

Two of its candidates did, however. Almost £ was spent on leader Steve Aikens page in his ultimately unsuccessful challenge to the DUPs Sammy Wilson in East Antrim.And £, was spent on South Antrim candidate Danny Kinahans campaign in his bid to reclaim his seat from the DUP.Paul Girvan held the seat.The DUP were the next big spenders of the parties on the social media s locally. The party spent £, on  advertisements from October up to the election. In the final week of the election £, was spent. In North Belfast Nigel Dodds bid to hold the seat was the focus of its online campaign in the final weeks. An ad featuring Mr Dodds at the party launch of the manesto emphasising how it had delivered for Northern Ireland and its \"positive plan for the future\", was its biggest spend.The party spent at most £ on two dferent versions of the ad. The  second clip was featured on at least , Facebook profiles. It appears to have been targeted at men and mostly those under .The SDLP spent £, - third on the list of local parties. Separately £, was spent on leader Colum Eastwood and Claire Hannas pages.The party took out four ads in December. Three were for Michael Savages campaign in South Down, where Sinn Feins Chris Hazzard was re-elected, and one for Colum Eastwood, who won back the Foyle seat. The Eastwood ad appears to have been targeted at women, particularly those aged over .Sinn Fein spent the least. It has the biggest following of all the local parties with ,, dwarfing the DUPs ,, the next biggest following. Alliance has , followers.According to the Facebook data, the party spent no money on ads in the UK in December and November. However, in Ireland it spent just over €, from March up to December .It ran five ads in December. Two featured ed Fermanagh-South Tyrone candidate Michelle Gildernew, who was elected, and three for defeated Foyle candidate Elisha McCallion. As Facebook only gives ranges of money paid, it can only be estimated the party spent a maximum of €, on ads specically for the Westminster election.The most amount of money in December was spent on an ad for Ms McCallion. Between € and € was spent on an ad which featured a simple photo montage on the partys influence around the world.The page for new North Belfast MP John Finucane has a following of , - bigger than that of the SDLP and UUP.

But it was kind of half serious, half joking in a way.“But all messing aside, I do think at the very least a high-level engineering assessment should be done as to whether it is a viable proposal.”Other parties have been less enthusiastic about the idea, with Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken saying investment was urgently needed in Northern Ireland’s infrastructure first.Mr Varadkar said: “I know people dismiss these things out of hand, but they used to dismiss the Channel Tunnel as well – the idea of building a tunnel between France and Britain – and I know what I see when I see a bridge tunnel between Denmark and Sweden, when you fly over New Orleans and you see  miles of bridge, it’s extraordinary,” he said.“I think we need to at least check out is this viable in engineering terms and how much money it would cost to do.”There are actually loads of really good projects we could do together that might not cost as much and would definitely be more feasible than a bridge between Scotland and Northern IrelandLeo VaradkarHowever Mr Varadkar said he is more interested in talking to Mr Johnson about other projects the two nations could work on together, such as a high-speed rail link connecting Dublin, Belfast and Cork, and better connections to the north west.He suggested hourly trains between the cities as well as improving the A road to Londonderry and Donegal.Mr Varadkar said he was also interested in the idea of a cross-border university, involving the Ulster University campus at Magee in Derry with Letterkenny IT, as well as the greenway projects and the Ulster Canal.“There are actually loads of really good projects we could do together that might not cost as much and would definitely be more feasible than a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland,” he said.“But in my pursuit of those ones I’m not going to dismiss the one that the Prime Minister’s particularly keen on.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/62958/38812320.ece/BINARY/cdb003.jpg","title":"welcome to the world northern irelands 2019","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I felt so free. I can’t wait to do it againChristopher SloanThe team at the centre then invited both brothers to try an indoor skying session.After his second go, Christopher said he was already looking forward to trying it again.“It was amazing. I felt so free. I can’t wait to do it again,” he said.His brother David sported a superman costume for his turn, saying: “It was the best experience I’ve had, apart from my kids being born.”Christopher preparesPeter Sloan said it had been incredible to watch.“It was incredible to watch him in action and see the pure excitement and joy that being weightless and flying brought to him,” he said.“He wanted to come back and his brother David also wanted to try it, so we are so grateful to the team at We Are Vertigo for their kindness in inviting us back – it’s given us all a big lt.“The team were so good with them both. It’s important that there be no limits when you have disabilities – there’s enough obstacles out there stopping us.“The instructors and staff made us feel like there was nothing Christopher and David couldn’t do.“It’s amazing to have facilities like this in Belfast, that help people like Christopher and David. It provides a really important release, gets them out of the house and helps improve their mental health as well.”We were so inspired when we saw Christopher taking flight – he is living proof that there are no limits to what you can achieve when you put your mind to somethingGareth MurphyWe Are Vertigo managing director Gareth Murphy described the brothers as inspiring.“We were so inspired when we saw Christopher taking flight – he is living proof that there are no limits to what you can achieve when you put your mind to something,” he said.“We were so touched by the positive and uplting impact that the experience had for Christopher and his family, and when we heard that his brother David also wanted to have a go, we had to invite them back to experience the thrill of indoor skying together.“Maeve, one of our instructors, was there during Christopher’s first flight and was blown away by how quickly he followed the instructions and achieved independent flight, far surpassing the heights reached by many people on their first go. “She was so inspired by his story that when we told her we were bringing Christopher and his brother back, she came into work on her day off to see them fly again.“Seeing the joy and freedom they experienced was just incredible and instilled a great sense of pride amongst our entire team that we were able to play a part in helping them to achieve their dreams.“We’ve given Christopher and David an open invitation toand use our facilities any time they want and we look forward to sharing many more flights with them in the future.”"},{"url":null,"title":"green taoiseach possible in two governments time insists eamon ryan","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

How dare you’.“I do think we represent them and I think having young candidates who are who are kind of in tune with that….I think that’s fair enough for us because that’s the people we’re representing and therefore it makes sense to have similar candidates that can express their view,” he said.“I think we could get more andwe did so, we would have a stronger hand in in negotiations after the next election.“So I would say it is better to over perform rather than kind of be presumptuous, and ultimately it’s up to the electorate –  they have to decide who’s going to represent them.”With sincerest thanks to everyone who has supported us this year, we would like to pass on our very best wishes for a peaceful and happy Christmas.Beannachtaí an tSéasúir, from all at the Green Party. ���� pic jlnvzFci— Green Party IrelandDecember , “We’re running in every constituency in the Dail  elections and I think we have a chance in a whole load of them so we might surprise people by doing more than that.”Mr Ryan defended accusations his party will fail toTDs in rural areas due to some of their policies.“If we’re going to address the bioersity and climate crisis we face well then every place matters, particularly rural Ireland.“And it is not an agenda, going Green is going to be good for rural Ireland and it will be better for farming as the current system is not working.“It is not paying farmers properly, there’s no young farmers going into farming.“I will be better for forestry as there will be much more natural forests that are full of wildle.”“There will be better balanced development  – not just everything tilted towards the east coast as we need to develop our towns and villages and cities, outside Dublin.“So I think we’re going to turn that narrative. We have already seen it in the local and European elections.“We did really well right across the country and I think we have a chance in the election of winning in places where we’ve never been seen to have a chance before.”Mr Ryan criticised Minister for Rural Affairs Michael Ring and the Government for directing money to new road projects instead of public transport in rural areas.“All of the money is going on motorways.“Just last week we seen that they are going to be widening the N – that will be  million euro.“There will be no traffic gain because it is just heading to a gridlock in Dublin.”“Michael Ring is trumpeting – ‘oh, I’e got a quarter of a billion to widen the road from Castlebar to Westport’.“What would a quarter of a billion euro have delivered for public transport  before we have a billion deliver for public transport in Mayoyou were to switch it to that.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Ryan criticised the Government for directing money into new roads instead of public transport in rural areas “And that is in a Westport where people are standing all the way from Dublin on the  train – like it’s crazy what they’re doing.”“I think Irish people are waking up.“They’re just building roads everywhere just doesn’t work – it just doesn’t work for motorists because you just get more cars and more gridlock.

Evidence suggests some were brought from more than a  miles away.Dr Richard Madgwick of Cardf University led the study, supported by researchers from Queens University, Memorial University Newfoundland and the British Geological Survey.Dr Madgwick said: \"Our results provide clear evidence that communities in Iron Age Ireland were very mobile and that livestock were also moved over greater distances than was previously thought.\"The high proportion of pig remains found there is very rare for this period. This suggests that Navan Fort was a feasting centre, as pigs are well-suited as feasting animals and in early Irish literature pork is the preferred food of the feast.\"It is clear that Navan Fort had a vast catchment and that the influence of the site was far-reaching.\"Researchers used multi-isotope analysis on samples of tooth enamel to unlock the origins of each animal. Food and water have chemical compositions linked to the geographical areas where they are sourced. When animals eat and drink, these chemical signals are archived in their teeth, allowing scientists to investigate the location where they were raised.Dr Finbar McCormick from Queens University, who co-authored the research, said: \"In the absence of human remains, multi-isotope analysis of animals found at Navan Fort provides us with the best indication of human movement at that time.\"Feasting, almost iniably associated with sacrice, was a social necessity of early societies where the slaughter of a large domesticate necessitated the consumption of a large amount of meat in a short period of time.\"Earlier this year Dr Madgwicks research of  pigs found at sites near Stonehenge revealed animals came from as far away as Scotland and numerous other locations across the British Isles.Before this, the origins of people who visited this area and the extent of the populations movements at the time had been long-standing enigmas in British pre-history.Dr Madgwick added: \"Transporting animals across the country would have involved a great deal of time and effort so our findings demonstrate the important role they played in society.\"Food was clearly a central part of peoples exchanges and traditions.\""},{"url":null,"title":"chimps predisposed to music and like to boogie study shows","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Science ReporterDecember   : AM CommentsChimps predisposed to music and like to boogie, study showsBelfastChimpanzees have a sense of rhythm and like to move to the beat, according to a new study.https:www.belfasttelegraph news viral chimps-predisposed-to-music-and-like-to-boogie-study-shows-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph news viral f .ece AUTOCROP h bpanews_feb-ea-f-d-aabb_EmailChimpanzees have a sense of rhythm and like to move to the beat, according to a new study..pushScientists have found that listening to music prompts the primates to perform rhythmic movements such as swaying, hand-clapping and foot-tapping.The researchers say that understanding more about the predisposition of these great apes to music could shed light on how humans came to appreciate melodies.Dr Yuko Hattori and professor Masaki Tomonaga, of Kyoto University in Japan, studied seven chimpanzees who were exposed to six two-minute piano compositions for six days.They found that while the music was being played, the chimps swayed their bodies and bobbed their heads and, sometimes, went as far as clapping their hands and tapping their feet.The team also found that male chimpanzees were more likely to respond to the tunes by being more vocal and swaying rhythmically for longer durations compared with their female counterparts.In their paper, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , the researchers noted: “Given that humans do not have such a sex dference in musical ability, higher sensitivity to sound in male chimpanzees may have been acquired after chimpanzees erged from the common ancestor shared with humans.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A male chimpanzee making a rhythmic display at the enclosure in the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University “This may also be associated with their patriarchal society, where male chimpanzees often collaborate to protect their territory and group members.”To understand more about their musical inclination, the researchers selected the chimpanzee most responsive to the music.They then exposed the animal, called Akira, to additional musical sessions, with four two-minute experiences for  days.The researchers found that both random and regular beats induced rhythmic swaying in Akira.The movements were more pronounced when Akira was standing on two feet rather than on all fours, which the researchers believe could be down to the chimpanzee having a greater flexibility in the bipedal posture.In addition, Akira also stayed longer in the area where music was playing, indicating that the chimpanzee actively sought musical stimulation.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The chimpanzee enclosure at the Primate Research Institute, Kyoto University According to the authors, the findings point to a foundation for dancing in a common ancestor of chimpanzees and humans.The team wrote in the paper: “In humans, listening to music induces rhythmic movement, suggesting a close connection between the auditory and motor areas in the brain.“These results suggest that prerequisites for music and dance are deeply rooted and existed in the common ancestor shared by humans and chimpanzees, approximately six million years ago.”Meanwhile, in a separate study also published in Pnas, scientists have found that chimpanzees share tools with each other and teach their fellow beings new skills so they are able to perform complex and challenging food-hunting tasks.Researchers in the US say that this act of sharing tools and skills in chimpanzees is similar to that seen in humans."},{"url":null,"title":"monkeys enjoy specially baked mince pies ahead of christmas at london zoo","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The X Box, the Playstation and Nintendo Wii offer an almost limitless choice of gaming s to enjoy inter-connectivity in a high definition world of colour. However,  years ago in , the new world of home video game consoles was a new monochrome phenomenon. The first company to launch a home video game console was the Calornia based form Atari. Founded in , the firm initially concentrated on designing arcade games. But as the decade progressed it became clear that the huge appetite for computer-based games was readily transferrable to the home. googletag.cmd.push By , one of Atari’s founders Nolan Bushell employed an engineering company that constructed a console capable of playing the original games designed by the pioneering firm for arcades. The result was the Atari Video Computer System . Released in September , the VCS was priced at the hefty sum of around pound – the equivalent of approximately pound today. The first incarnation of the system included a console, two joysticks, a pair of paddles and the Combat game cartridge. There were however eight other games available to be sold separately that included – Air-Sea Battle, Star Ship and Street Racer and Breakout. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most memorable of all the games of this era was Pong- the two-dimensional table tennis simulator. The game, originally developed as a training exercise in programming for an Atari employee, was one of the earliest arcade video games back in  and proved hugely commercially successful. A separate home version that could be played on a TV was released in . Players controlled game paddles by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. The aim was to win by amassing eleven points. A point was won when one failed tothe ball to the other. The game was then included in the games for the Atari VCS two years later. Despite the obvious huge advances in gaming technology in the ensuing four decades the enduring appeal of Atari for people of a certain age remains. The Atari Flashback with the original games can still be bought today for around pound. But what other toys enthralled the children of the s  Launched in , the Nerf Ball was billed as the “world’s first official indoor ball”. The marketing team charged with selling what was essentially a large foam sphere, emphasised the safety aspect of the product by stating: “You can’t damage lamps or break windows. You can’t hurt babies or old people.” This simple message was very effective because four million Nerf Balls were sold in it’s first year in existence. Undoubtedly another of the favourite and best toys of the era was the Evel Knievel Stunt Cycle. Ideal Toys launched its popular line of toy bikes in  and zoned in on the antics of the crazy American stuntman to boost their sales. Knievel made a total of  jumps on his Harley Davidson that year including a leap over  vans at the start of that year. Whilst Evel is probably best remembered for his spectacular crashes rather than his successes, the sales of the toy did not crash and sold in millions. One of the few toys that made a full-blownto the commercial market  years after its original launch was Stretch Armstrong. Introduced to the world by the Kenner toy company in  the muscular male figure made of laytex rubber and filled with gelled corn syrup allows it to be stretched from its original size of  inches up to around  foot before reverting back to its normal shape. If a tear developed it could be repaired with an adhesive bandage and instructions on how to fix Stretch were included inside the box. Hasbro who bought the brand, very successfully brought Stretch Armstrong back to the market at the New York Toy Fair in . Christmas of course sees us all indulge in sweets and the s was no exception. Cadbury’s honed in on a novel way of enticing children to want their products even more. The Dairy Milk dispenser spat out inidual squares of the world-famous confectionary for the princely sum of p. The mini machines were replenished by refill packs sold at stores such as the now long gone Woolworth’s chain. The dispenser was also marketed on the basis that it had an added attraction of doubling up as a money box. But it’s suspectedthat after a while the chocolate refill packs were consumed without ever having seen the inside of the dispenser with the ‘saved’ two-pence pieces retrieved and spent quickly on something . First to three goals was the aim in the table top game Crossfire in the s. The object was to push one of the pucks through the opposing player’s goal by firing small metal ball bearings at them using the attached guns. The effect of the Star Wars film series on popular culture has been immense. But with the filmmakers initially dubious about the success of the first film in , manufacturers were seemingly reluctant to launch a toy franchise based on the film. As a result, Star Wars toys were slow to hit the shelves  years ago. When they did, the Kenner company found the demand was enormous and to begin with launched four figures. They expanded the range in  and effectively became a license to print money. But still demand often exceeded supply and the range was often hard to come by. As filming began for The Empire Strikes Back in spring  children were screaming for new merchandise that Christmas. And nothing has changed since. All that’s left to ponder about this range is the fate of the executive of the American toy company Mego who took the decision to turn down the chance to manufacture the Star Wars toy range. The firm established in , specialised in making toy figures and promptly folded in . If you want to buy an original s Girl’s Word made by Palitoy in good condition, it’ll cost you around pound on vintage toy sellers website. The original cost was pound – roughly the equivalent of what a vintage version will cost you now. Launched in the mid-s Girl’s World was a brunette or blonde model hair and make-up styling head. She had suction caps on the base so the toy could be attached to a table top whilst hair styling and make-up techniques could be practised. She also had an extraof hair inside the head, a small handle on the side of the base was turned to either make the hair grow or shrink back into the head, allowing her ‘stylist’ to change her hair style orwithout resulting to a pair of scissors. It could also be washed and styled using ‘human products’ without much damage to the hair itself. Tiny Tears was the must have ‘hi-tech’ doll of the s. No other toy possessed the ability to wet itself or cry ‘real-le’ tears, nor a baby’s bottle from which the liquid disappeared to produce the aforementioned seepage. Such was the level of innovation of the toy that Palitoy won the toy of the year award for it. Sexual equality has never been an issue for the toy manufacturing industry with its dedicated adherence to commercial gain based on pandering to the pockets of the parents of boys and girls. In the s The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man covered these markets perfectly and will equally huge financial success which was ensured by the importation of the American TV series to these shores. Starring Lindsay Wagner the show aired between  and . The Bionic Woman series features Jaime Sommers, who takes on special high-risk government missions using her superhuman bionic powers. The Bionic Woman series was a spin-off from the s Six Million Dollar Man television science fiction action series. Like its parent program The Bionic Woman spawned its own line of toys. Kenner produced a -inch doll of the character, with similar features to the Steve Austin version , except instead of a bionic eye the dolls head would click when turned, simulating the sound of Jaimes bionic ear. Accessories for the doll released by Kenner included additional fashions, and a Bionic Beauty Salon playset. A metal lunchbox for children was available, as was a vinyl story record produced by Wonderland Records. Kenner produced a series of stickers and temporary tattoos featuring Jaime Sommers inidually and with Steve Austin. Considered as much a symbol of the s as much as any other item, the space hopper was actually invented in Italy by a company called Ledragomma which specialised in manufacturing rubber balls. Essentially, the hugely popular toy was a large heavy rubber balloon with two handles sticking out of the top and was inflated by a bicycle or car tyre pump. Children sat on the top of the hopper, held the two handles and bounced about to their hearts content.

However, its perhaps a forgotten fact that the beautul Christmas carol was written within the walled city of Derry. Originally written as a poem by Cecil Frances Alexander, the carol was first published in  in her work, Hymns for Little Children. A year later in , the English organist Henry John Gauntlett discovered the poem and set it to music. Mrs Cecil Frances Alexander was born at  Eccles Street, Dublin in April . She was the third child of Major John Humphreys of Norfolk and Elizabeth . Major Humphreys was land agent to the Fourth Earl of Wicklow and also to the Second Marquess of Abercorn. googletag.cmd.push Cecil Frances love of writing verse began in childhood and some of her inspiration came from a Dr Walter Hook, Dean of Chichester Cathedral. Her father encouraged her writing from a very young age and as a result she began a career as a prolic writer of hymns. By the time of her death at the age of  she had penned over  such works. In , Cecil Frances Humprheys married clergyman William Alexander in Strabane. He was later to become the Church of Ireland Bishop of Derry and Raphoe and the Primate of All Ireland. Bishop Alexander also wrote several books of poetry, the best known of which was St Augustines Holiday and Other Poems. googletag.cmd.push Mrs Alexanders later religious work was strongly influenced by her contact with the Oxford Movement and particularly John Keeble who edited her most famous anthology-Hymns for Little Children. In fact, the work had reached its th edition by the close of the th century. However, by the s, Cecil Frances Alexander had already become famed as a hymn writer. Her compositions became a steadfast feature of Church of Ireland hymnals and she also contributed lyrical and narrative poems to Dublin University Magazine under ious pseudonyms. Seven of these hymns were included in the  Church of Ireland Hymnal and eighteen more were included in A Supplement to Hymns Ancient and Modern in . Mrs Alexander was a involved in charitable work for most of her le and she was involved with sting up the Derry Home for Fallen Women and worked on the development of a district nursing service. Another classic hymn penned by Mrs Alexander, There Is a Green Hill Far Away has obviously endured the test of time but few realise the part that it has played in transforming the education of deaf children almost  years ago in the north of Ireland. Cecil Frances Alexander and her sister Anne were heavily involved in local church activities in Strabane including their visits to local families. On one of the visits they met a young deaf boy from a poor home in the area. They were greatly concerned about the loneliness of his existence and the fact he was alienated from learning, especially about Christian way of le. Both Cecil and Anne persuaded their father to allow them to use a small out building in the grounds of his home-Milltown House so they could establish a school for deaf children. It was a passion that would Cecil Frances would continue for the rest of her le and she dreamt of establishing a much larger institution of this kind. The proceeds from Hymns for Little Children made a hefty contribution to to what became known as the Derry and Raphoe Diocesan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Cecil Frances dream became reality in September  when just a few weeks before she married William the foundation stone of the school was laid. Despite the onset of the Famine in the s education for deaf children in Ireland flourished and other schools of this nature opened up in Belfast, Dublin and Cork. Frances school first opened its doors in the summer of . In the following five years the school took in almost  children teaching skills that would help them succeed in a hearing world. Cecil Frances Alexander died on October ,  and was laid to rest in Derry City Cemetery. Rev Dr William Alexander, who had been born in Devon on April , in Devon passed away aged  on September ,  and was buried with his we. In , two years after William Alexanders death, a stained glass window by James Powell in memory of Cecil Frances was installed at the northern vestibule of St Columbs Cathedral in Derry financed by public donations. The three lights of the window refer to three of her hymns-Once in Royal Davids City, There Is a Green Hill Far Away and The Golden Gates Are Lted Up. Mrs Alexander is also commemorated by an Ulster History Circle blue plaque on Derrys Bishop Street. One of her most famous quotes remains: Do no sinful action, speak no angry word ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord. Since , the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at the Kings College Chapel Cambridge has begun its Christmas Eve service, with Dr Arthur Henry Manns arrangement of Once in Royal Davids City as the Processional hymn. Mann was organist at Kings between  and . In his arrangement, the first verse is sung by a boy chorister of the Choir of Kings Chapel as a solo. The second verse is sung by the choir, and the congregation joins in the third verse. Excluding the first verse, the hymn is accompanied by the organ. According to the tradition of the Kings College Choir, the soloist of this hymn is usually chosen on the day of the performance, when the choirmaster decides whose voice is the strongest on the day right before the broadcast. This carol was the first recording that the Kings College Choir under Boris Ord made for EMI in . Among others who have recorded it are Mary Chapin Carpenter, The Chieftains, Daniel ODonnell, The Seekers, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Petula Clark, Jethro Tull, Sineacutead OConnor and Sufjan Stevens, St. Pauls Choir School and most recently by the Irish group Celtic Woman in their album Voices of Angels.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours. Most families will have seven or more courses including antipasti, a small portion of pasta, a roast meal followed by two salads and two puddings – then, cheese, fruit, brandy and chocolates. The Austrians take a more austere approach and on Christmas Day traditionally sit down to braised carp served with gingerbread and beer sauce. Poland pays no heed to the turkey at all. In fact they pay no mind to meat at all and knuckle down to  meat free dishes that represent the months of the year and which includes fish such as pike, herring and carp. Other typical Polish Christmas dishes are fish soup, sauerkraut with wild mushrooms or peas and traditional dumplings with ious fillings.

It’s either too dry, there’s no taste from it at all, and to avoid both those complaints requests are made for the ‘dark’ meat to be served to you. But still the vast majority of us will sit down to eat turkey on Christmas Day – but how did the big bird from America find its way onto our plates and manage to remain a permanent Yuletide fixture for centuries  googletag.cmd.push Turkeys were first brought into these islands in  by explorer William Strickland and before that those who had the money to buy them ate geese, boars heads, pheasant and even peacocks. Yorkshire man Strickland acquired six of the birds from native American traders on his travels around the New World and duly shipped them back to England. With the arrival of the turkey, a th century poem described Christmas dinner as: “Beefe, mutton and porke, shred pies of the best, pig, veal goose and capon and turkey well drest.” This was accompanied by cheese, apples, nuts and “good drink.” The turkey was also devoured because of purely pratical reasons by farmers because they needed to keep their cows to produce milk and their chickens for eggs. In the sixteenth century eggs were almost a luxury item and were accordingly expensive. googletag.cmd.push It is a matter of historical record that King Henry VIII began the tradition of eating turkey on Christmas Day, but it wasnt really until after WWII that the bird became more popular than goose on the big day. An English farmer, Thomas Tusser noted that by  turkeys had started to adorn Christmas tables, but that as well as geese another bird – the capon – a castrated rooster – remained the fowl of choice. And, that remained the case for another few centuries. By  turkey appears as a meat used in households as noted in a book called The English Housewe written by Gervase Markham. In the s the London Poulters Guild recorded that they had begun to give the company clerk a turkey as a Christmas gt. In the Victorian era, turkey was still too expensive to buy in comparison to its alternatives. There was a ision in tastes between northern and southern England. In the north, roast beef was favoured while in the south, goose remained the traditional choice. Poor families mostly made do with rabbit whether they were from the north or south. Recent research shows that today the average worker will need to toil for around . hours to afford a turkey, but as late as the s it would have cost the average weeks wages to buy one. Eating turkey at Christmas was popularised further by its most recogniseable literary reference. That of course came in  when Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol was published. The character of Scrooge famously sends his put upon clerk Bob Cratchit a huge turkey to replace his goose on Christmas morning. Post  food austerity changed any doubts about the correct choice for Christmas dinner. The sheer size of the turkey could more than adequately feed a sizeable family and the St Stephens Day leftovers could be turned into sandwiches, soup and stew. According to the British Poultry Council more than  million turkeys are killed every year –  million of those for the Christmas season alone. However that figure pales by comparison to the fact that in the U.S.A three hundred million turkeys meet their fate each year – mainly for Christmas and Thanksgiving. But outside of Ireland, Britain and America, turkey is not the favoured roast for Christmas Day. In Norway for example, the festive feast actually takes place on Christmas Eve and most around the costal regions of the country eat fish – mainly cod and haddock and a iety called lutefisk. Inland in Norway they opt for pork chops, specially prepared sausages and sometimes lamb. In neighbouring Sweden the Yuletide consists of a smorgasboard of caviar, shellfish, cooked and raw fish and cheeses. Further east in Ukraine people prepare huge broths crammed with meat while in the Czech Republic tradition decrees that the tree is not lit before Christmas Eve and is then followed by a dinner of fish soup, salads, eggs and carp. A macarbre tradition upheld by the Czechs is that the number of people at the table must be even, otherwise the person without a partner will die the following year. In Germany the traditions are much more straightforward with the Christmas Day feast consisting largely of wild boar or venison. Meanwhile in Jamaica, Christmas dinner usually consists of rice, gungo peas, chicken, ox tail and curried goat. Back in Western Europe, the Christmas dinner in Italy can last four over four hours.

The feast of St Stephen, the first Christian martyr, is marked on  December and in Ireland is often referred to as Laacute Fheacuteile Stiofaacutein or Laacute an Dreoiliacuten or Wren Day. Traditionally, this is also a popular day for visiting family members and going to the theatre to see a pantomimeThe name alludes to several legends including ones found in Irish mythology that link the le of Jesus to the wren bird. In a fading tradition in all but a few parts of Ireland, people dress up in old clothes and straw garments and travel from door to door carrying fake wrens during which those taking part sing, dance and play music.Dependent on which region of Ireland you are in those taking part are called either “wrenboys” or mummers. Mummers carry on the tradition at the village of New Inn, Co Galway and Dingle, Co Kerry. In the North, the tradition is still often observed in Co Fermanagh. The tradition has its roots in ancient Ireland when a real wren was killed and carried around in a holly bush tied to a long pole - these days fake birds are used. The wren is one of the smallest birds in Ireland, but it has a very loud song and is sometimes called the “king of all birds.” This is because of the legend of a little wren who rode on the top of an eagles head and boasted he had “flown higher than an eagle.” Wrens were hunted for many years throughout Europe in medieval times with Ireland no exception to that. In most parts of the island, the tradition died out in the early th century and the rhyme often used during the procession was “The wren, the wren, the king of all birds. On St. Stephens Day was caught in the furze. Although he was little his honor was great. Jump up me, lads, and give us a treat.”In past times, the captured wren was tied to the wrenboy leaders staff or a net would be put on a pitchfork. It would be sometimes cruelly kept alive, as the popular mummers parade song states A penny or tuppence would do it no harm.” The song, of which there are many iations, asked for donations from the townspeople. One iation sung in Edmondstown, County Dublin ran as such: If you havent a penny a halfpenny will do. If you havent a halfpenny, God bless you!”Often the boys gave a feather from the bird to patrons for good luck. The money was used to host a dance or Wren Ball for the town on a night in January. googletag.cmd.push  St Stephen, the first Christian martyr was stoned to death in Jerusalem in Ad . Wrenboys would go from house to house in the countryside collecting money but in the towns the groups were more organised and there was often an element of faction-fighting. In both cases there would be a Wren Captain, usually wearing a cape and carrying a sword, musicians, strawboys and others dressed as old women or other things. It is a day of wild revelry and people usually conceal their identities so they can play tricks on their friends. This type of behaviour is typical of Celtic festivals as a sort of purge. The band of young boys has expanded to include girls, and adults often join in. The money collected from the townspeople is now usually donated to a school or charity.The wren celebration may have descended from Celtic mythology. Ultimately, the origin may be a Samhain or midwinter sacrice or celebration, as Celtic mythology considered the wren a symbol of the past year. The European wren is known for its habit of singing even in mid-winter, and its name in the Netherlands, winter king, reflects this. Celtic names of the wren- draouennig, drean, dreathan also suggest an association with druidic rituals.In the Welsh version of the myth, Lleu Llaw Gyffes, a Celtic hero, wins his name by hitting or killing a wren. He strikes a wren between the tendon and the bone of its leg, causing Arianrhod, his mother, to say it is with a skillful hand that the fair-haired one has hit it. At that Gwydion, his foster father, reveals himself, saying Lleu Llaw Gyffes the fair-haired one with the skillful hand is his name now.And, in the Isle of Man, the hunting of the wren is associated with an ancient enchantress or queen of the fairiesnamed Tehi Tegi which translates to something like beautul gatherer in Brythonic. The Manx spoke Brythonic before they switched to Gaelic. Tehi Tegi was so beautul that all the men of the Island followed her around in hope of marrying her, and neglected their homes and fields. Tehi Tegi led her suitors to the river and then drowned them. She was confronted, but turned into a wren and escaped. She was banished from the Island but s once a year, when she is hunted.The myth most commonly told in Ireland to explain the festival is that God wished to know who was the king of all birds so he set a challenge. The bird who flew highest and furthest would win. The birds all began together but they dropped out one by one until none were left but the great eagle. The eagle eventually grew tired and began to drop lower in the sky. At this point, the treacherous wren emerged from beneath the eagles wing to soar higher and further than all the others.The tradition may also have been influenced by Scandinavian settlers during the Viking invasions of the th to th centuries though it is usually attributed to the Christianising of old pagan festivals by saints to ease the transition and promote conversion. googletag.cmd.push  A depiction of the wrenboys taking part in the St Stephen’s Day procession. Various associated legends exist, such as a wren being responsible for betraying Irish soldiers who fought the Viking invaders by beating its wings on their shields.In , Liam Clancy recorded The Wran Song , which was sung in Ireland by wrenboys. In  Steeleye Span recorded The King on Please to See the King, which also reflects the tradition. They made another version, The Cutty Wren, on their album Time. Hunting the Wren is on John Kirkpatricks album Wassail! The Chieftains made a collection of wrenboy tunes on The Bells of Dublin. In the song, The Boys of Barr na Sraacuteide, which is based on a poem by Sigerson Clford, the wren hunt is also prominent.

This time of year is always one for reflection, and as I look back on  I do so with a sense of pride at serving as your Mayor for the last six months, particularly as the first person from Strabane town to do so. I have experienced so much in my political career, but this has been – and continues to be – one of the most rewarding and enjoyable roles that I have ever held. From when I first took on the Mayoral chain in May, I have had the pleasure of taking part in engagements across our entire District, and even further afield. In those many engagements I have met new faces aplenty from our community groups, schools, charities and all the local organisations who make a positive contribution to our society. So many times I have sat back in awe of the talented, kind, inspiring people that we have here, and that have allowed Derry and Strabane to keep growing as somewhere we are proud to call home. These are people who do so without want for praise, who work tirelessly and quietly behind the scenes, and I want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to them. We have continued to embrace ersity, and all cultures, ages, religions and orientations have been celebrated this year. A particular highlight for me has been engaging with both the younger and older members of our District. I have visited several of our primary and secondary schools and seen for myself the many wonderful young people with whom our future is in very safe hands, while my regular Mayor’s Tea Dances have been thoroughly enjoyable. I’ve heard so many stories, had so many laughs, and enjoyed a few spins and twirls on the dancefloor along the way!Another element of great pride for me has been the money raised for my two chosen Mayor’s charities – Foyle Women’s Aid and the Koram Centre, Strabane. They are two charities close to my heart and representing issues – women’s rights and mental health – that I feel are very prevalent in our society. I have always tried, and will continue to try, to raise awareness of the wonderful work that they both do, and it brings me real joy to know that it has made a positive impact for them. Once againm  has been an award-winning year for the District, with Brooke Park given the prestigious ‘Green Flag’ status for the third year running, while, for the first time, we were victorious in winning the Small City category at the Britain in Bloom awards. Congratulations to everyone who helped us achieve those successes, they were certainly well-deserved. On a regeneration front we have continued to move in a positive direction. In June, we received the fantastic news of €. million of EU PEACE IV funding for the ‘Riverine’ project, which will create an exciting cross-border community space across Strabane and Lford. We have made further investment in our local play parks, including Newtonstewart, while launching our ‘Out to Play’ Play Plan Public Consultation. Furthermore, the opening of the Clooney Greenway and the re-opening of St Columb’s Park Avenue has highlighted our commitment to investment in the regeneration of our beautul District, while work begun on the St Columb’s Park Walled Garden project. We have also been working hard on a corporate front and in that regard it has been a real trademark year. Recently we have published our first Statement of Progress in line with our Strategic Growth Plan. This has been a huge step in our Community Planning process, and one that will help the District develop on a social, economic and environmental front. We also published our draft Local Development Plan which will guide development decisions within our District in a transparent and open way. Linked in with that is our pioneering Green Infrastructure Plan which aims to maximise the number of s that our local parks and green spaces can provide.As well as that, we launched our Council Arts and Culture Strategy which, also in line with the Strategic Growth Plan, is designed to complement Councils Tourism Strategy and Integrated Economic Development Strategy.As a Ballycolman native, I have, of course, been delighted with the ongoing progress of our Strabane Business Improvement District plan. The continued efforts of the BID team has encouraged people to shop locally, while the introduction of additional CCTV cameras in the town, and the granting of planning permission for the Strabane Public Realm project has further encouraged positive development.We also emphasised the importance of giving our young people a voice when I hosted our Local Democracy Week in the Guildhall in October for primary schools and secondary schools , while our recent careers fairs in Derry and Strabane gave them a chance to learn more about their future.Meanwhile, in November I travelled as part of our north-west trade delegation, alongside Donegal County Council, to Boston and Philadelphia. It was a trip of real signicance in ensuring that we continue to strengthen our business links and personal relationships with those across the Atlantic, while I was also delighted to meet with some of our diaspora. As Mayor I am in a unique position where I have a  to bring attention to ious issues, and I have been happy to do so in supporting organ donation week, gas safety week and blind cord safety awareness. In September, I was honoured to speak at the th International Association of Suicide Prevention conference, held in our city. I have also been passionate in my support for the battle against domestic violence. As I mentioned regarding my Mayor’s charities, these are two issues that are, unfortunately, extremely relevant in our current society and ones that I will continue to support wholeheartedly. While there have been so many things to celebrate this year, I’d also like to take a moment and reflect on those we have lost. The death of Ivan Cooper in June was something deeply felt not just across Derry, but on a national scale. Ivan’s role in the history of the city is one that cannot be underestimated, and we continue to remember the actions that he, and others, took which paved the way for all of us to enjoy a more prosperous future. We also lost Pat Gillespie in August, at the age of . Aptly nicknamed ‘The King of Strabane’, Pat – who was renowned for his collection of bikes and cars - brought a smile to many faces in his long and happy time on this earth, and he leaves behind a legacy that will be felt in the town for many more years to come thanks to the kind donation from his family of some items from his archive. I’d like to take this opportunity to once again offer my condolences to Ivan and Pat’s family and friends, and to all who have lost loved ones in the last year. Our District is one that has always been welcoming to all, and we had a host of events that showed the very best of what we have to offer for both our local community and our hundreds of thousands of visitors. Once again, the Street Food Festival, Strabane Summer Jamm, Waterside Half Marathon, Sperrins and Killeter Walking Festival, Slow Food Festival, Culture Night and Fashion Fest all proved huge successes. We had a fantastic year celebrating our young people with the Rewire Festival for Youth, while in July Derry played host to the National Cycling Championships – an iconic moment in our sporting history. We had the chance to mark our illustrious heritage with the Walls  programme, and ersity was at the fore as I attended and led the Foyle Pride parade in August. Indeed, I have been delighted to immerse myself in all cultures in , and in September it was my pleasure to host a Chinese cultural celebration in the Guildhall. As always, our Halloween festival proved to be bigger and better than ever before – with Derry making headlines around the world. And so, we all turn our attentions to a new year. Now at the halfway point of my tenure as Mayor, I can only hope that the next six months will be as wonderful and rewarding as the last. In our current climate, the role of local councils has become more important than ever before, and I am honoured to stand at the helm of that. But, the bottom line is that it isn’t about me or my fellow councillors, it is about you – the people of Derry and Strabane. You are what makes this District what it is, and it is a privilege to work for and alongside you to make sure we are the best that we can be. I would like to wish all of you a happy and healthy Christmas and New Year, and I look forward to meeting more of you in the months ahead. Already there is so much to look forward to in , and I, for one, cannot wait. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In October I was part of a campaign in support of the International Day of Older Persons, and the tea dances are a brilliant way to tie into that because it gets everyone up and about, chatting, enjoying themselves, and having a few dances.

Stute have at least ended a run of three successive defeats with another important point on board but it will be Dungannon who will be the happier of the two sides as they remain five points ahead of Stute at the bottom of the Danske Bank Premiership.Stute boss Sean Connor made a number of changes to his team following last weeks heavy defeat to Glenavon at the Brandywell with defensive pair Conor Tourish and Dean Curry coming in, while midfielder Niall Grace and Cormac Burke both started.Stute started well and should have taken a third minute lead as Shaun Leppards right wing cross was flicked on cleverly by Gareth Brown at the near post, straight into Graces path, but the midfielder volleyed over from close range with the goal at his mercy.Undeterred by that, Stute kept coming and they deservedly took the lead on seven minutes as Burke, marked histo Stangmore Park with a goal.The midfielders initial left wing corner was punched clear by Swts keeper Stuart Addis, and Grace passed the loose ball back out Burke, who cut inside before calmly curling the ball into Addis bottom left hand corner.That lead could have disappeared immediately however as a goalkeeping error by Rory Brown nearly gted the home side an equaliser. The Stute stopper came rushing out of the penalty error but lost the ball to Ben Gallagher, but fortunately for the Stute keeper, the strikers chip to the guarded net sailed wide.The game was level after ten minutes however as Dungannon hit an impressive equaliser. Seanan Clucas won a free-kick some  yards from goal, and Douglas Wilsons resultant strike gave Brown no chance as the ball sailed into the keepers top right hand corner.Connors men missed a great chance to regain the lead on  minutes when, following a quick counter attack, left-back Colm McLaughlin raced in behind the Swts defence, but his attempted dink was well saved by the out-rushing Addis.In an entertaining game with chances at both ends, Stute went back in front just past the half hour as Burke saw his curling free-kick from the left, rattled the crossbar and Evan Tweed was on hand to make sure on the line, firing home into the net.Stute took that lead into the break.Half Time -Stute continued to attack in the second half and the woodwork and some last ditch defending denied them scoring a third goal as Callum Byers nearly headed into his own net, but the ball came back off the crossbar and Leppards follow-up effort was blocked by Kris Lowe.Swts were reduced to ten men on  minutes after Douglas Wilson was shown a straight red card after tangling with Stute substitute Brendan McLaughlin.It should have been straightforward from there for Stute but the ten men levelled things completely against the run of play as Byrnes long punt down field wasnt dealt with by Conor Tourish, and the impressive Ben Gallagher found Michael Carville on the edge of the box whose snap-shot somehow found the net.TeamsDungannon Swts: Addis , Byers, Redman , Wilson, Clucas, Teggart, Patton , Lowe, Carvill, Gallagher, Fitzpatrick.Institute: R Brown, Leppard, Tourish, D Curry, C McLaughlin McNamee, McCauley, Grace, Tweed G Brown, Burke .Referee: Tony Clarke . googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The principal cast performed like seasoned professionals, bringing the iconic characters to le with flair and panache.Eoin McGuinness and Ellen McGurnaghan were outstanding in their comic portrayals of Gomez and Morticia Addams, while Annie Haughey and Eoin Moore were superb as the sinister siblings, Wednesday and Pugsley.The hilariously embarrassing grandmother was played by Aisha Oladipupo, and Year  student Conaire Laverty brought endless laughs as the grunting Lurch. Conn Murnin, as Uncle Fester, was a particular audience favourite and his departure on a rocket to seek the love of his le mdash the Moon mdash was a highlight of the show.The ever present long dead Addams ancestors were a tight and focused chorus including a stunning range of costumes from cavemen to flappers. All-American family, the Beinekes, played by Malachy McGrady, Elisha Tumelty and Tomaacutes Harkinleft the audience in stitches as they struggled to deal with ways of the weird and wonderful Addams family. All ended happily ever after, however, as both families moved towards the darkness and embraced who they really were.Featuring an exceptional live orchestra led by Head of Music Celeste McEvoy and music teacher Ciara Coleman, and with magnicent set, costume, lighting and sound complementing the breathtaking musical and dramatic talent of these students, it really was a show not to be missed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Post Office remains  ","story":"RESIDENTS in Ballynahinch will continue to have access to a first class Post Office service in the New Year after all.Days after it was suggested that the current office in Lisburn Street would close temporarily on January , it was confirmed this week that there will be no break in service.The current postmistress will vacate her position on January  with M Retail Ltd taking over the service the following day.Mrs Donna Carlisle mdash who is the current postmistress mdash said everything will continue as normal in the New Year and that there will be no interruption to services.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker, who said last week that it was his understanding that the Ballynahinch Post Office was to close temporarily, is delighted that normal service is to continue.He said post offices are at the heart of communities and are used by a wide range of people, in particular the elderly, who enjoy the face-to-face contact with staff.ldquoBallynahinch is the districtrsquos third largest town and I am pleased that there will be no interruption to postal services, he continued.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices rather than banks.

The boys are all training hard and we are working on a few dferent permutations for the decider, but it will definitely be horses for courses.ldquoTony McIlhone, Jack McLaughlin and Adam and Gareth George will be key for us in the final. Their experience should stand us in good stead, but I have absolutely no doubt that our young players will rise to the occasion, he added.Fitzsimmons paid tribute to Gerard Kelly, who led the team, to Harry Clarke Cup success last season with Kieran Sharvin and who is still in the management team.ldquoIt is a pleasure and honour to work alongside Gerard, who puts so much effort into keeping the club going. We have been friends for many years and work so well together, he said.ldquoWe have come up with a few ideas on how to get at Ballynahinch Olympic, but we will leave that information to the changing rooms in Meadowvale.Barry McGoran and Marty Sloan have moulded Ballynahinch Olympic Town into a force to be reckoned with, despite the fact that they rarely field with the same  every week due to first team call-ups.As a reserve team, people tend to write them off in the big games, but theyrsquove consistently proved that theyrsquore good enough to compete with anyone.The squad has done exceptionally well to get to another final, but they wont be happy until they get our hands on the cup.McGoran and Sloan like to play the same way as Killough and use the tactic of attack being the best means of defence and Barry feels that Olympic arenrsquot far away from lting the trophy.ldquoWersquore only half way there and need to stay focused. We got a bit carried away last year, but wersquove learnt from that. We need calm heads now, hesaid.ldquoKillough will go into the final as favourites. Theyrsquore a good side with some quality players, especially in midfield and can be lethal going forward, but so can we. We showed that in the semi-final and we have plenty of quality players ourselves.In lsquokeeper John McMenamin Olympic have an experienced custodian, who is a great shot-stopper and as brave as they come.A mixture of Niall McGlew, Mick Rice, Gavin McMullan, Thomas Rodgers Reece McConnell, Darryl Russell and Liam Sloan will make up a formidable defensive barrier with Simon Marmion handed the playmakerrsquos role in the middle of midfield.Shane Rodgers, Simon Marmion, Jack Roddy, Josh Fennell, Gary Wilson, Daniel Rice, Stephen King, Dylan McCartan and Connor Reid will vie for starting places alongside Marmion leaving the twin threat of Darren Lyons and Aaron McCaffrey up front.This pair compliment one and other perfectly.Both are comfortable on the ball and both are workaholics. Defenders canrsquot take an eye off either one as they will destroy you in a flash.McGoran believes his side are ready to cash in on the success of the clubrsquos first team.ldquo The club has come a long way in recent years and when you see the success that our first team is having its incredible, McGoran beamed.ldquoThe professionalism and dedication they show in training has filtered down through the club and it has inspired the younger players to put the work in to try and get to that level mdash and thatrsquos a big part of why our seconds team is doing so well.ldquoLast year ended up being a disappointing Christmas for the club, so itrsquos up to us all to make sure we put things right this time around..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Department.jpg","title":"Department ‘has just 8 staff members’ to fix all streets lights in province  ","story":"A LEADING government department has warned that it is not able to operate a full street lighting repair service across the district due to cutbacks.The Department of Infrastructure has revealed that its repair budget has been slashed by two thirds, down from just over poundm to around poundm. In addition, roads officials only have eight electricians to repair faulty street lights across the Province, with just five of these working full-time.The crisis facing street lighting repairs has been highlighted this week by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who has been contacted by many concerned residents across the constituency.He said that the government departmentrsquos failure to sanction work to repair street lights mdash which includes replacing faulty wiring and defective bulbs mdash is a major concern for many, in particular, the vulnerable and elderly.Mr McGrath said that while the issue may appear trivial and mundane to some, to a signicant number of others, itrsquos literally is a matter of personal safety.He said many are fearful of injuring themselves due to faulty street lights which plunge areas around their home into darkness.The MLA declared: ldquoThere is barely a street or road in South Down that does not have street lights which are not working. When there are several defective lights in a row, this creates problems.Mr McGrath said that he and his colleagues have been ldquoinundated with repair requests which are passed on to the departmentrsquos street lighting team.He said that while he is full of admiration for the local team who work tirelessly to resolve faulty streetlights in a professional and courteous way, they can only work with the budget they have been given, one which he said falls well short of what is required.ldquoI have written to the Department for Infrastructure and have found out that the budget for street lighting should be poundm a year.

Eight staff from Derry toNewry, and Enniskillen to Ballycastle is not enough and represents a situation that demands action.The MLA confirmed that he has also raised his concerns with the permanent secretary at the helm of the government department asking that in the depths of winter and reduced daylight hours, additional funding will be made to address the issue.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are literally in the dark over what will happen next and need to see some solution to this problem.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure has confirmed that officials have discussed the street lighting situation with Mr McGrath.ldquoWhilst we appreciate his concerns, we have explained that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continues to face budget challenges and resources are not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service, she continued.ldquoThe Departmentrsquos current budget for street lighting repairs is approximately poundm, which is much lower than the pound.m that would be required to provide a full street lighting repair service.The spokeswoman explained that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce, which consists of five full time and three part time electricians.She added: ldquoDue to the restricted service, outages may take much longer than usual to be repaired, with priority being given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Devaney.jpg","title":"Devaney elected as new chairman of Down GAA  ","story":"DOWN GAA elected a new chairman at the annual convention in Newry last Wednesday evening. Bredaghrsquos John Devaney becomes the st holder of the countyrsquos main position, having been selected unopposed to succeed Mayobridge man Sean Rooney.In his first address to delegates, Mr Devaney outlined a strategic vision for the association in the county and a number of areas of focus for his term of office.The key priorities will be the proposed Centre of Excellence, the development of a new coaching plan, recruitment of referees, and a programme to encourage and nurture new and young administrators.Following his election, Devaney said: ldquoThe Ballykinlar Centre of Excellence is clearly the single biggest project that we will have undertaken, and will take time and resource to bring to fruition. ldquoWe have set out our intention and we are determined that it will happen, because it is a fantastic opportunity for the county. But it is only the only project.ldquoThere is quite a lot we can achieve in other areas, on and off the fields of play. Coaching, refereeing, administration, club development and fundraising will also require our attention, he added.ldquoAnd we also want to have the ambition for our teams to reach their potential and challenge for honours. So, the future has real potential for us, but it will require a lot of support, goodwill and a unity of purpose across the county. A native of Killoe in Co Longford, Devaney has been an officer with Down GAA since . He is a former chairman of the Queenrsquos University GAA club and the Higher Education GAA Council, and has served on Ulster Council Management Committee and Central Council.Further details on the proposed new Centre of Excellence at Ballykinlar were outlined at Wednesdayrsquos meeting.Planning permission for the development was submitted earlier last week and the early concept designs of the complex were presented to club delegates.

Muriel worked in the office of the now defunct Ulster Transport company.They met on a bus from Belfast to Portaferry and the rest, as they say, is history.ldquoI think we were both on the bus from Belfast and my mother, who knew Muriel, sat beside her and they began to talk and then we were introduced, said Alan. ldquoI was sitting behind and my mother then invited her down for supper the next night.Muriel interjected jokingly: ldquoI was supposed to be going to a shorthand class, which would have made my dear father much happier, but I mitched off and went to the Ritz pictures instead.ldquoHis mother had already spotted me and approved me as a likely candidate for her son as she believed that I knew how to keep house since I was doing it at home as my mother died when I was very young.Alan said that his motherrsquos approval of Muriel very much matched his own.ldquoI had clapped eyes on her before and I thought she will do very nicely for me. It was a private thought, but my mother must have picked up on it and had some insight, he added.Muriel did come for supper the next night and an invitation to a dance was given by Alan. They courted for over a year and more whenever he was home on leave.Alanrsquos parents, Rachel and Ian, were in the next room when Alan later asked Muriel to marry him and they celebrated with tea and supper again.ldquoI was completely flabbergasted but I would say that it was a romantic proposal, recalled Muriel. ldquoAlanrsquos father was great at tending to an open fire in the sitting room and his mother was a great hostess in making scones and cake for supper, so I think just after his father tended the fire, Alan turned tome and asked me to marry me. I think I said yes with a laugh as it was so unexpected.The couple spent the early years of their marriage in Malta where Alan was stationed and where the eldest two sons where born.While the family spent a short time living in Bangor, they have spent the last  years living Downpatrick where Alan went on to work for Radio Rentals in the town, and later in the British Red Cross Society in Belfast, while Muriel worked for the Saul playgroup and later in Downpatrick Library.The couplersquos love of music and going to the theatre, both in Belfast, and at the former Theatre Upstairs, in Irish Street, Downpatrick, was a shared passion over the years.Even today, they both love to watch or listen to concerts on the radio or TV, with performances perking up them up from a trying day or calling on their Alexa to play some Glen Miller music.Muriel said: ldquoWe both love the theatre and we both absolutely love music of all sorts. If therersquos anything that doesnrsquot suit us, we have a wee word with Alexa and say itrsquos your turn to chose.Alan added: ldquoIrsquove often said isnrsquot it wonderful that we have the same tastes in common and thatrsquos a great start to a marriage as well as a good sense of humour and a short memory.Muriel said: ldquoI think it did help that we did like the same things but I would say donrsquot leave it too long before you say sorry for whatever may have happened or been said between you.

Cllr Enrightrsquos assertion has been rejected by council officials.ldquoThe long-standing plans to publicly finance the redevelopment of public lands in Downpatrick town centre have been abandoned, he claimed.Cllr Enright said business representatives who attended the meeting in Downpatrick were not informed that a proposed road linking Irish Street with St Patrickrsquos Avenue as part of a new one-way system was not proceeding.He said such a scheme mdash which roads officials have said is not viable given the cost and the small impact that it would have on congestion mdash would have eliminated the need for traffic lights on all the main junctions and ldquomassively reduced congestion around the centre of town.Cllr Enright claimed that when he queried the decision, he was informed that the councilrsquos priorities are the Ballynahinch bypass and Newryrsquos southern relief road.He added: ldquoAll this comes hot on the heels of the scandalous proposed closure of Downpatrickrsquos visitor information centre in favour of Newry, progressing greenways around Newry but not Downpatrick and the abandonment of the promised Edward Street one-way system, which was supposed to have been delivered on a short-term basis in  until the new council revisited the roads priority list.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman said the local authority has allocated poundm to the Newry City Centre regenerationproject, with poundm secured from the Belfast Regional City Deal, not the poundm quoted by Cllr Enright.She continued: ldquoIt has been proposed that the development of Downpatrick town centre and the old PSNI station should be done collaboratively between local and central government with intervention from other public sector bodies.ldquoThis remains the case. However, the one-way system for Downpatrick town centre was considered by Transport NI who have advised that this is not viable.The spokeswoman also confirmed that a report was tabled to the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourismlast month which considered the future opportunities for visitor information centres within the district.She added: ldquo This report was held lsquoin committeersquo and no decisions have been made by Newry, Mourne and Down Council with regards to the closures of existing visitor information centres.

He has said before that he doesnrsquot have the authority, yet he made the last offer.She stressed that none of the union members wanted to take strike action but felt compelled to do so as a last resort.Speaking as her union entered the fourth week of industrial action, she said: ldquoThe fact that Unison, RCN, Unite and NIPSA are all taking strike action today reinforces the fact that health care staff feel passionately about the preservation of the NHS and want to restore it to a service that they can be proud of again and will last for generations to come.ldquoAgain we ask the public to support us as they have previously and join us in the fight to restore our health service to a high standard.She called on recently elected MPs to fulfil their promises of support at last weekrsquos strike and added: ldquoWe look to our local MLAs, Department of Health officials and the Secretary of State to address these issues now.She said that Unison would like to thank local businesses which provided the striking staff with food and refreshments during this time, in particular Molloyrsquos in Downpatrick  A in Crossgar, and Down Community Health Committee members for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sinn.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein\u0027s candidate sails home on night of drama at Titanic Centre  ","story":"THE re-election of Chris Hazzard largely went under the radar at last weekrsquos election count in Belfast.Originally due to take place in Magherafelt, the South Down count was switched to the Titanic Exhibition Centre in Belfast in the shadow of the iconic Harland and Wolff shipyard and its imposing Sampson and Goliath cranes which dominate the city skyline.The mainstream media effectively ignored the South Down contest in the run-up to last weekrsquos election and, during the counting of votes across six constituencies in the huge Titanic centre, it was more of the same.Predictably, the media focus was on the North and South Belfast seats where DUP heavyweights Nigel Dodds and Emma Little-Pengelly lost out to Sinn Feinrsquos John Finucane and the SDLPrsquos Claire Hanna respectively.Television cameras were focused on the reaction of the winners and losers in the Belfast constituencies and the arrival of DUP leader Arlene Foster mdash on what was a particularly dficult night for her party mdash and Sinn Fein president Mary Lou McDonald and the republican partyrsquos northern leader Michelle OrsquoNeill.Mr Hazzard, who made history two years ago when he broke the SDLPrsquos -year stranglehold on the South Down seat, was officially declared the winner shortly before .am, but his acceptance speech was brief. As was that of SDLP runner-up Michael Savage.They were the only two South Down candidates who made their way to the podium to thank those who voted for them on a night when Northern Irelandrsquos political environment changed signicantly.With voters across the province electing a majority of nationalist MPs for the first time, it truly was a night of edge-of-the-seat political drama. Itrsquos often said that first itrsquos news then its history, but at the Belfast county centre news and history were inextricably intertwined.Minutes after the South Down result had been declared, the glare of the media spotlight was on official confirmation that the DUP had lost South Belfast.As SDLP supporters and the party faithful cheered loudly for Claire Hanna, the Sinn Fein contingent took a moment out of celebrating Mr Hazzardrsquos victory to watch proceedings.Hazzard was always the favourite for the South Down seat and used a sporting analogy to explain how he felt about the contest. He said favourites donrsquot always win, pointing out how hard he worked on the ground, emphasising that the was never complacent about the challenge he faced from the SDLP.From early in the count, SDLP members said that it looked as though their man was in with a real fighting chance and from the boxes which had been opened, the duo were neck and neck.While some of the Sinn Fein contingent appeared to be sporting furrowed brows early into the counting process, they were always confident that their man would emerge victorious and that he did, albeit with a reduced majority.There were suggestions that unionist voters in the Crossgar area had backed Mr Savage, who was clear throughout his campaign that he would not only be an MP for all, but one who would take his seat in the House of Commons.And while it was reported close between him and Mr Hazzard at one stage, the Sinn Fein man eased ahead in the race to cross the winning line, with the SDLP man left wondering what might have been.He had been given a relatively short lead-in time to last weekrsquos parliamentary pole and while pleased with his performance, he clearly felt he could have done even better and pushed the Sinn Fein man all the way to the line.Elsewhere, Alliancersquos Patrick Brown was one of a number of his partyrsquos candidates who built on their recent success at the EU and local council elections.The Westminster poll was viewed as a key litmus test that would rigorously challenge Alliancersquos recent election surge in a first past the post electoral system which did not rely on the votes of other parties.Mr Brown, who in May trebled his Newry, Mourne and Down Council vote in Rowallane, was at it again. His election agent and fellow councillor, Andrew McMurray, stood for Alliance in  and polled , votes, but Brown more than trebled the Alliance vote, a performance which helped his party leapfrog the Ulster Unionists to become the third largest in the province. Overall, Alliancersquos vote in South Down increased by an impressive . per cent, marking a remarkable performance by Brown.Most signicantly, Alliance now has its eyes focused firmly on securing an Assembly seat and while Mr Brown refused to be drawn on whether he would like his name to go forward should such a contest arise, there is no doubt that he will be the partyrsquos preferred candidate. He left the count centre a happy man his stock within his party continues to rise.Elsewhere, the DUPrsquos Glyn Hanna was pleased with his performance, despite his vote decreasing, and he didnrsquot rule out being the partyrsquos flag bearer in a future Assembly electionthis weekrsquos talks at Stormont fail to restore the power-sharing executive.Ulster Unionist, Jill Macauley, defied pundits suggestions that her party would not do well in South Down, by increasing the UUP vote by almost three per cent.Province-wide, the UUP polled , votes but with a new leader in charge the party did not produce the performance it had been hoping for. However, Mrs Macauley provided it with a glimmer of hope with her performanceAontuacute mdash which was contesting its first election mdash polled , votes but party candidate, Paul Brady, wasnrsquot at the count centre in Belfast where party leader Peader Tobin did call late on Thursday evening.As the last of the media interviews were conducted, television and radio sound engineers were doing their best to drown out the clatter of chairs being piled on top of one another and folding tables used by counting staff collapsed to be packed away.The last of the candidates, party supporters, election staff and the media started to drt away from the Titanic Exhibition Centre around .am, following another night of high drama which signicantly reshaped the provincersquos political landscape..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Special.jpg","title":"Special gift for Lorcán  ","story":"CHRISTMAS came early for Downpatrick toddler Lorcaacuten Maguire who received his first dose of le-extending medication yesterday.His parents have been campaigning to get the expensive drug Orkambi free on the NHS since Lorcaacuten, who has Cystic Fibrosis , was just a few months old.Brave Lorcaacuten, who turns three next month, took his drug at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with the help of some strawberry-flavoured milk.However, it was a bittersweet moment for his mother, Jen Banks, as she knows that other parents of children are still patiently waiting for the drug to became available.She said: ldquoLast Christmas I was dreaming about getting Orkambi but it was a dream that would have meant leaving my home, family, and our amazing NHS to move to the south.ldquoThis year on Christmas morning Lorcaacuten will open his stocking and before he opens the rest of his presents, he will have his morning dose of Orkambi with a few segments of chocolate orange. I am so joyful and thankful as is my husband Dermot and our families.Orkambi was made available freely available following a surprise move by Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly at the end of October.Scotland and the Republic of Ireland made the drug free available to CF sufferers earlier but NHS England wrangled with the drug company over price.Once a deal was agreed in England, it paved the pay for Northern Ireland to introduce Orkambi for patients as young as Lorcaacuten, along with Symkevi, which can be given to children aged  and over.Jen was only informed on Monday that the drug was available for Lorcaacuten following a phone call from his treatment nurse.She said: ldquoI was absolutely shaking holding the phone when they told me that Lorcaacuten could get his medication as he has been fighting off the pseudomonas infection since last November.ldquoOrkambi was being given to those children with the higher clinical need and Lorcaacuten got it because of his infection, but I know of so many other families who have campaigned long and hard as we have.ldquoItrsquos just a matter of sufficient quantities of the drug becoming available as I know that the medical teams are working around the clock to distribute to as many patients as they can.Lorcaacuten was observed for five hours in hospital before he was allowed to go home with what his mother calls his ldquomagic medicine. He will need to take it twice daily from now as well as taking his antibiotics and being nebulised several times a day.However, Jen says that studies have shown that children with CF who take Orkambi from the age of six can live with the condition for an extra  years.ldquoThis is not just a Christmas present for this year, but for all the extra years we hope to have with Lorcaacuten, said Jen.ldquoWhilst I love Lorcaacuten to the bottom of my heart, these past three years have been very dficult. With every infection, my heart has broken a little more.ldquoNow the future is so bright for people with Cystic Fibrosis, so much brighter than I could have ever imagined when we received his diagnosis..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th November 2019 Sunken.jpg","title":"Sunken fishing trawler in Scotland for inspection  ","story":"A FISHING trawler which ran aground and sank off Ardglass harbour has arrived in Scotland for inspection after being raised from the seabed.Specialist lting gear was used to raise the Dillon Owen five weeks after it ran aground on rocks near the entrance to the villagersquos harbour on October .The carefully planned lting operation got underway on December , with the process involving engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.

Mr Ahmed, who is originally from Bangladesh, pictured, is from a Muslim background so Christmas is not a holy day in his religious tradition. He said: “This is my community, I have to do something.”He has been the director of the popular restaurant since  and began the Christmas Day initiative several years ago. He lost his father in  so his mother knows about loneliness and is proud of her son.Mr Ahmed said: “Money is not everything, money comes and goes but that day it was so happy.”“We are all one, that is important to me, we are all human beings.“If I cut my hand the blood comes out red,you cut your hand the blood comes out red.“Religion makes us ided and that is not good. We have to believe we are all human beings and we all support each other.”Queen says that amid a bumpy time for her family and the nation, she is struck by the sense of purpose of the younger generationsRoyal joy as young prince and princess attend Christmas Day church service for first time Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNI road remains closed this morning after man dies in serious road traffic collision -

And people really enjoy coming down to volunteer, there’s such a lovely atmosphere.” She said that Common Grounds had contacted a few hostels in order to invite members of the homeless community, and refugees and asylum seekers from across the city were expected to be in attendance, as well as “people who were just going to be on their own this Christmas.”She continued: “We have quite a nice mix of people and generations. Lunch organisers Djamila McFarlane and Joan Vaughan“And people really have been reaching out and helping us, and have been so generous with their time. It really has overwhelmed us.”Joan said that the cafe was the perfect place to host such an event as well, due to its “cosy” and intimate atmosphere. “We had a lot of comments from people last year saying they felt like they weren’t rushed away after their dinner, and were able to sit on the sofas and relax with a coffee. We’ll have some befrienders there as well who will be inconspicuous and keep an eye out just in case there are people who want to have a chat, and aren’t lonely within a crowd.” She continued: “There are lots of other places doing this kind of thing now too, such as the Salvation Army, so the concept is growing, which is good..

Our le has changed so much since taking her home with us and we wouldn’t change it for the world.“We definitely have more responsibility with a dog and a set routine, however Kezzie is part of the family and makes our house feel like a home. We can’t wait to spend Christmas with Kezzie she will definitely get lots of toys and treats for dinner too.”Sarah Park, assistant manager at Dogs Trust Ballymena, is delighted Kezzie has found a home in time for the festive season, but urges people to remember that dogs are a substantial commitment and responsibility the old slogan ‘A dog is for le, not just for Christmas’, coined  years ago as part of a nationwide campaign to avoid people treating pets as disposable toys, should still very much be heeded.She said: “We are so glad Kezzie has settled into her new home. “Although we were sad to see her go, we are over the moon because she couldn’t have found a better family. “Although Kezzie is the perfect example of a dog finding their forever home, statistics show online searches for puppies sky-rocket by  per cent in the countdown to Christmas and we would urge the public not to buy puppies or dogs as gts. “Think carefully about the le-long commitment of getting a pet before making the decision. “If someone isn’t sure about whether now is the right time is to welcome a four-legged friend into their home, we would encourage them to support rescue dogs in other ways such as becoming a volunteer foster carer or sponsoring one of our beautul dogs.”Dogs Trust Ballymena currently has  dogs of ying breeds available for adoption.Search for missing man called off as body recovered from Belfast Lough Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies after serious two vehicle collision -

It takes patience and time to rebuild trust, and progress often comes through small steps.“Since the end of the Second World War, many charities, groups and organisations have worked to promote peace and unity around the world, bringing together those who have been on opposing sides.“By being willing to put past dferences behind us and move forward together, we honour the freedom and democracy once won for us at so great a cost.”During the broadcast footage was shown of America’s moon landings, national D-Day commemorations in Portsmouth, and world leaders meeting the Queen during the recent Nato reception at Buckingham Place, which marked the alliance’s th anniversary.The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were featured at a French D-Day service in Bayeux, Normandy, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were shown celebrating St Patrick’s Day with the Irish Guards.Speaking about how Jesus showed the world that “small steps taken in faith and in hope can overcome long-held dferences”, the Queen added: “Many of us already try to follow in his footsteps.“The path, of course, is not always smooth, and may at times this year have felt quite bumpy, but small steps can make a world of dference.”The Queen’s comment about experiencing a “bumpy” year is thought to be her first public reference to the personal events involving her family during the past  months.During , the Duke of Edinburgh was involved in a dramatic car accident, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex spoke about their struggles living in the public eye, and the Duke of York gave a disastrous television interview about his friendship with a convicted sex offender.The Queen also paid tribute to the men and women of the emergency services and the armed forces, and remembered those on duty this Christmas working to keep the nation “safe and secure”.At the end of the broadcast footage was shown of the Queen, Charles, William and Prince George preparing Christmas puddings earlier this month at Buckingham Palace for the Royal British Legion’s Together at Christmas initiative.try catch  TrendingNI road remains closed this morning after man dies in serious road traffic collision -

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns.

There looks to be a change around mid-month to milder conditions, although the timing is very uncertain.\"This change looks likely to bring milder and wetter conditions across most parts of the UK, allowing temperatures to recover to around average, or perhaps slightly above.\"The wettest conditions are likely to be in the north and west, with an increased likelihood of drier spells in the south and southeast.\"Colder interludes are still possible.\"There have only been four occasion in the UK in the last  years where more than  per cent of stations in the UK reported snow on the ground at am.After -cm of snow fell in the Highlands and mph winds occurred on the Welsh Coast a few weeks ago, bookmakers started offering odds on snowfall in a number of cities across the UK.However, betting odds have now changed, suggesting snow is less likely to fall in the UK this Christmas.A spokesman for William Hill said: \"At this stage of the year, the odds always suggest that a White Christmas is a long shot.\"Its - against snow in Aberdeen on Christmas Day, - against snow in Glasgow, - against snow in Edinburgh, and - snow in Newcastle.London is -.According to long range weather forecaster Exacta Weather, there could be blizzards on Christmas Day followed by a freezing cold January. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He is expected to defeat Mr Saar and a win could strengthen his hand going into the next national vote.But Mr Saar, who has garnered support from a handful of Likud backbenchers, could benefit from stormy weather that might keep turnout low. If he wins, he would become Likudrsquos candidate for prime minister in the March polls.ldquoWe are imbued with the spirit of victory, Yoav Kisch, Saarrsquos campaign manager, told Israeli Army Radio. ldquoThis candidacy is good for the party and I believe can also bring the change and the hope for a revolution in the Likud. -- vw,vw,px, px\"People look at a poster of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Hadera  --Mr Netanyahu faces charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three corruption cases in which he is accused of trading legislative or regulatory favours in exchange for lavish gts or favourable media coverage. He denies wrongdoing and has waged an angry campaign against the media and law enforcement officials he said are bent on ousting him from office.

often I think it comes down to the mental approach, having the right focus to stay professional in your preparations despite everything  going on with the holiday season.“From starting out in management I’ve always had my teams in for a training session just ahead of Boxing Day, not so much for tactics or fitness but really just a way of getting the squad together for that final time before the match.“It helps keep everyone sharp and, hopefully, we can get the right result in Loughgall and end the year in top spot.“That is the target as you set goals along the way and sitting first at the start of the new year is a marker which can benefit the squad.”Portadown recovered from defeat to Ballinamallard United with a -

by moving the opposition and maintaining control, eventually players tire and that leads to extra space, which we can try to exploit.“The final goal was the culmination of that teamwork and it was pleasing to see the players still strive towards that at -.”\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic update road closed major disruption expected ","story":"Return to top flight remains the target for Portadown says Matthew TiptonNI pizza restaurant to create  new jobsNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsTraffic and TravelTraffic update -

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
