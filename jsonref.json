Pictured, with his wife Camilla at the Braemar Gathering last weekIn a statement about the tiff between Andrew and Johnstone-Burt, a spokesman said:  ‘Some time ago there was a disagreement between the Duke of York and a member of staff. The disagreement was resolved and there are no ongoing issues’.The disagreement was said to have happened at the beginning of this month, and sources had previously told the Mail on Sunday that Prince Andrew had been \u0027very cross\u0027 and it was even thought that Prince Charles had asked him to apologise.  There was said to have been words on both sides but no actual physical altercation between the two parties.‘It was a verbal dispute. It was a work-related issue. The Duke got very cross that what he wanted wasn’t possible.’         Mr Johnstone-Burt (pictured above) looks after teams including catering, housekeeping and entertainmentPrince Charles subsequently heard of the row and asked his brother to say sorry.The source added: ‘The Duke explained the situation to the Prince of Wales and left it at that. There was no apology because there was nothing to apologise for. The Duke maintains a good relationship with the Prince of Wales.’ Johnstone-Burt, who has worked at the palace for six years, is responsible for 250 staff covering catering, housekeeping, entertainment, maintenance and administration.On September 7, a source close to Charles said such an intervention would not be unusual. ‘He is the second most senior member of the family and is known to take action when and where is necessary.‘Mostly he is well informed and will intervene where it is appropriate to do so.’He is also in charge of a £370 million, ten-year re-fit of the Queen’s official London residence.Johnstone-Burt joined the Royal Navy in 1977 and served in the Falklands before eventually being promoted to vice-admiral and becoming the Chief of Staff to Nato’s Supreme Allied Command Transformation at Norfolk, Virginia.He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath by the Queen in 2013.        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/07/18/09/0693FF60000003E8-7260117-Victims_top_row_left_to_right_Elaine_McIver_43_Saffie_Roussos_8_-m-57_1563438293124.jpg","title":"Lady Orchadleigh House admits pinch unbelievable home","story":"Share this article She had heard a lot about the new Lord of the Manor, and at a party on the estate in the summer of 2015, she finally met him.‘I was bowled over,’ she recalls. ‘Who could fail to be? Chris is so full of life and fun. We realised we had so much in common. Most of all, I was stunned that a stranger could love Orchardleigh as much as I did.’Two weeks later — after a first dinner date at nearby Charlton House Hotel — she finally walked through the grand wooden doors of Orchardleigh House and was able to explore inside the house she had loved so much from the outside.‘The scale and size of the rooms blew me away,’ she said. ‘I loved the extravagant details — the parquet floors, the stained glass windows, the plasterwork shells above the doors and the staircase that seemed to go on for ever.’Heather rapidly found herself being sucked into helping Chris. ‘I needed a feminine touch with the furnishings,’ he admits cheerfully.Their relationship proceeded at breakneck speed. ‘I knew I was head over heels with him within the week,’ says Heather.          Some of Chris’s additions are a little unorthodox. In the middle of the exquisite parquet floor in the morning room, in place of the Duckworths’ hand-woven Turkish rug, lies a square of decidedly utilitarian industrial-strength carpet. The pair are pictured together above‘We share the same sense of humour, the same philosophy of life. I love his kindness, his fairness and the way he treats everyone equally.‘In January 2017 he took me off on his yacht for four months. We sailed 1,600 miles from Cannes to the Canary Islands. It was wildly romantic but also deeply testing — you really get to know someone on a small boat. From then on we were inseparable.’On New Year’s Eve the couple got engaged and they were married in the little chapel on the estate on August 19 this year. After their honeymoon in Devon, Heather moved into Orchardleigh House with her children.‘The kids love it — they have known the house since they were babies and are wildly excited,’ she says.With its numerous buildings, including the remains of a 15th-century castle, Orchardleigh can host two weddings simultaneously and Chris employs a staff of 80, including six groundsmen. ‘Our next project is to offer three-day wedding events, starting in the castle and moving on to the house, then our newly restored Palladian-style boathouse,’ he says.Some of Chris’s additions are a little unorthodox. In the middle of the exquisite parquet floor in the morning room, in place of the Duckworths’ hand-woven Turkish rug, lies a square of decidedly utilitarian industrial-strength carpet.         Orchardleigh House fell into disrepair after developers who planned to turn it into a luxury hotel resort went bust. After the entire contents had been auctioned off by Sothebys for £3.5 million, English Heritage put the mansion, by that time a shell, on its ‘at risk’ register. Then in early 1999, ebullient entrepreneur Chris Vincent roared down the drive in his Bentley and fell instantly in loveAs for the ‘lost’ artworks that once hung in Orchardleigh, Chris has simply had them copied by drawing on Sotheby’s auction records. He has also added other ‘masterpieces’ for good measure. There are lurid versions of everything from Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus to a painting of a galloping Napoleon.But his determination to be true to the fabric of the house is impressive. No walls have been removed or added and the kitchen, where caterers now prepare food for wedding banquets, has the original Victorian range and steam-driven plate warmer.In the flagstoned hallway hangs the line of 33 bells the Duckworths used to summon staff. Labels include ‘Mr Duckworth’s Business Room’ and, rather perplexingly, ‘Bachelor’s Bedroom West’.‘English Heritage tell me they are the best array of bells in the country,’ Chris says proudly.As she adapts to her new role, Heather takes comfort in the family’s motto, inscribed on one of Orchardleigh’s oriel windows: non nobis solum (not only for ourselves).‘The Duckworths might very well be surprised to see me in their house,’ she says with a smile. ‘But I hope they’d be pleased. After all, I’ve always loved the house every bit as much as they did.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Car makers leave handbrakes future switch electronic devices","story":"Share this article Some motorists may be dubious about the safety or reliability of the new technology after a spate of recalls by brands for potentially faulty electronic brake systems.Volkswagen issued a recall for 134,000 UK cars in 2017 over problems with its parking brake, affecting Golf, Touran, Tiguan and Passat models.The same year, Tesla issued a global recall of 53,000 cars and Audi, Renault and Toyota have all also had to recall models over electronic brake faults in the past.The risk of hacking attacks also rises as ever more electronics are introduced into vehicles.Researchers have previously demonstrated their ability to hack the computers in cars, remotely controlling steering, acceleration and braking.The AA says it is \u0027broadly in favour\u0027 of electronic systems as they hold cars more securely but warns that they could confuse drivers without \u0027consumer education\u0027.          Within a few years, mechanical handbrakes will be consigned to history alongside chokes, cassette players and wind-up windows (stock photo)Its head of road policy Jack Cousens said: \u0027Electronic parking devices are simple to use and reduce the scope for human error as they set the brake tension to the correct level.\u0027They put an end to cars rolling down inclines because the handbrake was not fully on and they make hill starts easier.\u0027We see it more as a consumer education issue for car buyers or hirers.\u0027It is simply a ten second lesson where the garage or car hire firm points out the device, so that drivers are not left scrabbling around, wondering where the handbrake is.\u0027He said that electronic systems remove the physical effort of yanking a chunky lever and free up space in the centre console.With the technology - first used on the BMW 7 Series in 2001 - becoming ever more affordable, the manual method is likely to be phased out entirely over the next few years.The CarGurus study found that only 30 per cent of new models now have handbrakes, down from 37 per cent in 2018.CarGurus UK editor Chris Knapman confirmed that the handbrake is heading for extinction..He said: \u0027It\u0027s official, the death of the handbrake is coming as manufacturers switch to electronic parking brakes in huge numbers.\u0027They have rapidly gone from being a novelty to what our research shows is now the norm.\u0027Within the next few years we expect the number of cars on sale with traditional handbrakes to decline further, likely only to be found on a select number of niche models.\u0027These systems might lack the tactile feel that some drivers value from a traditional manual parking brake but they bring several benefits in terms of convenience, safety and packaging.\u0027An electronic parking brake can engage automatically when a car\u0027s engine is switched off and many also include an auto-hold function that will apply the parking brake when a car is stopped in traffic or on a hill.\u0027Electronic parking brakes are also easier to install than their manual equivalents and replacing a handbrake lever with a simple button frees up more space in a car\u0027s interior – useful perhaps for an extra cup holder or two!\u0027But he added that the trend for electronic devices might take some of the fun out of driving for new motorists.He said: \u0027Of course, the benefits can\u0027t be ignored but as the latest technology trickles through manufacturer line-ups, many new drivers might never experience one of the most familiar of automotive features.\u0027The temptation to attempt flamboyant handbrake turns is soon to be a thing of the past too!\u0027Earlier this week, it emerged that some of the world\u0027s biggest makers of self-driving cars want US regulators to remove the requirement for steering wheels, pedals and mirrors.Companies including Honda, Uber, Waymo and Lyft, which are developing autonomous cars, want the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to recognise self-driving cars as a separate vehicle class to address the rules. "},{"url":null,"title":"Sir Geoffrey Boycotts ex girlfriend insists doesnt deserve knighthood","story":"Share this articleSir Geoff Boycott’s ex slams knighthood for star who beat her to a bloody mess in hotel attack – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"MIT scientist appears DEFEND Jeffrey Epstein","story":"Share this article He later reportedly added: \u0027It is morally absurd to define rape in a way that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17.\u0027Stallman has allegedly written dozens of posts on his personal website in favor of legalizing pedophilia and child pornography, in posts that go back as far as 15 years, The Daily Beast reported. On his personal site, stallman.org, he is claimed to have written in favor of limiting laptop searches, particularly at the U.S. border.Talking about \u0027child pornography\u0027 he allegedly wrote: \u0027It might be an image of a sexually mature teenager that any normal adult would find attractive.

She worked as a guitar teacher and a toy shop sales assistant before being signed by Domino Records in 2009. Brian Eno was an early champion, calling Calvi “the biggest thing since Patti Smith” and singing and playing on her debut album. She’s also collaborated with David Byrne, Marianne Faithfull and PJ Harvey producer Rob Ellis. Calvi’s guitar-driven art-rock sound is often described as dark and cinematic, so it’s not too surprising that she’s recently scored series five of Peaky Blinders.Influences: Black Midi’s name comes from an internet music genre the band learned of via YouTube, a video frontman Geordie Greep has said they “haven’t spent more than five minutes watching”. The four-piece experimental rock band initially bonded over a shared love of Talking Heads, Deerhoof and Danny Brown, but that doesn’t mean these acts are “influences” in the traditional sense. According to Greep, “there’s stuff we all like, but it’s not like we all like stuff that we based the band on sort of thing. We’ve tried to keep the band quite distinct from what we like.”Scene: Black Midi formed at the Brit School, the Croydon performing arts institution known for cultivating Adele, Amy Winehouse and Jessie J. They then honed their live skills at Brixton venue the Windmill, a bastion of the south London indie scene. Though they’re hardly typical Brit School alumni, the group acknowledge they owe a debt to their time there. “You do shows every term and stuff,” Greep has said. “So once you get out you’ve got a really good idea of how sound works. It meant we left school, could play at the Windmill and knew how to soundcheck straight away.”Influences: Growing up in Wales in the 90s, Cate Le Bon’s father would make her mixtapes introducing her to seminal artists such as Neil Young and the Velvet Underground. She was also drawn to California rockers Pavement and two leading Welsh bands of the era, Super Furry Animals and Gorky’s Zygotic Mynci. Her shortlisted album Reward grew from a year of “self-imposed isolation” in Cumbria where she spent her time woodworking by day and later, “playing the piano and singing into the night”.Scene: Born in Carmarthenshire, Le Bon’s roots lie in the Welsh indie scene. She first came to prominence opening for Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys on his 2007 solo tour, then singing on I Lust U, a standout track from Rhys’s electro-pop side project Neon Neon. She’s since released five albums, collaborated with John Cale and the Manic Street Preachers, and co-produced an album by American indie rockers Deerhunter. She’s revered by peers including St. Vincent and Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy, who earlier this year described Le Bon as “pretty much my favourite artist”, going on to say: “I’m mesmerised by her output over the last 10 years.”Scene: Dave is a leading light of the blossoming British hip-hop scene. Fellow London rappers Stormzy and Wiley supported him early on then Dave’s profile grew again when US superstar Drake jumped on a remix of his 2017 track Wanna Know. More recently, the 21-year-old has collaborated with several other London rappers including Headie One, J Hus and Fredo, who featured on Dave’s chart-topping single Funky Friday. This year, Dave has underlined his rising star status with a guest spot on Ed Sheeran’s No.6 Collaborations Project.Influences: Oxford band Foals have cited minimalist composer Steve Reich, indie icons Pixies and innovative dance producer Arthur Baker as influences. Frontman Yannis Philippakis has also said that a “general anxiety” caused by Trump, Brexit and climate change fed into their shortlisted album, Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 1. “I was listening to the tracks in the pub and I’d I look up and see a pub garden full of people and realise: ‘We’re all in this shitstorm together.’ I felt the songs should deal with that,” he said recently.Scene: Foals formed in Oxford’s indie scene in 2005. Two band members, frontman Yannis Philippakis and drummer Jack Bevan, were previously part of another band, math-rockers The Edmund Fitzgerald, who disbanded when things apparently became “too serious”. Since releasing their debut album Antidotes in 2008, Foals have been shortlisted for the Mercury Prize on three occasions and become seasoned festival headliners. A follow-up to their shortlisted album, the logically-titled Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost – Part 2, is due in October.Influences: Dublin post-punks Fontaines DC are influenced by the Strokes, the Libertines and the Velvet Underground they’ve called the latter “the base point of modern music”. Frontman Grian Chatten has also cited the Pogues’ 1984 debut album Red Roses for Me as a major touchstone for their own shortlisted debut, Dogrel, saying: “It sounds so raucous but at the same time so intelligent.” But the band’s most formative influence could be their hometown. “I think of Dublin and our music as one and the same, because it was written by people who were intensely absorbed by the city,” Chatten has said.Scene: Inspired by fellow Dubliners Girl Band, whom they credit with “modernising” Irish music, Fontaines DC are part of a new wave of Irish guitar bands making music with a strong social conscience. Discussing the scene earlier this year, Fontaines bassist Conor Deegan III said: “There’s so many things going on in Ireland, socially and politically, that for so long were not being talked about. It feels like there’s a coherent voice for our generation again.” Having toured with Shame and Idles, Fontaines DC also have close connections with the UK guitar music scene.Influences: While often described as a post-punk band, Idles frontman Joe Talbot has said they’re really “a product of different things we love”. The Bristol outfit’s shortlisted second album, Joy as an Act of Resistance, is influenced by the Sex Pistols, Interpol and Welsh post-hardcore group Mclusky, plus garage music, grime and jungle. It’s all funnelled into a righteous and rousing call-to-arms which takes on toxic masculinity, class conflict, immigration and Brexit. The end result isn’t anger, said Talbot, but music that’s “all about opening up and being vulnerable”.Influences: Little Simz said her shortlisted album Grey Area was inspired by “just coming into myself a lot more and being a young woman in my mid-20s and still learning about myself”. The north London artist, whose real name is Simbi Ajikawo, has said that listening to grime as a teenager influenced her writing style, but Grey Area also draws from other sources. Produced by her childhood friend Inflo, it incorporates jazz, funk, soul, rock and trip-hop, and includes collaborations with reggae artist Chronixx, folk-rock singer Michael Kiwanuka and electro-R\u0026ampB band Little Dragon.Scene: Little Simz said earlier this year that “people have struggled with finding where to place me”, adding: “And I think that’s also because I don’t even know where I fit.” This doesn’t mean the north London rapper lacks influential and high-profile fans. Two years ago, Kendrick Lamar said she “might be the illest doing it”, and she’s been tapped for collaborations by Gorillaz, Khalid and alt-j. Simz has even toured with Lauryn Hill, whose seminal album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill was part of her “day-to-day life” when she was growing up.Influences: Neo Jessica Joshua, better known as Nao, grew up in Hackney listening to R\u0026ampB, hip-hop and UK garage, as well as Donny Hathaway, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Conceptually, her shortlisted second album is inspired by astrology’s Saturn return. “It’s this idea that Saturn takes 29 years to orbit from when you’re born and it is the planet of blessings and growth. So by the time you’re around 29, between 27 and 32, something big happens in your life,” 31-year-old Nao says. “You start to rethink everything – old stuff that your parents taught you or ideas that you believed in. It’s like a complete shedding of skin and it can be painful.”Scene: Nao’s unique musical journey means she doesn’t slot neatly into any particular scene. After studying vocal jazz at Guildhall School of Music \u0026amp Drama, she joined all-female beatboxing troupe The Boxettes, who were popular on YouTube. She also put in stints as a backing singer for Kwabs and Jarvis Cocker. When she released her debut album For All We Know in 2016, she often described her sound as “wonky funk”, and she’s since collaborated with Nile Rodgers \u0026amp Chic and Disclosure.Influences: Led by alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, SEED Ensemble is a 10-piece band “combining jazz with inner-city London, West African and Caribbean-influenced groove”. Kinoshi says she’s personally influenced by composers such as Maria Schneider, Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus, and named Driftglass after a collection of short stories by African-American author Samuel R Delany. “This record specifically focuses on interpreting … what driftglass is as an analogy for how improvised music changes and evolves over time depending on its environment,” she says. “Sci-fi, specifically space travel and Afrofuturist references to water and its connection to black history, were also important in its creation.”Influences: Northampton rapper Tyron Frampton, or Slowthai, has varied musical influences ranging from the Beatles to Basement Jaxx, and So Solid Crew to Elliot Smith. He namechecks the Prodigy on Nothing Great About Britain, the title track from his shortlisted debut album, saying: “I am a prodigy – they made me.” He’s also said he related to Radiohead’s Creep during his formative years. His album is an impassioned mix of hip-hop, grime, electronica and punk, so it’s fitting that it features collaborations with both grime icon Skepta and noisenik guitar duo Slaves.Scene: Tyron Frampton, the rapper better known as Slowthai, was born and raised in Northampton. “It’s always been a band town,” he said earlier this year. “There’s always been good music but never a strong scene to keep it going.” His own music mixes hip-hop grit with a scabrous punk energy, but he’s keen not to be pigeonholed, saying: “I want to play guitar, piano, drums, write songs for other people. I can do punk, I can do indie, but as long as it has my voice, it’ll always be my sound.”Scene: The four members of the 1975 met at Wilmslow High School and started making music at 15. At one point, they operated as a punk covers band, but they soon developed their own genre-splicing songwriting style inspired by everyone from Michael Jackson to My Bloody Valentine. Since signing to indie label Dirty Hit and breaking through with 2013’s self-titled debut, band members Matt Healy and George Daniel have co-written tracks for fellow Dirty Hit artists Pale Waves, The Japanese House and No Rome.Watch the 2019 Hyundai Mercury Prize live on Thursday 19th September, BBC Four - 9pm.

Meanwhile his son, convinced they are witnessing a superhero about to take flight, is growing impatient. He urges the man to jump: “Come on and fly already, before it gets dark!”The scene contains several elements that will be familiar to readers of Keret’s eight previous books of stories: mordant humour, a wry take on family life and the juxtaposition of the existential and the mundane. The 52-year-old Israeli author inspires devotion among his fans– Clive James has called him “one of the most important writers alive” – and these 22 tales showcase why. In Keret’s world, whimsy often conceals gut-wrenching wisdom, and heartache usually comes laced with hilarity. If Kafka were reincarnated as a comedy writer in Tel Aviv, his work might look something like this.The invention in these stories is dazzling: time and again, Keret hits on an idea so good that another writer would turn it into a novel. In “Allergies” a childless couple channel their parental feelings into dog ownership, going to deranged lengths to make their adopted pup happy. “Arctic Lizard” imagines a dystopian America where a third-term Trump administration, bogged down in a war with Mexico, tempts teenagers to enlist by creating a video game in which Pokémon-style tokens must be collected from battlefields. “Evolution of a Breakup”, a minor miracle of short fiction, traces the story of a orce back to the origins of life on Earth.One of Keret’s favourite modes is the screwball parable. In “Birthday of a Failed Revolutionary” a lonely billionaire considers what to do with all his money: “Of course, he could have thought about what he’d do with his life, a question no less interesting, but people with that much money are usually too busy to find time for that kind of thinking.” He comes up with the idea of buying other people’s birthdays – “not the actual birthday, which can’t really be bought, but everything that comes along with it: presents, greetings, parties, etc”. Just when you expect a payoff about the limits of materialism, the man’s plan turns out to be wildly successful. In Keret’s imagination there’s a thin line between farce and fable, comedy and tragedy, the everyday and the surreal.But perhaps such contradictions aren’t so surprising from an Israeli author, a land of hi-tech industry and Holocaust survivors, gay pride marches and Hasidic yeshivas, sun-kissed beaches and bomb shelters. Born in 1967, the year his country’s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza began, Keret belongs to a generation that is cynical about prospects for peace. He shows us characters trying to get on with their ordinary lives against a background hum of conflict and violence, like the man in “One Gram Short” whose attempts to buy cannabis are frustrated because war in Syria has shut down his dealer’s supply route through Lebanon.When Keret does address political questions, he does so from an oblique angle. Where older Israeli writers such as Amos Oz and David Grossman have railed like prophets against their nation’s sins, Keret mounts his protest in the form of pitch-black satire. “Tabula Rasa” depicts an institution where children are bred as clones of wrongdoers. One boy is a copy of Hitler, raised so that a Holocaust survivor can take revenge by killing him but the boy doesn’t know he’s Hitler and simply longs to be free. There’s no mention of the Palestinians in the story – or in this collection – but the absurdity of punishing one group of people for the suffering of another is powerfully evoked.Although the tales are ided between five translators (Sondra Silverston, Nathan Englander, Jessica Cohen, Miriam Shlesinger and Yardenne Green), each captures Keret’s dry, almost clinical style superbly. The book shows a master of the short story pushing against the limits of what the form can achieve. In “Todd” a man goes to his friend, an author very much like Etgar Keret, with an unusual request: “You’ve already written stories that make girls cry … And ones that make them laugh. So now write one that’ll make them jump into bed with me.” The author protests that it doesn’t work like that: “A story isn’t a magic spell or hypnotherapy a story is just a way to share with other people something you feel, something intimate.” But you can see why, of all writers, the man came to this one. There’s only one thing Keret is incapable of doing with a story: writing one that’s boring.• Fly Already is published by Granta (£12.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

A really strong theme running through the book is the links between it and the crisis of rising white supremacy, the various forms of nationalism and the fact that so many people are being forced from their homelands, and the war that is waged on our attention s. These are intersecting and interconnecting crises and so the solutions have to be as well.Do you feel encouraged by talk of the Green New Deal?I feel a tremendous excitement and a sense of relief, that we are finally talking about solutions on the scale of the crisis we face. That we’re not talking about a little carbon tax or a cap and trade scheme as a silver bullet. We’re talking about transforming our economy. This system is failing the majority of people anyway, which is why we’re in this period of such profound political destabilisation – that is giving us the Trumps and the Brexits, and all of these strongman leaders – so why don’t we figure out how to change everything from bottom to top, and do it in a way that addresses all of these other crises at the same time? There is every chance we will miss the mark, but every fraction of a degree warming that we are able to hold off is a victory and every policy that we are able to win that makes our societies more humane, the more we will weather the inevitable shocks and storms to come without slipping into barbarism. Because what really terrifies me is what we are seeing at our borders in Europe and North America and Australia – I don’t think it’s coincidental that the settler colonial states and the countries that are the engines of that colonialism are at the forefront of this. We are seeing the beginnings of the era of climate barbarism. We saw it in Christchurch, we saw it in El Paso, where you have this marrying of white supremacist violence with vicious anti-immigrant racism.That is one of the most chilling sections of your book: I think that’s a link a lot of people haven’t made.This pattern has been clear for a while. White supremacy emerged not just because people felt like thinking up ideas that were going to get a lot of people killed but because it was useful to protect barbaric but highly profitable actions. The age of scientific racism begins alongside the transatlantic slave trade, it is a rationale for that brutality. If we are going to respond to climate change by fortressing our borders, then of course the theories that would justify that, that create these hierarchies of humanity, will come surging back. There have been signs of that for years, but it is getting harder to deny because you have killers who are screaming it from the rooftops.One criticism you hear about the environment movement is that it is dominated by white people. How do you address that?When you have a movement that is overwhelmingly representative of the most privileged sector of society then the approach is going to be much more fearful of change, because people who have a lot to lose tend to be more fearful of change, whereas people who have a lot to gain will tend to fight harder for it. That’s the big benefit of having an approach to climate change that links it to those so called bread and butter issues: how are we going to get better paid jobs, affordable housing, a way for people to take care of their families? I have had many conversations with environmentalists over the years where they seem really to believe that by linking fighting climate change with fighting poverty, or fighting for racial justice, it’s going to make the fight harder. We have to get out of this “my crisis is bigger than your crisis: first we save the planet and then we fight poverty and racism, and violence against women”. That doesn’t work. That alienates the people who would fight hardest for change. This debate has shifted a huge amount in the US because of the leadership of the climate justice movement and because it is congresswomen of colour who are championing the Green New Deal. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib come from communities that have gotten such a raw deal under the years of neoliberalism and longer, and are determined to represent, truly represent, the interests of those communities. They’re not afraid of deep change because their communities desperately need it.In the book, you write: “The hard truth is that the answer to the question ‘What can I, as an inidual, do to stop climate change?’ is: nothing.” Do you still believe that?In terms of the carbon, the inidual decisions that we make are not going to add up to anything like the kind of scale of change that we need. And I do believe that the fact that for so many people it’s so much more comfortable to talk about our own personal consumption, than to talk about systemic change, is a product of neoliberalism, that we have been trained to see ourselves as consumers first. To me that’s the benefit of bringing up these historical analogies, like the New Deal or the Marshall Plan – it brings our minds back to a time when we were able to think of change on that scale. Because we’ve been trained to think very small. It is incredibly significant that Greta Thunberg has turned her life into a living emergency.Yes, she set sail for the UN climate summit in New York on a zero carbon yacht ...Exactly. But this isn’t about what Greta is doing as an inidual. It’s about what Greta is broadcasting in the choices that she makes as an activist, and I absolutely respect that. I think it’s magnificent. She is using the power that she has to broadcast that this is an emergency, and trying to inspire politicians to treat it as an emergency. I don’t think anybody is exempt from scrutinising their own decisions and behaviours but I think it is possible to overemphasise the inidual choices. I have made a choice – and this has been true since I wrote No Logo, and I started getting these “what should I buy, where should I shop, what are the ethical clothes?” questions. My answer continues to be that I am not a lifestyle adviser, I am not anyone’s shopping guru, and I make these decisions in my own life but I’m under no illusion that these decisions are going to make the difference.Some people are choosing to go on birth strikes. What do you think about that?I’m happy these discussions are coming into the public domain as opposed to being furtive issues we’re afraid to talk about. It’s been very isolating for people. It certainly was for me. One of the reasons I waited as long as I did to try and get pregnant, and I would say this to my partner all the time – what, you want to have a Mad Max water warrior fighting with their friends for food and water? It wasn’t until I was part of the climate justice movement and I could see a path forward that I could even imagine having a kid. But I would never tell anybody how to answer this most intimate of questions. As a feminist who knows the brutal history of forced sterilisation and the ways in which women’s bodies become battle zones when policymakers decide that they are going to try and control population, I think that the idea that there are regulatory solutions when it comes to whether or not to have kids is catastrophically ahistorical. We need to be struggling with our climate grief together and our climate fears together, through whatever decision we decide to make, but the discussion we need to have is how do we build a world so that those kids can have thriving, zero-carbon lives?Over the summer, you encouraged people to read Richard Powers’s novel, The Overstory. Why?It’s been incredibly important to me and I’m happy that so many people have written to me since. What Powers is writing about trees: that trees live in communities and are in communication, and plan and react together, and we’ve been completely wrong in the way we conceptualise them. It’s the same conversation we’re having about whether we are going to solve this as iniduals or whether we are going to save the collective organism. It’s also rare, in good fiction, to valorise activism, to treat it with real respect, failures and all, to acknowledge the heroism of the people who put their bodies on the line. I thought Powers did that in a really extraordinary way.What are you views on what Extinction Rebellion has achieved?One thing they have done so well is break us out of this classic campaign model we have been in for a long time, where you tell someone something scary, you ask them to click on something to do something about it, you skip out the whole phase where we need to grieve together and feel together and process what it is that we just saw. Because what I hear a lot from people is, ok, maybe those people back in the 1930s or 40s could organise neighbourhood by neighbourhood or workplace by workplace but we can’t. We believe we’ve been so downgraded as a species that we are incapable of that. The only thing that is going to change that belief is getting face to face, in community, having experiences, off our screens, with one another on the streets and in nature, and winning some things and feeling that power.You talk about stamina in the book. How do you keep going? Do you feel hopeful?I have complicated feelings about the hope question. Not a day goes by that I don’t have a moment of sheer panic, raw terror, complete conviction that we are doomed, and then I do pull myself out of it. I’m renewed by this new generation that is so determined, so forceful. I’m inspired by the willingness to engage in electoral politics, because my generation, when we were in our 20s and 30s, there was so much suspicion around getting our hands dirty with electoral politics that we lost a lot of opportunities. What gives me the most hope right now is that we’ve finally got the vision for what we want instead, or at least the first rough draft of it. This is the first time this has happened in my lifetime. And also, I did decide to have kids. I have a seven year old who is so completely obsessed and in love with the natural world. When I think about him, after we’ve spent an entire summer talking about the role of salmon in feeding the forests where he was born in British Columbia, and how they are linked to the health of the trees and the soil and the bears and the orcas and this entire magnificent ecosystem, and I think about what it would be like to have to tell him that there are no more salmon, it kills me. So that motivates me. And slays me.• Naomi Klein will be in conversation with Katharine Viner at a  Live event on 15 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from people in the food industry about stockpiling ahead of potential food shortages and price rises in the event of a no-deal BrexitA no-deal Brexit could result in rising food prices and shortages of certain types of fresh food, according to secret documents the government was forced by MPs to publish on Wednesday.Ministers have refused to disclose details about their discussions with local authorities and the food industry over possible disruptions to food supplies, arguing that the information could damage negotiations with the EU.But the chief executive of the Co-op warned on Thursday that the convenience chain were likely to be low on fruits including apples and pears, which are imported during the winter, in the event of a no-deal scenario.We would like to speak to small business owners in the food industry – from greengrocers to restaurateurs – about what products they have begun stockpiling in case of extensive delays at the UK border.Are you a small business owner who is stockpiling ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit?

The British ships were no longer carrying fine muslins and calico to Europe. The primary produce brought over was jute, cotton, the sorts of materials used in the emerging British industrial project.”Priyamvada Gopal, who teaches at the faculty of English at Cambridge University, said that Britain’s history of commercial shipping was “a deeply violent one, which included shipping millions of black and indentured bodies tightly packed in the holds of ships to be exploited on plantations.”“It is shameful to not acknowledge this in favour of a diffuse and dishonest pride,” Gopal said.“It is a reflection of the pervasive ignorance that goes hand in hand with Empire nostalgia” Wagner said.A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “The slave trade was an abhorrent practice for which the British government has rightly apologised."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fed0198a7e629031eeca8dddacf797e111c0a981/0_91_5644_3386/master/5644.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c2f6538f4209a09d3374aa9dc3288a5","title":"meet the man behind sports directs upmarket rebrand","story":"Mike Ashley’s future son-in-law and head of elevation, Michael Murray, is busy reimagining the retail empireMen in sharp suits mix with models as Vogue editor Edward Enniful and fashion influencers sip champagne and Salty Dog cocktails while they peruse £525-a-pair bejewelled Jimmy Choo trainers at a glossy store on London’s Oxford Street.This is Flannels, the achingly expensive designer emporium which Mike Ashley, the founder and chief executive of Sports Direct, views as the future of his retail empire.Ashley himself is round the corner in the pub, sipping a pint. But working the floor is Michael Murray, Ashley’s future son-in-law, who the billionaire has made clear is in charge of turning his retail empire from pile-it-high joggers and hoodies to high-end brands and glitzy stores.Murray, Sports Direct’s “head of elevation” who celebrated his 30th birthday on Friday, says he has hardly slept for two weeks after opening a flagship project in Leicester – which turned a former BHS shop into a Flannels, a USC store and a Sports Direct – and the London designer store.“It has been pretty hectic and doesn’t look like slowing down any time soon,” Murray says.The Doncaster-born son of a property developer began by helping Ashley with personal property deals a few years after meeting his daughter Anna on holiday in 2011.He is now Ashley’s righthand man overseeing the revamp of Sports Direct stores as well as expanding Flannels, improving the group’s use of technology and building relationships with high-end brands.Ashley is clearly impressed, though after 37 years running Sports Direct it is clear he is not at home in the world of £800 Gucci trainers and £1,250 Moncler coats.At Sports Direct’s annual meeting in London on Wednesday, Ashley told shareholders not to buy anything in the Flannels store downstairs from the meeting room. “It’s eye-watering what some of the prices are for a pair of shoes or a cap,” he said.But he does understand the numbers. He describes the elevation strategy as “a golden ticket” and says he would like to have 100 stores like the new Leicester outlet. “I would like to click my fingers and have 100 Leicesters tomorrow … God do they take some money,” he said.Murray says his payout is “a very fair deal for Sports Direct”. He adds: “It is up to the non-executives what I get paid. I don’t take a salary and there are no guarantees. I get paid based on property performance and everything else is technically thrown in.“I oversee the future direction of the business and how stores look and what brands we should and shouldn’t be stocking.”The old guard may have concerns at Murray’s heavy involvement in operations directed from the £108m Oxford Street building, which now includes a new London head office for the group and a new team and culture that is very different from that at the group’s warehouse and main office in Shirebrook, Derbyshire.The group is moving further away from its roots with risky acquisitions including House of Fraser, which is losing more than £1m a week, and Jack Wills, the loss-making preppy brand. In July, the group admitted it could not put a figure on its future profitability as a result of the disastrous £90m buyout of the House of Fraser chain. It recently shocked investors with the revelation of a €674m (£600m) tax bill from the Belgian authorities.While those that know him say Murray is bright and likeable, he is viewed as inexperienced by the old guard and part of a new, less cost-conscious culture at the business where once executives stayed in the Premier Inn and took budget airline flights. Long-standing former lieutenants who helped build Sports Direct, including finance director Jon Kempster and Byers, have now departed.There are also rumblings over Murray’s influence over Ashley, who has clearly been very impressed with the strong performance of Flannels and improved Sports Direct stores which the younger man has overseen. “He clearly has Mike’s ear,” said one source who knows the company well, suggesting the pair thrash out business deals over drinks or dinner or on family holidays away from the wider management team. “He’s paying fortunes to someone unproven,” says another source close to the company.Murray says his role is clearly defined.“I’m thinking about the next 10 to 20 years. Me and Mike are working like a partnership. He looks after the back end – systems, logistics – I look after customer-facing side and the image of the business.”That image does have its problems, he admits. Sports Direct has what he refers to as “hindrances” from its historic reputation, a reference to when  reporters went undercover at the Sports Direct warehouse and discovered workers being underpaid and working in poor conditions: “It does definitely come with issues but you can’t have it all. In a couple of years time that will all be in the past.”Asked if he’d like to run the whole show one day, Murray say it’s not his decision. But he says: “The business is rapidly transforming.

Tuesday found him in a primary school, as per the timeworn political practice of ministers using inappropriate venues as backdrops. You know the sort of thing: “It’s great to come to this wonderful early years centre and announce 10 new active nuclear warheads, each capable of snuffing out 300,000 human futures in an instant.”Wow. Look, I know Prime Ministers Say the Darnedest Things. But maybe the best way to stop no deal is to put a call in to Oxford and explain they need to retroactively award Johnson a first-class degree? Just claim there was a marking error or something. Having read the Yellowhammer documents forecasting shortages, pretty much any gambit is justifiable at this point in the interests of public safety. Giving the prime minister a belated first would just be the classics department version of a cop shouting at Raoul Moat: “It’s fine, mate! I know you didn’t mean to hurt her! Nobody’s going back to prison. Just put the gun down and we can talk.”And so to another week in getting everything you always wanted. Johnson began with a horror show in the House of Commons, where his election offer to Jeremy Corbyn amounts to “Give me another series, you shit.” At least by glowering on the front bench and shaking his jowls and shouting, “Oh yes!” at Corbyn, Boris Johnson finally resembled Churchill. Unfortunately, the insurance dog version.He ended the week even more clumsily, after some Downing Street genius let it be known that the DUP had shifted their red lines in a way that could lead to a deal. Have they? Not according to adorable DUP leader Arlene Foster, who denied it and declared ominously: “Anonymous sources lead to nonsense stories”, which sounds like the sort of coded message you might rasp down a telephone with a hanky over the receiver. Fair warning’s fair warning. As for whoever briefed this story, it’s all very well being the third hardest spad in No 10, and I’m sure Arlene will take your Call of Duty score into account when discussing the leak. But babe: you’re not really in the same weight ision as the DUP guys, even if you did both wear combat trousers in the 1990s.Others suspect that what will really be on offer when parliament returns is Meaningful Vote 4 – set to displace Jaws IV: The Revenge as the worst fourth iteration of a franchise ever. The latter at least gave us one of the great Michael Caine quotes. “I have never seen it,” said its leading man. “By all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific.”Keen to build something other than resentment himself, Johnson spent the rest of the week promising a hardware bonanza. As always when he runs out of road, he suggested a bridge, followed by a promise to “bring shipbuilding home” with five new frigates. Maybe he could send a frigate round to the courts to stop domestic violence survivors being cross-examined by their abusers? Because thanks to his rogue prorogue, the domestic abuse bill is now back to square one. The only upside to suspending parliament has been the social damage done to Jacob Rees-Mogg. Not two months ago, that appalling old Hyacinth Bucket swept into office issuing naff decrees on the minutiae of how to address envelopes. He has now committed the somewhat greater faux pas of bullshitting the Queen.That this is all set against a backdrop of an advertising blitz gives the UK the feel of a Paul Verhoeven satire set in the near dystopian future. There’s “GET READY FOR BREXIT”. There’s “BE ONE OF THE 20,000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS”. But my favourite is the Treasury campaign, where animated booze glasses trilled the news that: “Beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes will all be duty free for people travelling to the EU if we leave without a deal.” You might be reminded of those Conservative ads a few years back, which said the government was “cutting the bingo tax and beer duty, to help hardworking people do more of the things they enjoy”. Those ads had their critics, but I admire the consistency and the realism, as the Conservatives continue to promote the notion that alcoholism and gambling addiction represent the smart choices for anyone governed by them.In fact, these government-backed reminders to drink early and often fuel the same sense of deep optimism as that moment in the Chernobyl drama when the new recruit to the dogshooting unit turns up to the camp and sees endless stacked pallets of empty vodka bottles. When any government – Soviet or modern British – is pushing cheap booze on you, you’ve got to think you’ve landed on your feet. Haven’t you?The alternative view, I suppose, is that government-advised inebriation and respiratory disease feels the next logical step of the Brexit shambles. “Prorogation” and “justiciability” and “stymying” and “fiat” – no one’s really sure precisely what these words mean, other than they weren’t in the brochure for the sunlit uplands. Still, don’t put your hand up and ask questions. Just accept we’ve been billeted in the irradiated uplands, gripped by a strong sense that the instruction book to our country has been lost."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b757a07c5edca22eb543cb614d7dfddaffe8d94/0_252_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c471f94e66eb45a17bc64c976069d2e7","title":"last night proms woke classical music","story":"My composition premieres tonight. It’s a recognition that classical music needs more ersity, to make it meaningful for all of usIn recent years we seem to have reached peak wokeness, but not entirely for the right reasons. I first heard woke as an adjective from the US, alongside the rise of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. The term “stay woke” was used as an empowering slogan that encouraged people to be vigilant to the injustices in society, especially racism. But as the word grew in popularity, the licence to use it in any which way expanded and its meaning became diluted. It was in response to this woke-washing that I decided to call my piece for tonight’s Last Night of the Proms “Woke”.As a composer whose father is Eritrean, whose mother is Russian and who was born and raised in the UK, I have always embraced a mixed and erse outlook. With age I have begun to truly appreciate the richness of drawing inspiration from a variety of perspectives. Having three cultures at hand to quarry for ideas – a triptych of folklore, language and traditions – is much more fruitful than just one.My journey into music began with group recorder lessons at a state primary school. I then progressed to the violin – my dad had a dream of me playing the instrument. At my local Centre for Young Musicians I had my first proper encounter with contemporary classical music. After being spotted singing in a choir I was recruited to join the English National Opera children’s chorus, where I sang in La Bohème, Carmen, a Bolshoi Opera production of Boris Godunov and the premiere of Mark-Anthony Turnage’s The Silver Tassie. And so began my love for new music, so much so that when I obtained a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Music, I took up composition. I am always very thankful to those who encouraged and supported me along the way. I also remember feeling a sense of otherness – where were all the other black and minority-ethnic children? The realisation that classical music is an industry with a one-sided vista was something that didn’t sit well with me from an early age. I have heard many an argument as to why this might be the case – a popular notion is that western classical music is a European tradition, and therefore makes the current state of affairs acceptable. It doesn’t. Successful composers such as Chevalier de Saint-Georges and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor existed, yet their music remains in the shadows. Why? Those in the industry should promote ersity. By doing so they will make classical music meaningful for all and sow interest among future generations. When I was growing up, there were no words like woke. Instead, I remember vividly the tragic slaying of Stephen Lawrence and the phrase that was coined by the inquiry into his murder – institutional racism.And so for the Last Night of the Proms, my wish is for my piece to be taken as a musical call for greater empathy and a willingness to try something new – whether musically or culturally. We can all play a part in staying vigilant and woke.• Daniel Kidane is a classical composer. His composition Woke is to have its premiere at the Last Night of the Proms, Saturday 14 September"},{"url":null,"title":"100 best films movies of the 21st century","story":"Gangsters, superheroes, schoolkids, lovers, slaves, peasants, techies, Tenenbaums and freefalling astronauts – they’re all here in our countdown of cinema’s best movies since 2000by  Peter Bradshaw,  Cath Clarke,  Andrew Pulver and  Catherine ShoardQuentin Tarantino’s latest jaw-dropper bumps Kill Bill: Vol 1 off the list in gloriously irreverent fashion.

CS Read the reviewIsraeli soldier-turned-film-maker Ari Folman’s film is a kind of animated companion to Apocalypse Now, a hallucinatory statement about the trauma of conflict and the madness of war. It’s an autobiographical documentary, Folman interviewing the men he fought alongside, aged 19, in the first Lebanon war of 1982. He has repressed his memories of the time. The film’s climax is the massacre of Palestinian refugees by Christian Phalangists at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps. CC Read the reviewA sprawling drama that functions both as an excoriating treatise on the nature of poverty in Lebanon, and an idiosyncratic drama in which a child takes his parents to court for their ill-treatment of him. We tend to think of the latter type of juvenile emancipation as the province of overprivileged westerners, but director Nadine Labaki makes it work in the toughest of social circumstances: a 12-year-old, living in the Beirut slums, takes steps to deal with his parents’ neglect.

After that, it’s complicated, with a flight into magic realism or perhaps even reincarnation. CC Read the review’s Peter Bradshaw ranked The Incredibles as Pixar’s best ever film, the jewel in the crown. And only Pixar could make a superhero movie for kids about a midlife crisis.

A what-if feminist parable, this is a movie that thinks the unthinkable: what if a mother doesn’t like her child, or even love him? And the casting is killer, with Ezra Miller as Kevin and Tilda Swinton playing the mother. It’s a bruising watch, but Ramsay makes it’s impossible to turn away. CC Read the reviewMalian director Abderrahmane Sissako won a lot of admirers for this slow-burn study of life in a west African town. Returning to Mauritania, his country of birth, Sissako puts together a string of vignettes and encounters, linked together by a returning, westernised student who can barely remember the local language. AP Read the reviewJoanna Hogg’s belated international breakthrough is a story of extraordinary specificity – young Hogg has disastrous affair while living in Knightsbridge and studying as a film student in the early 1980s – with rare cut-through and relatability. Honor Swinton Byrne is astonishing in her first film Tom Burke inch-perfect as the charming but parasitic older man. CS Read the reviewSeth MacFarlane’s brief ascent to the Hollywood firmament was down to this scabrously funny talking-bear farce, which helped reinvent the grossout comedy. Mark Wahlberg is great as the straight man to the foul-mouthed toy of the title, with Mila Kunis as his censorious fiancee. MacFarlane’s creation was simultaneously endearing and outrageous. AP Read the reviewMammoth two-part Indian crime film that’s a long, long way from Bollywood. Directed by Anurag Kashyap, this is conceived on a giant scale, as generations of three gangster families fight for supremacy over the course of half a century. Stylish, visceral film-making, violent and hard-hitting, it’s got a valid claim to be India’s answer to The Godfather. AP Read the reviewAndrea Arnold tossed out the costume drama rulebook with her raw, passionate retelling of Emily Brontë’s novel. I’d argue the case for Wuthering Heights as one of the most criminally underrated movies of recent years – though it’s been influential, blazing a trail for stripped-back period movies such as Lady Macbeth. Arnold was an early adopter of inclusive casting, too, giving the role of Heathcliff to black actor James Howson. CC Read the reviewIt took Winter’s Bone’s Debra Granik eight years to get this off the ground, but was worth the wait: a brilliantly moving eco drama with Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie as a father and daughter living off grid in an Oregon forest, but whose relationship and priorities are changed as the child begins the transition to adulthood. AP Read the reviewRelegated to telly in the US, Steven Soderbergh’s wondrously funny and lavish Liberace biopic had a cinema release in the UK. Michael Douglas cast vanity aside and caution to the wind with virtuosic results as the promiscuous ivories-tickler Matt Damon was terrific against type as his lover, Rob Lowe pinched and uproarious as their much-employed cosmetic surgeon. CS Read the reviewGroundbreaking single-shot paean to the Winter Palace in St Petersburg from Russian director Alexander Sokurov. Exploiting then newly developed video technology, Sokurov crafted an elaborately choreographed procession of tableaux and set pieces that explored three centuries of Russian history and culture, from the imperial era to the wartime siege of Leningrad. AP Read the reviewAfter the Cambridge Analytica revelations, the treachery and backstabbery in Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher’s Facebook origin tale looks positively quaint – the geeks and nerds fighting over who had the idea for Facebook first. Nevertheless, this is still an outrageously watchable hatchet job. Jesse Eisenberg is a knockout Mark Zuckerberg, the smartest guy in the room (though not sartorially, in flip-flops and a hoodie). CC Read the reviewA beautifully shot observational documentary about the continuing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean: the lethally dangerous boats that carry refugees from Africa and end up on the Italian island of Lampedusa. Shot by director Gianfranco Rosi with an evocative lyricism that sits in counterpoint to the blazing anger at the film’s heart. AP Read the reviewA film that grabs you by the neck and shakes hard, this brutal crime drama announced the Mexican director Alejandro González Iñárritu as a major new talent in 2000. (And lumbered him for the while with the label “Mexico’s Tarantino”.) A film of mayhem and fury, three stories intersect around a car crash in which one of the passengers is a champion fighting dog. CC Read the reviewWestern audiences unfamiliar with the wuxia martial arts genre had never seen anything like Ang Lee’s dazzling 18th-century-set epic in 2000 – fighters flying through the air with balletic grace. In the most exhilarating scene, the daughter of a regional governor (Ziyi Zhang) goes sword-to-sword with a famous warrior (Chow Yun-fat) in the branches of bamboo trees swaying high above the ground. CC Read the reviewIn Richard Linklater’s gorgeous, romantic Before Sunrise, a pair of twentysomethings (Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke) spent the day together in Vienna. Here in the second movie when they meet again in Paris for another brief encounter, they are in their 30s. So the questions are for grownups. Am I with the right person? Where did my life go? It also has the best line ever about being in a couple with small children: “I feel like I’m running a small nursery with someone I used to date.” CC Read the reviewMichael Winterbottom and Steve Coogan’s truth-tickling hit a high note with this joyful sorta-biopic of the record label boss and broadcaster Tony Wilson. Playful, ingenious and prodigiously informative, it’s a triumph of vision over verite. It’s also a total blast. CS Read the reviewTerence Davies utilised Gillian Anderson’s poised elegance to good advantage in this brilliantly controlled adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel. Anderson plays Lily Bart, the woman whose reputation and standing are gradually sullied until she becomes an unmarriageable outcast in end of 19th-century America. AP Read the reviewHere’s another dark American tale from Manchester by the Sea writer-director Kenneth Lonergan (Margaret was completed in 2007 but only released in 2011 after a wrangle with the studio). Set in post 911 New York, Anna Paquin is an overentitled teenager partly responsible for a tragic accident. As in Manchester by the Sea, the effect is shattering it is like watching actual lives fall apart. CC Read the reviewArguably Penélope Cruz’s finest performance, in one of Pedro Almodóvar’s key films: a heady stew of murder, family strife and supernatural shenanigans. Cruz plays a woman forced to kill and bury her ex-husband, while her dead mother appears to be haunting her hairdresser sister. All is resolved after various traumas are lanced. AP Read the reviewIntense, anger-driven documentary from Ava DuVernay on the racialisation of the US’s justice system, positing the idea that the massively disproportionate incarceration of African-American men is simply slavery by another name. With a title referring to the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery, DuVernay suggests that privatised prisons, cheap labour and light-touch capitalism are all in it together. Tough stuff. AP Read the reviewA knockout blow for the lazy, patronising stereotype that Germans don’t have a sense of humour, Maren Ade’s Toni Erdmann is one of the funniest films to hit (arthouse) cinemas in years. It’s the story of a workaholic management consultant (Sandra Hüller) whose embarrassing dad turns up unannounced for the weekend wearing joke-shop false teeth. A genuine one-off, the film is partly a satire on Europe, globalisation and workplace misogyny, as well as being a prickly sweet father-daughter movie. CC Read the reviewPossibly the most fun anyone’s had at the cinema so far this century, Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street ought to be a cautionary tale. It’s based on the autobiography of crooked stockbroker Jordan Belfort, convicted in 1999 for fraud and money-laundering. But why focus on regret, when there are hookers, drugs and fast cars? Leonardo DiCaprio is outrageously entertaining as Belfort. CC Read the reviewThe film whose Palme d’Or win heralded the arrival of a new wave of Romanian cinema. A young woman, helped by her friend, arranges an illegal abortion in the late 80s the squalid events that follow parallel the decay and chaos of the country as the communist dictatorship began to collapse. Harrowing but clear-sighted. AP Read the reviewThe Handmaiden is one of cinema’s great literary adaptations: Park Chan-wook transposes Sarah Waters’s crime novel Fingersmith from Victorian London to Korea in the 1930s. In this most twisted of love stories, a pickpocket (Kim Tae-ri) poses as maid to a wealthy heiress (Kim Min-hee). But who is the double-crosser? Depending on your tastes, a candidate for sexiest film of the century. CC Read the reviewAt the age of 47, after a career directing TV soaps such as Casualty and EastEnders, Joanna Hogg reinvented herself as auteur of a new breed of cinema. In her feature debut, Unrelated, Kathryn Worth played a fortyish woman holidaying in Tuscany with two dysfunctional families and flirting outrageously with one of the lads (Tom Hiddleston in his first movie). A cinema of awkwardness, wielding a scalpel on the well-to-do middle classes, was born. CC Read the reviewKelly Reichardt is a master of slow cinema, the maker of films about American outsiders, living without a safety net. Meek’s Cutoff is a western set in 1840s Oregon, following three families on the wagon train west. Their leader is show-offy Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), but Reichardt’s focus, as is customary for her, is on the women – a trio played by Michelle Williams, Zoe Kazan and Shirley Henderson. CC Read the reviewHere’s a police procedural with a difference by the Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan – the whodunnit and why playing second fiddle to long stretches of silence. It’s set in rural Turkey where officials are spending the night driving a murder suspect around looking for a body. What they find, however, is mostly existential despair. Not exactly easy viewing, but it’s a masterpiece of slow cinema. CC Read the reviewLars von Trier’s Brechtian parable about coercive capitalism remains arguably the Danish provocateur’s masterpiece. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany both excel in this study of a woman on the run from gangsters who is offered shelter in a small town in return for undertaking chores. Von Trier’s use of stylised, floor-painted sets is the inspired final touch. AP Read the reviewThe film begins with a couple in front of a judge asking for a orce. She wants to leave Iran and take their daughter. He cannot go his elderly father is sick. Everyone behaves badly in Asghar Farhadi’s desperately painful family drama. Farhadi’s superpower is empathy, making the audience see all points of view. He lays depth charges in seemingly inconsequential moments with emotionally thrilling consequences. CC Read the reviewBritish director Andrew Haigh’s quietly devastating drama is a deeply moving portrait of marriage with the shiver of a ghost story. Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay play a Norfolk couple planning their 45th wedding anniversary. A week before the party, a letter lands on their doormat like a hand grenade with news of his early lost love. Rampling is sensational. CC Read the reviewThe Dardenne brothers’ second Palme d’Or was bestowed on this stark portrait of underclass desperation, filmed in their characteristic hyper-naturalist manner. Jérémie Renier plays a petty criminal who sells his newborn baby in the adoption black market, but his devastated girlfriend’s response forces a kind of redemption. AP Read the reviewProbably most Wes Anderson-y of Wes Anderson’s films and certainly his finest, with a to-die-for cast and the best fur coat in the history of cinema. Gwyneth Paltrow, Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller are the Tenenbaum siblings, all former child prodigies. The brilliance has faded. Who’s to blame? Enter paterfamilias Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman), a man who consoles his grieving grandsons with: “I’m sorry for your loss. Your mother was a terribly attractive woman.” CC Read the reviewIf we are living through a golden age of space movies, here’s where it started, Alfonso Cuarón’s spectacular thriller, shot with unbearable tension and Discovery Channel realism. Sandra Bullock is the rookie astronaut with George Clooney by her side, a living, breathing Buzz Lightyear. When a storm of debris hits the pair, a terrifying fight for survival ensues. Astoundingly good. CC Read the reviewCharlie Kaufman’s existential breakdown with stop-motion puppets is a miniature masterpiece of concept and execution. David Thewlis voices the depressed motivational speaker to whom everyone sounds the same – except for Jennifer Jason Leigh’s scarred sales agent. “What is it to be human?” asks Michael Stone (Thewlis). “To ache?” Few films try to answer: this Fabergé egg of a film does. CS Read the reviewThe hardest-drinking movie on our list - with some stiff competition - Andrey Zvyagintsev’s anti-Putin polemic is brilliant, ballsy and completely sozzled. Our hero fisherman is forced from his home so that the corrupt local mayor can build his own palace on the site. A priest speaks of “reawakening the soul of the Russian people” as their spirits lie crushed at his feet. Corruption is so endemic, these people have even lost God. This is the most almighty achievement. CS Read the reviewBruce Dern discards his marbles on a windmill-tilting road trip with loving but frustrated son Will Forte. Alexander Payne’s black-and-white ode to small-town America is his best this century (Sideways has not aged like a fine wine). It also features June Squibb being completely filthy. CS Read the reviewTerrence Malick’s return to cinema six years after The New World has been vaguely tainted by the slew of woozy filmic xeroxes that have followed, but his first comeback – in which Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain stand in for his parents in 1950s Texas – is a choking knockout. CS Read the reviewJust nudging Gene Hackman’s Tenenbaum clan down the list, Wes Anderson’s glorious 1930s confection is a delight with a hard nugget of politics at its core. Ralph Fiennes’s central turn as charming concierge M Gustave, all beneficent sex and abashed camp, remains the man’s finest hour. CS Read the reviewEdward Yang’s final film is a delicate domestic miracle: the story of one family seen through the perspectives of the father, the son and the daughter. A wedding begins proceedings, a funeral ends them. The stuff in the middle is the everyday, dissected with rare beauty and gravity. CS Read the reviewJordan Peele’s debut is a perfect, hard-polished gem of a film. A race satire that skewers beautifully, it’s also a chilling comedy, a proper horror and 104 minutes of complete entertainment. CS Read the reviewBrief as a dream and just as devastating, Paweł Pawlikowski’s black and white story of a novice nun on a road trip with her aunt in 1962 Poland to discover the fate of her Jewish parents is spare, shocking and utterly unforgettable. CS Read the reviewStill Sacha Baron Cohen’s finest moment, a feature-length upscaling of his ludicrously hilarious TV character, whose purpose is to sucker the unsuspecting into condemning themselves out of their own mouths. Borat is on a trip in the US to try to marry Pamela Anderson not everything works, but when it does it’s astounding: cruelly revelatory and hysterically funny at the same time. AP Read the reviewHayao Miyazaki’s wondrous animation, the greatest success of a spectacular run from Japan’s Studio Ghibli. A gentle, mysterious fable about a 10-year-old girl whose family stumble upon a haunted bathhouse After her parents are turned into pigs, she works to lift the curse, encountering a variety of spirit-world beings along the way. AP Read the reviewMichael Haneke won his first Palme d’Or with this chilling, steel-hard parable set in Germany just before the first world war. The inhabitants of a small village are dogged by mysterious, violent incidents that serve mostly to exacerbate the dysfunctional social codes they all live by – and elliptically suggests the moral climate that evolved into Nazism. AP Read the reviewDespite lingering controversy over its adoption by Netflix in its war with the film industry, Roma still stands as an absolutely major work. Mexican auteur Alfonso Cuarón returned to the Mexico City of his childhood, telling the story of a middle-class family and their nanny-cum-maid in swooning, lyrical black and white. Part memoir, part elegaic fiction, Cuaron hit the heights with this. AP Read the reviewSteven Spielberg’s portrait of the great US president looked at the time like a history lesson come to life: graced by a monumental, Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, it detailed the arm-twisting and chicanery behind the passing of his slave-freeing constitutional amendment. These days, it looks like a fantasy: a president with principles: who’d have thought? AP Read the reviewThe Coen brothers don’t really do personal, but this is as close as they’ve got (so far). Set in their home town of Minneapolis in the late 60s, A Serious Man stars Michael Stuhlbarg as an academic whose life is roiled by continuing uncertainty and self-doubt – triggering repeat visits to his rabbis, a marriage breakdown and extended interactions with his oddball brother. AP Read the reviewThe Young Pope director Paolo Sorrentino crafted this swooningly beautiful love letter to Rome – “la grande bellezza” – in its decadent, jaded glory. Toni Servillo, Sorrentino’s regular onscreen foil, plays journalist Jep Gambardella, a bon viveur beginning to sense the dying of his personal light, and hunting out meaning and substance in the world around him. AP Read the reviewAn extraordinary documentary about the wave of barbaric killings that swept Indonesia in the mid-60s. Orchestrated by director Joshua Oppenheimer, this film revisits the perpetrators of some horrific events and asks them – with little need for encouragement – to re-enact them. The result is almost unwatchable: the murderers’ glee at performing, and the remorse they may or may not experience as a result. AP Read the reviewJapanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda won the Palme d’Or for this exquisitely turned drama that – like much of Kore-eda’s previous output – explores what it is to be a family in entirely non-conventional circumstances. A shoplifting gang take in a young girl who seems abandoned how they hang together – or not – is the film’s key theme. AP Read the reviewOne of Isabelle Huppert’s finest performances, and that’s saying something. Director Claire Denis drew on her own upbringing in colonial west Africa to give this study of a hard-as-nails plantation owner a pungent whiff of authenticity. Huppert is Maria, obsessed with getting in the coffee harvest as a violent civil conflict moves ever closer. Saddled with an untrustworthy husband and an erratic son, it’s all she can do to survive. AP Read the reviewFrom director Todd Haynes, this is pastiche at its most brilliantly acute. Haynes takes the bold, vivid melodrama beloved of Douglas Sirk, and reconfigures it to fully reveal the social faultlines of race, sex and class that were considerably more latent in the original. A beautifully crafted act of ancestor worship. AP Read the reviewBrutally visceral fable that plunges the viewer headlong into the all-encompassing horror of a Nazi extermination camp. Shot in remorseless, unforgiving close-up by first time Hungarian director László Nemes, the story of a Jewish prison-camp worker whose job it is to help clear the gas chamber of corpses is cinema at its absolute rawest. AP Read the reviewA magisterial achievement from David Lynch, despite the difficulties he had getting it off the ground. Originally conceived as the pilot of a new TV series, this expertly fuses Lynch’s softcore pulp obsessions with his trademark creepy surrealism. Naomi Watts was the big discovery here: she plays a wannabe actor who midway seems to switch personalities with another, more jaded one. AP Read the reviewThe most audacious slaughter of sacred cows seen on celluloid, Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s marionette action-musical is a gleeful hail of precision-aimed bullets. It’s totally fearless: pops are taken at Hollywood, Broadway, evil dictators, gung-ho superpowers, the intelligence service, bleeding heart liberals, actors – especially actors – before signing off with a devastating, if obscene, defence of US interventionism. Politically, it’s scattergun satirically, it’s spot-on. Mostly, though, it’s just ferociously funny, even if most of the humour does, finally, come from the sight of the 2ft puppets tottering around, getting drunk, having wild sex, attempting to walk through doorways and wrestling panthers played by kittens. CS Read the reviewAn official working for the Spanish crown descends into madness while waiting for a transfer out of his backwater post in 18th-century Paraguay in Lucrecia Martel’s fevered historical drama. Like a disorienting dream, it’s a film of fragments, moments that worm their way into your memory – a slave limping with flayed feet, a llama barging into frame during an uncomfortable meeting. Daniel Giménez Cacho is petty, wretched Zama, clinging to his white man’s sense of importance (and his ill-fitting periwig), a symptom of colonial rot. Martel has been called “the Malick of Latin American cinema” but this feels closer to Herzog. A strange masterpiece. CC Read the reviewThe triumph of Barry Jenkins’s coming-of-age tale over La La Land for the best picture Oscar was extraordinary in all sorts of ways, of which Faye Dunaway’s envelope mixup was maybe the least remarkable. It was the first film with an all-black cast as well as with an LGBTQ theme to scoop the prize – and it must also rank as one of the most visually and tonally ambitious: told in three parts, with three different leads, each showing the stages of repression and internalised loathing in the young life of a Miami man. It’s simply revelatory: innovative, wildly affecting, utterly beautiful. CS Read the reviewAfter a string of brilliant, industry-transforming scripts, Charlie Kaufman made his directorial debut with this complex, convoluted drama, starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as theatre director Caden Cotard, who is swamped by personal crises as he works on his dream project: building an ever-expanding replica of the city streets and buildings inside a giant warehouse, and populating it with lookalikes the blurred boundary between performance and reality is mirrored in Cotard’s own breakdown, with the title giving the big clue – this is all symbolic. AP Read the reviewHaving made his name as one of the pioneers of ordeal arthouse with unflinching chronicles of trauma and cruelty, Austrian auteur Michael Haneke achieved a unlikely popular success with this film that connected with France’s deep well of unease about events of the relatively recent past. Daniel Auteuil plays a successful TV host whose contentment is disturbed by the arrival of mysterious surveillance tapes. This seems to be connected with a young Algerian boy whose parents were apparently killed in the infamous 1961 Paris massacre. Haneke ratchets up the tension with an unerring sense of dread and dismay. AP Read the reviewHas there ever been a more beautiful couple in the history of cinema than Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung in Wong Kar-Wai’s smouldering love story In the Mood for Love? Not that they’re a couple, technically. It’s 1962. Chow (Tony Leung) and Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in next door to each other in a cramped Hong Kong block of flats. His wife is having an affair – with her husband. The cheated-on pair become friends, but vow not to behave badly. Like Brief Encounter, the film aches with the understanding that impossible love makes for a more romantic movie. It’s gorgeously detailed, drenched in sensuality – a scene in which the two squeeze past each other in a narrow alleyway by night has a humid sexiness. CC Read the reviewJonathan Glazer’s first film in nearly a decade (and still his most recent) turned out to be an uncategorisable masterwork. Scarlett Johansson plays an alien in human form, trawling the streets of Glasgow for unsuspecting males to “take home” – in fact, using them as a food source. From its unnerving alien-POV sequences, to the empathetic scene with actor Adam Pearson (who has neurofibromatosis), to the sheer coldness of the predatory logic of its central figure, Under the Skin achieves a mood and texture unlike anything else before or since. AP Read the reviewTwelve years in the shooting, Richard Linklater’s story of a child’s life between six and 18 is a vindication of artistic ambition in an age of cinematic snacking. Its downside is to ruin almost every single other film for you – at least all those in which the actors are conspicuously aged up or down. In watching the bonafide progress of Ellar Coltrane – as well as Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke as his parents – Boyhood provides its audience with an intimacy and an investment like no other. This is cinema as gentle revolution. CS Read the reviewSteve McQueen’s real-life story of Solomon Northup, a free man kidnapped and sold into slavery in 19th-century Louisiana, exudes all of the dignity, impatience and artistic fidelity of its director. It is perfectly cast and paced, endlessly surprising, uncompromising and compassionate: a story purely and powefully told, yet full of the extraordinary visual grace notes. It never descends into cliche or even self-pity it remains a film for adults, uninterested in anything but the truth. To read Northup’s 1853 memoir is to be astonished by the film’s fidelity. CS Read the reviewPaul Thomas Anderson’s strange masterpiece, freely adapted by him from Upton Sinclair’s 1927 novel Oil!, has a dark title that threatens a calamity now visible on the horizon: destruction of the Earth itself. And it is all inscribed in the story of the movie’s leading character, a man with the Bunyanesque name of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Day-Lewis gives perhaps the greatest, certainly the most exotic performance of his career as an oil prospector in the early 20th century, rewarded with colossal wealth that never gives him the smallest pleasure.The movie perhaps looks even stranger, starker and more unforgiving now than it did in 2007 when it first came out. But from 2016, there has been a raging Plainview in plain sight in the White House: Trump, the eccentric property billionaire and spoilt baby whose cranky tweets are as crazy as Plainview’s deranged “milkshake” pronouncement. What a spectacle Anderson and Day-Lewis create: a portrait of male belligerence and fear, a Tutankhamun of misery, walled up in his own sarcophagus of wealth and prestige.

Don’t. Want. To. Do. This.’ And then the next thing I know, I was eating it and … ” Here, McCarthy, a Saturday Night Live regular and veteran of several blockbuster comedies, pauses before the punchline lands: “ … it was awful!”Haddish shakes her head sadly: “I tried to share with y’all poor people food, but you … it’s all good.“You didn’t grow up in the hood, though.”Mercifully, perhaps, neither this culinary experiment nor any others are featured in The Kitchen. Instead, the title of their new film is taken from the DC comic-book series on which it’s based. It refers both to Hell’s Kitchen, the traditionally Irish neighbourhood of Manhattan where their characters run a protection racket after their gangster husbands are sent to prison, and also to the 1970s domestic servitude that all the men seem to wish they would scuttle back to. No chance, pal.“I think that this specific story was my story to tell,” said director Andrea Berloff firmly when we spoke earlier that day. Berloff has been working steadily as a screenwriter since 2006’s World Trade Center, picking up an Oscar nomination for the 2015 NWA biopic Straight Outta Compton, and was originally hired to adapt The Kitchen for the screen. This time, though, she put herself forward to direct as well.Now Berloff says she is determined to direct her next script, too, but will she get the chance? A few days after we meet, The Kitchen goes on general release in the US and – fairly predictably, for anyone familiar with the ways of Hollywood – it is poorly reviewed. Subsequently, industry paper Variety publishes a piece analysing the film’s disappointing box office, in which a Warner Bros exec is quoted saying: “In the case of this story, we took bold choices that didn’t pan out for us.” It is hard not to read this as a signal that it’s back to male-dominated business as usual.Moss, 37, Haddish, 39, and McCarthy, 49, are three actors all at the peak of their powers, and all very different. Moss is a sunny-natured, self-described “Valley girl” who’s been in the biz since childhood and has the Scientology levels to prove it. Fame is much fresher for Haddish, who spent much of her childhood on the other side of LA, in South Central foster homes, before parlaying a social worker’s suggestion into a superstar standup career. She’s now busily shooting “about 19” movies back to back, like someone who well understands how short-lived the good times can be. McCarthy is a little older, a little calmer an Illinois farm girl-turned-savvy film-maker who co-produces many of her own blockbuster comedies with her husband of 14 years, Ben Falcone, and regularly appears in Top 10 lists of Hollywood’s best-paid actresses. Last year, she added a best actress Oscar nomination to her achievements.What the three share is a popular appeal that is rooted in talent and not weighted towards looks. That would be an impressive feat for any screen actor, but it is particularly so for women in Hollywood. As McCarthy’s character Kathy tells her children in one memorable scene from The Kitchen: “Pretty doesn’t matter it’s just a tool women can use.”This take-it-or-leave-it attitude to the male gaze seems to make them all particularly beloved by female audiences. McCarthy and Haddish began their current winning streaks with Bridesmaids (2011) and Girls Trip (2017), respectively, two female-fronted comedies that were said to usher in a new era by proving the box-office bankability of women. Moss’s feminist credentials, meanwhile, rest on her lead role in The Handmaid’s Tale and, before that, playing career gal Peggy Olson in Mad Men. Despite that, a high proportion of those were created and directed by men.Speaking of collaboration, do they reckon they’ve got what it takes to run a protection racket? Haddish answers without hesitation: “Hell, yeah!” And you believe her too no one could survive the ordeals outlined in her 2017 memoir, The Last Black Unicorn, without learning how to take control of a situation. Moss mulls it over more earnestly: “Ah … noooo. Probably not. I think I’d … nah … Well? Definitely not with the killing.” While McCarthy offers up the most “midwestern mom” take imaginable: “Like I’ve said before with my kids, I think embarrassment goes a long way. I don’t want to kill anybody but if it’s like, you show up and just embarrass the bejesus out of someone? I tell you what, they’re only gonna have that happen a coupla times … ”There are also some great male character actors involved, including Domhnall Gleeson, Common and Bill Camp, and Berloff insists that it’s “absolutely” a story made for men, too. “Well, listen, I genuinely believe that women have been going to see male-driven movies for a hundred years and that there’s no reason men can’t sit in a theatre and watch amazing actresses do their work.”Like the proverbial Kool-Aid-coated pickle, then, The Kitchen clearly is not going to be to everyone’s taste, but that’s exactly why it’s important to give it a try when offered. What does it say about us if we’re not even willing to do that?The Kitchen is in cinemas from Friday 20 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab3c622cd139eae622faaf92ab3a0632f109db93/0_187_5612_3367/master/5612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0d3dd1411c75170fdb1dd62c9f1d29d","title":"westminster unravels losing yourself worst films 2019","story":"As everything becomes incendiary, all news confusing, all social media polarised, I have spent long periods in my local multiplexAt the 11am screening of A Million Little Pieces at the Vue multiplex, which I slunk into to hide from a parliamentary coup, I arrived to find the 272-seat cinema entirely empty. It was a little spooky, but I stayed. Just me, eating popcorn, enjoying Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s penis while Britain burns.I’ve spent a lot of time hiding in this gargantuan 20-screen cinema on the top floor of a shopping centre through the summer of 2019. Finally, I understand the meaning of the safe space. I love the crisp air-con and pure anonymity. The snacks are atrocious, the staff sullenly dehumanising, and the tickets, all day every day, are a penny short of seven quid.As everything about Brexit has become incendiary, all news items confusing, all social media feeds angrily polarised, making the miners’ dispute look like a period of warm societal cohesion by comparison, I have spent long periods in the dark. “Well, you’ll be first against the wall,” several of you may be presently thinking, “you whining, fascist Marie-Antoinette bint!” Well, quite.But at the multiplex, there is none of this anger. (I cannot vouch for rage levels at my local art-house independent, where entry is at least £17 and an earnest film student will ferry a bespoke organic fudge sundae to your seat as you watch weighty Oscar 2020 contenders such as Parasite or The Souvenir.) It’s the blockbusters that provide a refuge. As Spinal Tap’s Nigel Tufnel says on his tour of Graceland: “Well, it really puts perspective on things, though, doesn’t it?”Perhaps like me, right now, you do not have the bandwidth for perspective. Perhaps you are instead in the mood to see if Jason Statham can win a ninja battle against 12 assassins, accompanied by a score of Tha Movement \u0026amp Anonymouz ft Poetik and MC Arme. Fast \u0026amp Furious: Hobbs \u0026amp Shaw ticks this box.What else? The Queen’s Corgi was a Belgian-animated pile of dog mess-scented will-this-do gubbins which left me feeling dizzy but it stopped me worrying about whether I should stockpile groceries, medication and water. Or whether even thinking that is the hallmark of a hysteric? Or whether, if the worst happens, I will brave starvation-related civil unrest by just killing a lot of people as Gerard Butler does in the atrocious (ergo amazing) third part of the Lidl Jason Bourne franchise that is Angel Has Fallen?Midsommar, a horror film loosely depicting what happens if one takes mushrooms and gets lost in the Petersham Nurseries garden centre, positioned itself as a clever movie, but was actually soothingly daft. The Current War with Benedict Cumberbatch was 108 minutes of men in top hats bickering about lightbulbs, but also a good chance to hide while the nation came to terms with the word “prorogue”.Likewise Rocketman, in which Taron Egerton batters nonstop through Elton John hits, the perfect pick-me-up after I observed a mass social-media-blocking spree between friends, which started out about Brexit but slid into trans rights in the Trumpian era and concluded with a call to arms from both sides. Clearly neither side would be committing violence themselves they merely suggested that if someone bigger and harder punched a Brexiter, a Terf, a Nazi, a misogynist or a remoaner, well, it would only be understandable.Alas, all good things cannot last. Summer is over. The race to win prestigious trophies has begun. Film distributors will stop quietly pushing out stinkers that they were contractually obliged to show, instead unveiling the big guns. Here comes The Goldfinch, the adaptation of the epic Donna Tartt novel Joker, with Joaquin Phoenix, about a standup comedian who turns psychopath Judy, about Judy Garland, set to be one of the roles of Renée Zellweger’s life. The forthcoming Bombshell stars Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and Margot Robbie, and is about sexual harassment and Fox News. These are films one will be required to have a strident view on. What’s more, as the 92nd Academy Awards look set to be more political than ever, Hollywood will try to show that it really cares about climate change, gun control, #MeToo and a dozen other pressing issues through various sombre outfits and angry speeches.Stars should be able to use their celebrity to make important points but for me, Oscars season is anything but an escape. I am awarding my summer 2019 prize for acting to Taylor-Johnson’s member. It stole the entire movie. We live in interesting times, surrounded by idiots.

Today’s recipe is particularly aromatic: a cheat’s croissant made with pre-rolled puff-pastry filled with a push-of-a-button pistachio marzipan and sweet cherries. So few ingredients and little work for such lovely smells and so much joy … you may as well fling open the windows (and pass a plate around).You can use frozen cherries, if you like – just defrost them fully first.

I’ve received no medical support from the women’s team Crystal Palace kindly funded my initial scan.

I’ve been left in limbo.”A statement from Crystal Palace Women said: “Gemma remained fully paid, beyond the terms of her agreement, until the end of the season when her registration expired. She was also offered ongoing continued access to rehabilitation support beyond the end of last season.”The club have also disputed the validity of Bryan’s claim that another player, believed to be Ashlee Hincks who suffered an ACL injury last week, has received preferential treatment: “Gemma’s claim that another player with a similar injury has received different levels of treatment and support is factually incorrect.”The issues raised by Bryan have stirred up longstanding frustrations over player welfare. The FA introduced new rules that require Women’s Super League clubs to provide private medical insurance for players.

The reality is that managers, players, coaching staff – sometimes they have one year left and they are happy others need a different challenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7db94e37ab4f48265e8063dcf8622fe2a37deac2/8_0_2544_1526/master/2544.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f0df1aea8f49f9a5c04143816e95dd0","title":"cristiano ronaldo superstar era international record","story":"Cristiano Ronaldo has Ali Daei’s unheralded milestone in sight, which would suitably crown a unique type of brillianceFamously, the North Korean leader Kim Jong-il only ever played one game of golf. In 1994 state media reported Kim had picked up a club for the first time at the country’s only golf course. Happily he took to the sport instantly, completing his debut round in a world-record 38 under par with 11 holes in one. At which point he announced he was retiring from golf and would never play again.It is of course a terrible blow for golf to lose such a talent, and tantalising to imagine just how good the Supreme Commander Of The People’s Army could have become. Worse, there is no recording of the round, just the sworn testimony of his 17 bodyguards that it definitely, like, happened. Plus of course Kim had a wide brief of other interests to cram in, among these composing six full opera scores, all of which are, according to state records, “better than any other in history”.Perhaps it’s just me, but as time has passed there has been something of the dictator-propaganda machine about the endless slew of Ronaldo-Messi facts and stats and milestones. You know the kind of thing. Six hundred goals. Fifty hat-tricks. Threw an apple over a petrol station. Only man to score simultaneously on a single day against every single team in the league.Gorging on this, cramming in great dripping handfuls of left-footed assists in a calendar year, or the fact that more people follow Cristiano Ronaldo on Instagram than have ever died in the whole of human history, you can grow a little dizzy. Why not a thousand goals? Why not a million goals? Worse, the thought occurs that these Ronaldo-Messi numbers are not robust, that they’re products of a moment in football history when money, talent-hoarding and changes in the rules have made it possible to dominate completely, ushering in this stream of super-numbers, all of them better than all the other numbers from times when such numbers were impossible.Except, of course, this isn’t quite right. Every now and then a stat crops up that really does take the breath away, a reminder that there is a cold hard edge of genius at work here. This week brought one of those. On Tuesday night Ronaldo scored four goals for Portugal in Vilnius to break Robbie Keane’s Euro qualifier goals record. More exciting still, Ronaldo is now on 93 international goals, 16 behind Ali Daei’s all-time international mark for Iran.Watching him against Lithuania he still looks like the same old Ronaldo, the same old snake-hipped robot-replicant physique, the sense of a man-sized wedding cake figurine miraculously come to life. The actual goals were pretty ragged: a penalty a triple-layered fluke (slip, bobble, deflection) a tap-in from a lovely pass by Bernardo Silva and a classy late sidefoot.Clearly Portugal will waltz through qualifying. Next up are Luxembourg twice, Ukraine and Lithuania at home. At this rate Ronaldo could end up passing the 100 goal mark before the end of the year, and then hauling in the all-time record at next year’s Euros. It is a startling prospect, if only because it is such a funny record for Ronaldo to break, a brilliantly literal-minded notion of greatness. “I’m going to score more goals than anyone else ever! This will mean that I’m the best!” And oddly enough, perhaps it might, if only because this is such an unusual, out-there feat in modern football.Just look at the top 10: Ali Daei, Kunishige Kamamoto, Godfrey Chitalu, Hussein Saeed, Bashar Abdullah, Sunil Chhetri. Add in Pelé, Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis. And now you know who. This not the kind of list anyone ever really talks about topping. No serious modern elite-level footballer actually scores 100 international goals. Daei’s record is an outlier, a much-loved folksy detail,: like Mull of Kintyre being No 1 for six months or the world’s tallest man always being mild-mannered Robert Wadlow in his waistcoat and sad specs. You don’t “chase down” or crowingly overhaul dear old Ali Daei.Except, of course, it turns out you do. At least if you have the capacity to reduce and refine your powers to the status of a kind of mobile goal-hammer, and in the process carry your team with you. Ronaldo scored his first Portugal goal for a nation that had never reached a major final. Fifteen years later, the Ronaldo , they’ve been in three and won two of them. Fifty-five of those 93 goals have come in tournament qualification. Nineteen have come in finals. As astonishing 56 have come in his past 60 caps.Yes: stat-blah, numberwang, glazed eyes. But no one else is doing this. And if he does get to 110 we may just have to accept that yes, goals are an incredibly simple metric but then yes, they’re also the metric that matters most. Part of Ronaldo’s strange brilliance has been to turn himself into a high-end product, human Coca-Cola, a substance that never changes, never ages, never exists as anything but pure, uncut, unvarying Ronaldo. More goals, more insistent, relentless influence. What more is he supposed to do?It won’t become clear how violently Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have distorted modern football until they are finally gone until it becomes clear this wasn’t just an evolutionary shift where genius-level attacking players would from now on dominate the sky. In fact they are simply stand-alone superstars, a brilliant fluke of all-time talent in the same time and space.Football has slightly choked on this in recent years. The absurdity of Neymar, the pointless urge to style a brilliant team player such as Raheem Sterling as the next GOAT-style inidualist: these are the aftershocks of the star culture we have naturally ingested as a side product. That era is entering its dog days. The passing of Daei’s goal record would be another significant endnote, perhaps even a suitable full-stop.

We’re having a meeting to discuss your role.”Faced with the task of securing an appropriate support person for the potentially tense meeting, Thompson, an aspiring comedian, said: “I thought it’s best to bring in a professional, and so I paid $200 and hired a clown.”The clown, who Thompson refers to as “Joe”, crafted balloon animals throughout the meeting, including a poodle. His antics were squeaky, and Thompson’s bosses had to request he quieten down several times.“It’s further understood,” reported the Herald, “that the clown mimed crying when the redundancy paperwork was handed over.”A picture of the meeting, taken through a boardroom’s glass doors by an unknown spectator, is of compromised quality, though one can detect that Joe, the clown, is wearing a colorful hat and a yellow bib, and that Thompson, leaning back in his chair, indeed looks relaxed for someone in the process of getting laid off.Thompson told Magic Talk radio: “I mean, I did get fired, but apart from that it was all smooth running.”Fortunately, Thompson will not be out of work for long. The Australian ad agency DDB confirmed Thompson will start a new role in its office next week.As of publishing, no reports have suggested what’s next for Joe."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cde7ea47f768a68b08ca995276a2a353d2c943d7/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c13b0a88851e1b86b472a223aaff9b1b","title":"a letter to my friends with children","story":"‘I do understand that your life has changed. But what about me? What about our friendship?’: the letter you always wanted to writeIt happens every time. I know it will, and I don’t begrudge it. Except I do, a bit. It’s happened so often, and now that I’m in my late 40s, and I am so practised at this, I can’t help but have the same awful thought every time a friend announces she is pregnant: “Well, there goes another friendship.”I am a woman who is child-free by choice. Great career, wonderful husband, lots of international vacations. I’m satisfied with my life. But it has become an inescapable fact that each time one of my female friends has a baby, our friendship changes. Believe me, I do understand that my friend’s life has changed. I also spend time with their children, as a favourite adopted aunt, and enjoy watching them grow. But what about me? What about our friendship?I am your caring and dedicated friend. I remember your favourite foods, those days in high school, that book that changed your life, to ask about you father’s health, and you have done the same for me. I never expected to be your priority all of the time but it would be such a joy and a relief to feel as if I was your priority even some of the time.Years back, a friend announced that she was moving closer to me, and I blurted out, “Great! Maybe we can have a night out together!” Without even pausing to consider the option, she said, “I’m a mum now!” Her tone was plain: how could I make this suggestion to someone with such weighty responsibilities?Someone I consider(ed) my best friend only responds to an invitation with an alternative date and plan, often for the one night she knows I have a standing obligation. It breaks my heart always to be second, almost as much as it fills my heart to know my friend is happy with the children she wanted.I wonder if my friends will want to re-establish our connection when their children leave home. I wonder why, just once a year, they can’t find a babysitter or leave the kids with their partner so we can talk and drink good wine on my patio, without their children throwing gravel into the neighbour’s garden.What I don’t wonder, though, is if I can ever say these words to them – because I know I cannot. As a woman without children, I am supposed to just “understand” that relationships change, and change will always mean a sad lessening of ties for me.• We will pay £25 for every letter we publish.

What’s behind the mini-me phenomenon?Jane Lawlor is giving me a tour of her Essex hotel. ‘Most of our suites come with views of the pool or the rolling fields of the Brentwood countryside, and our evening turn-down service includes lighting flameless candles and leaving luxury pillow treats,’ she says, handing me a glass of champagne in the hotel bar, where velvet sofas face a wood-burning stove. “We’re all about relaxation and privacy here, so most guests like to eat in peace via room service, choosing anything from pan-crusted cod to lobster tail with caviar. And wait till you see the spa – we offer the latest treatments using award-winning products.”Tempted to check-in? Well, I am afraid you can’t – unless you are a cat. This retreat, with rooms from £20 a night, is purely for felines, especially those with a taste for the finer things in life. Lawlor Cat hotel, which opened in 2016, has 23 suites, all of which are booked out months in advance by cats such as Vaishti, a persian chinchilla who has stayed five times in the past year, using the hotel’s £4-a-mile chauffeur service to and from her home in north London. “She listens to Andrea Bocelli during the journey. She melts when he sings and it keeps her calm,” says her owner, Barry Lobel, 40, a tech company CEO. “Once she’s there, I can log into the hotel’s CCTV and see that she gets treated exactly the way she would at home: like royalty. She always comes back perfectly groomed and rested.”Is there any human activity a pet now can’t muscle in on? In the US “bark mitzvah” ceremonies, catered for by specialist bakeries, are popular, while some companies offer between 10 hours and a week’s paid “pawternity leave” for new pet owners. Ikea’s pet range currently features a sofa bed that can extend for “puppy sleepovers”, while upmarket labels such as MiaCara sell minimalist pet furniture (Letto day bed, £797), alongside adventure products such as doggie sleeping bags and hiking boots.Prudence, a bull terrier, and Mr Binks, a rescue dog, both enjoy social outings such as doggy brunch and doggy cinema, at which they get their own seat, blanket and ice-cream. “I like taking them to different places for mental stimulation – I perish the thought that they would ever be bored,” says their owner, Anna Webb, a broadcaster and dog trainer. “They get the latest toys and their outfits range from practical, outdoors-weather clothing to dressing-up costumes and cashmere sweaters. Their bedding is a mix of hemp blankets and plush faux fur.” Not that they sleep in their beds: they share Webb’s, with Prudence mimicking her and sleeping like a person, under the duvet with her head on a pillow. Is that not a bit much? “I know it sounds bonkers, but why not embrace it? I don’t think we’re humanising animals any more than we have before – it’s just the way we live now gives us more choice. That enriches the lives of my dogs, while strengthening the bond we share.”It is not just dogs and cats some rabbits, now the third-most popular pet in the UK, get the treatment, too. Fay Williams from Warrington calls herself a “bunny mummy” to “super-spoilt” Olive. “She has her own room at the back of our house. When we go away, we book her into a retreat that specialises in looking after pampered rabbits. The owner lets me FaceTime her most days.”Even parrots, like Billy from West Yorkshire, aren’t missing out. “Every morning, he gets a decaffeinated tea and a better breakfast than me,” says his owner, Lauren Atkinson. “He eats a mixture of seeds with unsalted nuts and he’ll have some warm food like edamame beans, petits pois and sweetcorn mixed with almond milk twice a day. We call his extra-large cage ‘the palace’ – it has a play gym and java wooden stands and swings for him to relax on.”Atkinson is keen to add that she is not a “crazy cockatoo lady” – Billy has simply won her over. He has an Instagram account where he shares selfies and videos. “He’s got more toys than a toddler and loves playing hide-and-seek, shouting ‘Peekaboo’ when he finds you,” says Atkinson. “He’s formed a unique bond with all my family – our mental health has improved, and it makes me want to pamper him even more. He’s more than ‘just’ a pet.”Lisa Morton, co-founder of the pet-drinks specialist Woof\u0026ampBrew, has noticed a huge increase in people seeking shared experiences with their pets. “It means many more cafes, restaurants and hotels are opening their doors and welcoming dogs, which is where our products fit perfectly,” she says. “We launched six years ago with the world’s first herbal doggy teabag.” Since then, their Bottom Sniffer “beer” for dogs (made from a non-fermented beer wort with seaweed extract, chicken flavouring, burdock, dandelion, flax, nettle and rooibos) and pawsecco “wine” (an infusion of elderflower, linden blossom, ginseng, water, natural caramel and citric acid) for cats and dogs have been bestsellers Morton is expecting another big paws up for their latest herbal tonic, Champaws. She says the modern obsession with wellness has been key to the company’s success. “We know consumers have been increasingly seeking natural products for themselves, and in turn want the same for their pets.”Dogs such as Prudence and Mr Binks are her target customers. “I never compromise on their diet,” says Webb, who has had dogs for 18 years. “They eat the finest food designed for dogs – organic, ethically sourced meats – and Prudence has a special slow-feed bowl with ridges designed to make her meals last longer, and to make her eat more politely, while improving her digestion. I spend more on their food than on myself – because I know that will help keep them away from the vet.”As well as paying premium prices for their meals, Webb treats the dogs to special balms that help minimise the effects of rough pavements on their feet, and books them in for regular holistic health and spa treatments. “Prudence benefits from a regular oxygen facial available for dogs in Harley Street, London, as well as massages and red-light therapy, as she is boisterous and always pulling muscles. Mr Binks has regular acupuncture and red-light therapy for his hip, as he has a degenerative bone condition. It’s wonderful to have so many wellbeing options for them – things are getting more sophisticated.”Much of this shift is being driven by younger pet owners. “Millennials represent the largest segment of owners and are fuelling the humanisation trend,” says Nicole Cooper, managing director of the National Pet Show. “It might be because they’re drawn to the idea of ownership, and the emotional focus of looking after something.” As more young couples delay having children, many consider pets to be their “starter” babies.Does she think the pampering can go too far? “Oh yeah. Five years ago, I’d never expect dogs to turn up at the shop in a pram wearing a fancy dress outfit, or that I’d be giving a blueberry facial scrub to a vegan dog. Some owners say there’s never a moment where their dog is left on its own, and that leaving them with us is harder than leaving their child at nursery.”Darcy, a cockapoo and “dog blogger” from west London, has travelled to more than 20 countries with her owner, May Wong. Recently, she had a wardrobe made to house her outfits and accessories. She also had a birthday party with her pooch pals at Cliveden House hotel in Buckinghamshire, where the Duchess of Sussex spent the night before the royal wedding.“It might sound over the top, but the indulgence comes from a deep emotional attachment,” says Wong. “I have no family and I know Darcy only cares about me. So when you experience that kind of loyalty, that you don’t always get from other people, you want to give them the best you can.”Is there a dark side to all this fussing? According to the British Veterinary Association (BVA), the golden rules of pet care are simple: provide them with a suitable diet and environment protect them from pain and make sure they are able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns. Daniella Dos Santos, the junior vice-president of the BVA, says some of the more absurd new trends aren’t ticking those boxes, adding that we shouldn’t lose sight of the fact that animals’ health and welfare needs are different from ours. “Inappropriate anthropomorphism, such as giving them too many treats or human foods and treating them as fashion accessories, is unnecessary and potentially harmful,” she says. “Pet costumes can restrict movement and their ability to regulate temperature, while ‘handbag dogs’ can suffer from poor socialisation, as they don’t get as many opportunities to interact with other dogs.” Her advice? “If in doubt, go back to basics and ask whether that expensive fad is really going to deliver any tangible benefits to your pet.” Does she think fresh pet food is any better than the processed variety? “The most important thing is giving pets a balanced diet with specialist nutritionist input. Processed pet food may have science behind it, fresh food may not necessarily be specifically formulated to pets’ needs – so owners really should speak to their vet for tailored advice.”At Lawlor Cat hotel, the requests keep coming. “One couple recently ordered their cat, and all 14 cat guests staying in the hotel at the time, a premium à la carte dish: the prawn and crayfish tian. Because it was what they served their (human) wedding guests. They all got to celebrate, too,” says Lawlor, stroking one of her guests.And if the lengths people are prepared to go to often sound like a joke, Lawlor thinks our pets are the ones having the last laugh. “We think we are humanising them, but I think they’re the ones controlling us. They’ve looked around, they’ve studied us and thought: ‘I could train this one.’”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068e1e5b210a609aa90ad859f0e1b5881fdde2ac/1191_1478_1914_1149/master/1914.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e00f665e3390ddc47cdccadffc23b937","title":"katharine hamnett fashion designer interview","story":"The designer on boarding school, wanting to heal the planet and being fashion’s first whistleblowerBorn in Kent, Hamnett, 72, studied fashion at Saint Martin’s School of Art.

I always find this a bizarre argument – one that takes something that your parents used to say to you when you were eight and wouldn’t finish your meal, and uses it to ignore the festival’s cultural history, as well as the huge number of things that are part of our everyday lives and far more abhorrent when it comes to the question of waste.But my issue, in the end, is not with the argument, but with the level of certainty with which the person expressed it. Social media has exacerbated a trend whereby people speak with complete authority on every subject, regardless of how informed they are.I recently filmed a travel show in Mongolia, where we got an eagle to hunt a radio-controlled car with a stuffed fox on it, for creative reasons that I don’t want to get into now. But that scene turned out to be the Pied Piper of trolls, and quite a few came out of the woodwork. There were a lot of people complaining about me enforcing my vegan views on people, but that’s fine – I respect their right to do so. What got me was one person telling me that the eagle had probably broken its claw and so would have to be released into the wild, as a result of my cruel “prank”.The level of inside knowledge this person claimed to have, about something that five people were present to observe, was breathtaking. From their invented starting point, they extrapolated an angry argument, suggesting that it would have been more humane to use a real fox that would have died. But the eagle did not break its claw. I know this because I was there. On the same show, I went to Colombia and toured the country with the radio host Heisel Mora. While the show was broadcast, a woman tweeted me at various points to inform me that Heisel had not found what I was saying funny, and that she was offended, and that this was why we could never be friends. She knew far more about the week I had spent with Heisel than I did, on the basis of an edited one-hour show.It has been much documented that we have all become experts, but these social media posts are a sign that people are evolving to a place way beyond expertise. We are entering an age where people can claim to know more about what really happened than the people who were there. Where people will dismiss eyewitness accounts, on the basis of their gut feelings where they will refute scientific discoveries because the scientist just doesn’t look trustworthy.Perhaps this was always a logical next step, now that we are living in times when the people we are supposed to trust are doing so little to earn it. But where will all this lead? Evidence will become irrelevant, arguments will become nonsensical and, worst of all, columnists will try to make wild generalisations about societal behaviour based on three social media posts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e810e997a7aa0d722f848b4a0432060613d0b70/856_1062_3858_2315/master/3858.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbd7cba0824d2ccff2593cdaca3bbe3","title":"what was toy of century in 2000 the weekend quiz","story":"From Osborne House to Panenka, test your knowledge with the Weekend quiz1 If Seth was number three, who were number one and number two?2 Where is the Cradle of Humankind located?3 Which Shakespeare title character is killed halfway through the play?4 Which denomination euro banknote is no longer in circulation?5 Who was “no Jack Kennedy”?6 What micro-animals are nicknamed water bears?7 What was named Toy of the Century in 2000?8 Abel Meeropol wrote which anti-lynching anthem?What links:9 Solway Firth and Marshall Meadows Bay, over a distance of 96 miles?10 The Eagles the Shadows the Band? 11 Dartmouth Eleanor Beaver (1773)?12 Artemisia Gentileschi Sofonisba Anguissola Lavinia Fontana?13 Flip flap rabona Panenka Marseille turn?14 Grass river mud forest snowstorm cave?15 Osborne House Quarr Abbey Carisbrooke Castle?1 Cain and Abel (Adam and Eve’s named children).2 Gauteng, South Africa (paleo-anthropological site).3 Julius Caesar.4 500 euro.5 Dan Quayle (according to Lloyd Bentsen, 1988).6 Tardigrades (moss piglets).7 Lego (British Association of Toy Retailers).8 Strange Fruit.9 Anglo-Scottish Border.10 One-time backing bands: Linda Ronstadt Cliff Richard Bob Dylan.11 Ships in the Boston Tea Party.12 Women painters of the Italian Renaissance \u0026amp Baroque.13 Football tricks and skills.14 Obstacles in Michael Rosen’s We’re Going on a Bear Hunt.15 Historic buildings on the Isle of Wight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/309e0e5c6e239f0e76a65de4b9b7eed98e00f2e6/428_0_5140_3084/master/5140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95caeb48a1b230f4c5620fe8f456fb2e","title":"between the covers how the british fell out of love with magazines","story":"Marie Claire’s closure highlights print titles’ struggle for survival in the age of online media Another gap is about to appear on your newsagent’s shelf. This week Marie Claire announced the closure of its UK print edition, adding to an expanding list of high-profile titles from NME to FHM that have succumbed to the digital revolution.The British love affair with consumer magazines has become increasingly tepid since the arrival of online competitors such as YouTube and Facebook, compounded by the new leisure-time lures of Netflix and Amazon.Marie Claire is the latest title to succumb, 31 years after its launch as “the thinking woman’s magazine”. It mixed serious features with fashion and beauty as it took a pioneering stance on topical women’s issues, which helped it garner four Amnesty Media Awards, including one for a report on rape as a weapon of war in the Congo. Liz Jones, the editor from 1999 to 2001, was fired after speaking out against being forced to use bulimic models. But as it blazed an editorial trail, circulation fell from a peak of more than 450,000 in the mid-90s to 120,000 now.The magazine business is in trouble, and its problems are summed up by the current top 10 chart of consumer titles that readers buy or subscribe to. In the first half of this year the total circulation of that top 10 was 4.7m – half the 9.4m recorded in the first six months of 2001.The roll call of well-known print casualties in recent years includes the lads’ mags generation of FHM, Loaded, Maxim, Nuts and Zoo female-focused titles such as More!, Look, Instyle, celebrity gossip magazine Now, She magazine and Reveal.Last year, NME stopped printing after 66 years and free magazine Shortlist, the biggest men’s magazine in the UK by circulation, also closed down.And experts believe it is only going to get worse. “There is a crisis in the industry,” says Douglas McCabe, the chief executive of Enders Analysis. “Given how much circulation has fallen there really haven’t been as many outright closures as you’d think. Some publishers are just hanging on. We would expect to see more closures in the next five years than the previous five.”He adds: “There is social media, Instagram, Mail Online. So why go out and buy a magazine, even a strong brand, when you can get updates every second? And that’s without the wider fight for consumers’ attention from services such as YouTube and even Netflix.”There are some bright spots, however, where online offerings have failed to offer a compelling alternative. TV listing magazines including TV Choice, the nation’s biggest-selling title at 1.1m per issue, What’s on TV, Take a Break and Radio Times remain top-selling staples.“In terms of TV listings their resilience is because there still isn’t anything out there online that is better,” says McCabe.There are others, he says, that are still thriving: “Titles that are being invested in, that have a confidence and attitude like weekly news brands the Economist, Private Eye and the Week, have also bucked the trend.”Against the bleak sales backdrop the publishers are increasingly focusing on using a household brand built up over decades to seek profitability beyond print. Marie Claire, for instance, will continue online and its owner says the title is simply following the readers.“It is very similar to the route we took with NME,” says Marcus Rich, the chief executive of Marie Claire’s UK publisher, TI Media. “There are just certain reader demographics that have moved to smartphones, or the web, and it makes sense to move digital-first. It was a logical evolution as a lot of focus was spent on trying to sustain a print model now we can focus online.”The biggest challenge with chasing readers online is fighting the stranglehold the Silicon Valley giants have on eyeballs – and the advertising pounds that follow them.As print advertising in consumer magazines dries up – by the end of this year it will have more than halved from £512m in 2010 to £220m – publishers are branching out into areas such as e-commerce and events.The stockmarket-listed publisher Future, which has a portfolio of 100 publishing brands from the gadget magazine T3 to the rock title Metal Hammer, has bucked the malaise and seen its market value hit a record high of £1bn.However, the chief executive, Zillah Byng-Thorne, says just one-third of its more than £200m in annual revenue now comes from traditional print advertising or magazine sales. The company now makes tens of millions of pounds from the commission it earns from sales of products to readers who make a purchase from a partner – such as Amazon or John Lewis – after reading a product review on one of its sites.At the tough end of the consumer magazine market, dual online and print strategies are also starting to show real promise. Earlier this year the Face, the style magazine that defined the 80s and 90s, made a comeback after 15 years with a web strategy backed by a quarterly magazine. And two years after the UK’s then 10th bestselling magazine, Glamour, cut its print run to just twice a year and went digital-first, it is now on track to be back in profit for 2019.But for many other titles, as Marie Claire has just shown, the ability to stay in print in any form is an ongoing struggle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5af2704740eb128bae1d8b58ad6b5b7cb3288a09/0_19_5455_3275/master/5455.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=478d6f3a40cc86b230d92a78b2bbd6c2","title":"reporting on hurricane dorian it was a scene of complete devastation","story":"New York reporter recalls challenges of covering a disaster as huge as the category 5 storm that ripped through the BahamasHow do you start an interview with someone who has just lost everything?With the floodwaters just receded, the stench of mould beginning to creep into the hollowed-out buildings that survived two days of pummelling winds, and bloated corpses still being recovered, that was a question I was forced to grapple with last week in the Bahamas.There is no correct answer. The best I have come up with, in my time covering mass shootings, natural disasters, and police violence in the US, is that you take a step back and allow the interviewee time, space and freedom to think about your questions – and you don’t even start if they don’t want to share.Last Friday, I was among a small group of journalists to visit the destroyed town of High Rock on the island of Grand Bahama. We were the first reporters to make it there after the eye of Hurricane Dorian, a monster category 5 storm that destroyed parts of this picture-perfect archipelago, ripped through the area.It was a scene of complete devastation with most houses reduced to their concrete foundations. In one remaining building, I met Erica Roberts, a 41-year-old who still bore cuts on her arms and face after having clung to a tree branch for hours to escape the storm surge. She had not heard from seven relatives, including two sons, whom she feared were dead.But in this moment of unfolding crisis, she was incredibly clear: she wanted her story to be heard by as many people as possible.Which brings you to the next question. What do you ask?There is increasing scientific consensus that the climate crisis is making hurricanes stronger. Warming sea and air can contribute to a storm’s intensity. Rising sea levels can make storm surge more deadly. The number of severe Atlantic hurricanes has roughly doubled in the past 20 years. Dorian was the fourth category 5 to make landfall in the past three years. It shares the record for the most intense storm in history.Before we arrived on Grand Bahama I had already asked my editors in New York to what extent we should be asking survivors of their views on the climate crisis. It’s a delicate balance to strike, injecting an issue that can be perceived as deeply political into a personal tragedy.The decision was to ask tentatively and give people there the chance to share their views. Most outlets covering this story have not mentioned the climate in dispatches from the ground. Personally, I couldn’t imagine not mentioning it.And numerous people I spoke to were keen to share their thoughts, most of them very aware of the science.“I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” Roberts told me. “I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.”Gaining access to remote areas hit by natural disasters, like those in the Bahamas, can be a tricky thing to navigate. When Dorian’s path was less certain I was dispatched by the New York news desk to cover it from the United States.I flew into Savannah, Georgia, when it seemed almost certain the storm would hit the coastline in that region, but hurricanes can change course quickly and within 12 hours we realised that the Bahamas had been so badly hit we needed to get there. I drove about 500 miles to Miami and jumped on a flight to the Bahamian capital, Nassau.But even from here, accessing the islands in the north-western region of the Bahamas was almost impossible. Royal Marine helicopter rescue crews were swamped with evacuees. The airports in the region were either destroyed or flooded. Some news networks were paying in excess of $10,000 (£8,000) just to fly over the region to see the scale of devastation.Eventually, an opportunity presented itself. Word got out that a Royal Caribbean cruise liner was destined for Grand Bahama to deliver aid, and would allow a small group of journalists to embed with them.It was a surreal experience, stepping from the luxury of a giant cruise ship into the devastation of a disaster zone with no running water or power. But the ship allowed us to get out to some of the most remote communities destroyed by Dorian. I filed my first story from the seat of a humid minivan, attempting, mostly in vain, to connect to the internet via hotspot.My colleague David Smith, who is currently on the Abaco Islands, another archipelago destroyed by Dorian, is embedded with British aid workers at a medical centre in Treasure Cay, using satellite internet to send his dispatches.Our coverage of Dorian required coordination with journalists around the globe. We worked with reporters and live bloggers in New York, London and Sydney, collaborated with a brilliant photojournalist, Angel Valentin, throughout the trip, and consulted with technical support staff who offered frequent assistance on communications issues.But the most challenging aspect of this reporting is the inability to communicate with the people you leave behind. Erica Roberts, like others I interviewed, had lost all her possessions, meaning she had no phone or internet access.We spoke for only 10 minutes as I hurried back to catch a boat. Although the government of the Bahamas has pledged to evacuate everyone on the islands most affected, should they choose to go, most people who survived have had their lives altered forever. almost always returns to areas hit by natural disasters to examine recovery efforts in the long term. I expect the Bahamas will be no different.In the meantime, here’s how you can help the relief efforts in the Bahamas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b82267f95b6f0f314f612ab7bf492fdb2557c49c/0_340_8684_5210/master/8684.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b02d6cd2556437bb820bf18c3313bec","title":"50p britons living costs 1969 spending","story":"It’s a half century since the 50p went into circulation. Here’s how our spending has transformedThe front page of the  carried stories on the two burning issues of the day: the eruption of violence in Northern Ireland, and the endless negotiations over the UK joining the EEC. The chief comment piece was speculation about a forthcoming general election, with Labour behind in the polls. And a large advert from the Decimal Currency Board proclaimed the arrival that day of the “50 new penny piece”.The 50p coin entered circulation on 14 October 1969, in the run-up to D-Day on 15 February 1971, when the UK finally abandoned shillings and pence and moved to a decimal currency.The 50p coin was worth a lot then – indeed, more than any coin in circulation now. In real terms it was worth the equivalent of just over £8. Fifty years on, especially after rampaging inflation in the 1970s, the 50p is a shadow of its former self – it has shrunk in size and weight, but above all in value. Today’s 50p now only has the buying power of the old “tanner” – the small 6d piece.Back then, when booze was relatively cheap, it really was possible to go for a night out and still have change from 50p. A 50p piece in 1969 could buy you three pints of mild or bitter (priced about two shillings, equal to 10p) while a tube fare on the newly opened Victoria line in London cost just 5d (2.2p). You’d still have enough left to buy a portion of chips and a copy of the , then priced at 6d (2.5p).Are we much better off than 50 years ago?  Money searched prices of goods in 1969 and compared them with today. This shows that in real terms, food, clothes, electrical goods and holidays have collapsed in price and we can afford much more. But there has been a vast relative increase in the price of housing.What is extraordinary about the wages data from the late 1960s is the huge gap between men and women. The ONS New Earnings Survey unfortunately gives no figures for 1969, but for 1970 it shows that the average full-time male worker was paid £30 a week, while a female full-time worker earned just £16.30. Annually, that worked out at £1,560 for men, which is equal to £24,050 today, but only £847.60 for women, equal to £13,068 today.The figures suggest that real pay for the average male has risen by about a third over the last 50 years, but for women it has doubled. These figures, though, need to be taken with a large pinch of salt: they are averages, not the median figure, and reflect gross earnings rather than take-home pay after tax.A look through the ’s classified job adverts on the day the 50p was launched gives a snapshot of what real jobs paid. The Open University, which had just been established, was hiring professors at £3,780 a year (equal to £62,532 today), lecturers on a range of £1,240 to £2,850 (£20,153-£47,147), and secretaries on £756-£1,068 (£12,506-£17,668).The Open University is still hiring – and its adverts suggest that real pay for academics has barely edged ahead in 50 years. It currently has an advert for a professor of economics on a range of £67,700-£75,800, while it pays lecturers £33,000 to £49,000. But the secretary job pays lots more in today’s money, with the OU advertising a role at £23,000 to £26,000.Rampant sexism was a staple for job adverts in 1969, even in the . On that day, we carried an advert for a personnel officer at a new Courtaulds textile factory in Skelmersdale. The ad specified it had to be a man because Courtaulds was expanding its all-male labour force from 400 men to 1,200 men.In real terms, house prices in 1969 were just a third of their level today. The average house sold for £4,312 – equal to £71,333 in today’s money, which would not even buy you a garage in north-west London.One reason house prices were lower was that we all had less free money to spend after buying food. Chicken was about three times the price we pay today, while bread, eggs, coffee and sugar were about double the prices in supermarkets today.But comparing like with like is made tough by the change in weights and measures since 1969, as Britain went metric in the 1970s.What we are eating has also changed. While beef brisket, luncheon meat, dried prunes and corned beef appear in the ONS data for 1969, it’s not until 1996 that prices of avocado and grapes were collected. And instant coffee appears to have been a thoroughly modern new thing in 1969, having appeared in the ONS data for the first time a year earlier.Clothes have also dramatically fallen in price in real terms since 1969. We were unable to obtain like-for-like prices of goods from then, but the fashion page of the  that day gives an indication. We featured a black-and-white wool coat at £34 in Debenhams – equal to £562 today – and a men’s sheepskin coat at 38 guineas, equal to £662 today. Of the 670 coats in Debenhams’ online store today, the most expensive is £349. of 14 October 1969 carried a story in the business pages on a major breakthrough for Granada Rentals – it would offer a colour TV for a rent of just £1 a week. That’s equal to £865 a year in today’s money, but all you got was one channel in colour (BBC2) while the other two channels, BBC1 and ITV, still broadcast in black and white.Renting, even at those prices, was the only option for most people because colour TV sets cost astronomical prices. Our story said that a 19-inch set cost 199 guineas – nearly £4,000 in today’s money – at Currys, and Dennis Curry was reporting that sales had been “rather restrained”. The Granada Rentals deal was for an 11-inch TV set.Not that there was a lot to watch in colour. Broadcasting on BBC2 began at 7pm that evening, with rugby league coverage of Hull v Wigan the primetime offering.Only half of Britain’s homes owned a refrigerator in 1969, dishwashers were almost unheard of, and microwaves were in only a tiny number of homes. And without the likes of Ikea, home furnishings cost far more in real terms then than they do today.If you fancy going to see Fiddler on the Roof, now on at London’s Playhouse theatre, seat prices for a typical October matinee range from £20 to £145. Back in 1969, an advert in the  showed that Fiddler on the Roof was also playing, but at Her Majesty’s theatre. And the prices? There was a special offer of Wednesday matinees at 5s to 25s – or 25p to £1.25. Adjusting for inflation, that means seats were going for just £4 to a top price of £20. West End theatre appears to have quadrupled in price in real terms since the 1960s.In Oxford, the Sadler’s Wells opera was on tour, charging from 6 to 226 (30p to £1.12) to see Madam Butterfly at the Playhouse. That’s equal to £4.80 to £18.50 today. Currently Macbeth is booking at the Playhouse, priced at £10 to £30, so real prices appear to have doubled.In the pubs, we found Guinness at 19d (9p), and mild and bitter at 10p. Adjusted for today, beer prices have doubled in real terms. Mateus Rosé was the most popular wine in the world then: the Queen drank it, and Jimi Hendrix was photographed swigging it out of the bottle.

But it’s not the first version of the coin minted in 1969.The Royal Mint puts 120m new 50p coins into circulation on 14 October 1969, which at the time was the biggest ever issue of a new coin – giving it almost zero rarity value.On eBay, 1969 50p coins can be bought for as little as 75p. Given that 50 years ago the 50p coin had the buying power of £8 today, it has been a pretty poor investment.The 50p coin to watch out for is the more recent 2009 issue that carries a picture of Kew Gardens on the reverse. Just 210,000 of the coins were minted to mark the 250th anniversary of the Royal Botanic Gardens, compared with 19.9m Peter Rabbit 50p coins last year.According to coin dealers, the Kew Gardens 50p coins can fetch £70-£80. But, beware, there are two types – the “circulated” one is much rarer than the shinier “uncirculated” coins, which only pick up about £10-£20 on eBay.Keep an eye out for the 50p coins issued to celebrate the London Olympics in 2012. Dominic Chorney at coin dealers Baldwin’s says some are worth £3-£4, depending on the sport featured.Chorney adds that despite the move towards a cashless society – the Royal Mint did not produce any 1p or 2p coins last year, neither did it make any new £2 coins – coin collecting remains popular, with record prices at auction for the rarest items.In January this year, a five guinea “Vigo”’ coin minted in 1703 fetched the highest price ever paid for a British coin. It sold at Baldwin’s auction in New York for $1.08m (£876,000)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6de53bbc2260febc167488209afe81844c47ecaa/0_225_5352_3211/master/5352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac3177e0259e42c9c05f6fa96cc6642f","title":"missy elliott interview beyonce vmas katy perry misdemeanor","story":"As she returns to the spotlight, the hip-hop icon talks Michelle Obama, collaborations and the truth behind her hiatusIt must have been an eye-opening experience to watch Missy Elliott’s performance at the MTV video music awards last month if you had never encountered her before. Her six-song medley was a thrill-ride of kaleidoscopic visuals, VMAdancers and costume changes: Elliott was a cyberqueen, a B-girl, a scarecrow, an airborne beachball, a one-woman advertisement for what pop music can be. The performance, marking her video vanguard award, instantly went viral, capped a year of honours (an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music, the first female rapper in the Songwriters Hall of Fame) and coincided with the Iconology EP, her first new body of work since 2005. It dazzled the uninitiated while reminding millions of older fans what a vital creative force the 48-year-old was and how much we had missed her.Two days later, Elliott is still bathing in goodwill. “It’s a blessing,” she says, calling from New York. “A blessing!” She has a throaty southern accent and a brilliant, exclamatory laugh. After a month of planning and two weeks of rehearsals, she says the set went like a dream. “The only time I was scared was when I was backstage and I had to keep changing clothes really fast. I thought: ‘Oh God, I’m not going to have my pants on in time. I might be in my panties!’ Ha ha!”This is not Elliott’s first comeback but it feels different. The last time she returned to the public eye, as Katy Perry’s guest during the Super Bowl half-time show in 2015, she “freaked out” the night before, daunted by the size of the audience and the length of time she had been away. “I ended up in the hospital for having an anxiety attack,” she says. “I think any artist who has had a break such as that one would be anxious. I remember Katy saying: ‘This is the perfect time to perform your new record. It’s the biggest platform.’ I was like: ‘I don’t even know if they remember the old ones so I most definitely don’t want to do a new one!’ I’m always anxious whenever I drop anything because you just never know if they’re going to get it. So I’m always biting my nails and pacing the floor.”Elliott was meant to release her long-overdue seventh album that year but after just one brilliant single, WTF (Where They From), she returned to her quieter life as a writer, producer and guest MC. “I hate to say I’m back because in reality I never went nowhere,” she insists. “I was still doing stuff behind the scenes. I don’t always want to be upfront. I’m very shy.” I suggest that anyone watching her fly through the air in an inflatable leather suit at the VMAs would not automatically diagnose her with shyness. “I was like that as a child,” she says. “We would have family reunions and they always wanted me to get up on the table to perform. After an hour of them begging me, I would finally get on the table and become this other little kid. Then they couldn’t get me off. Once I set foot on the stage, I block out everything. I can be in my own world.”Melissa Elliott first constructed a private world as a child in Virginia. It was a fantastical refuge from a violent father, an abusive cousin and the grind of poverty when reality fails you, build your own. Behind her bedroom door, she was a star, practising acceptance speeches in the mirror and performing to an audience of dolls. “The teacher would ask what everyone wanted to be and I said: ‘I’m going to be a superstar.’ And everyone in the class would laugh. I wonder if those kids remember me to this day, because I remember everyone.”In high school, Elliott formed an R\u0026ampB group called Fayze, who later signed with the Swing Mob label under the name Sista and moved to New York. But Sista flopped and the Swing Mob crew dissolved, so Elliott didn’t hit her stride until she returned to her home state in 1995 with her best friend and producer Tim “Timbaland” Mosley. “Timbaland was more quiet than me and I’m super-shy so just imagine,” she says. “He’s most definitely not like that now! Through him I met Pharrell and we all bonded.”Missy “Misdemeanor” Elliott could do it all – sing, rap, write, produce – but what she and Timbaland were doing was so far out that they needed to prove themselves, first by working on Aaliyah’s 1996 album One in a Million. It was the shape of R\u0026ampB to come: radical yet irresistible. For her own The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly), Elliott cooked up a joyfully bizarre video with director Hype Williams to let people know who they were dealing with. “It helped people understand the type of artist that I am: witty, with a fun, comical sense, but futuristic, too.” Suddenly, everybody wanted a piece of her.Elliott remembers receiving calls from Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson in a single month. “It happened so fast that I’m just now getting a chance to sit back and re-evaluate everything,” she says. “This year has allowed me to look back over my life and be like: ‘Wow.’” When she watches the spectacular video for her 1999 single She’s a Bitch, in which she rises out of the ocean like a bald cyborg, she’s amazed. “I think: ‘Where was my mind at? What space was we in to create records like that?’ So many moments I look back and wish that I knew what I was thinking at the time.” Like a hip-hop Doctor Strange, Elliott was a reality-bender. On hits such as Get Ur Freak On and Work It she made everything elastic – voice, rhythm, language, body – until the usual rules ceased to apply. Both avant-garde and platinum-popular, she revolutionised hip-hop and R\u0026ampB while also wowing the likes of Thom Yorke, Damon Albarn and Björk. Her videos with Hype Williams and Dave Meyers were no less game-changing than her records, each one a reinvention. She credits Elektra Records for running with her imagination. “Not once did they say: ‘No, you can’t do this.’ I would bring stuff to them and they’d be like: ‘Let’s do it.’ The only time you get pushback is when they realise the budget is a million dollars.” She laughs. “Then they’re like: ‘Wait a minute … ’”Simultaneously, she and Timbaland created startling hits for other artists, including Tweet, Melanie B and Destiny’s Child, featuring a 16-year-old Beyoncé. “It wasn’t that Beyoncé came in and was loud or ‘Look at me, I’m gonna be the star,’” Elliott remembers. “She was very sweet. But when she went in the booth, that’s when I knew.” Beyoncé later appeared on Elliott’s 2002 track Nothing Out There for Me. “I said: ‘Hey, I want you to rap a little bit.’ And she was like: ‘Miss, if I sound crazy, don’t put this out!’ And I said: “Trust me, B, I’m not gonna allow you to sound crazy.’ She went in there and now she’s rapping better than me!”In recent years, critics have emphasised the political impact of Elliott’s work. By radiating pleasure and freedom while upending expectations about race, gender and body image, she was an empowering figure, although she insists that was a byproduct rather than an agenda. “Never, ever once did I think of making a political statement. I did what I did. I didn’t know that it would become that for others later.” She enjoys it, though. “To know that it has been taken that way, I’m happy.”Then, in 2005, Elliott effectively put her solo career on ice. What happened? “Well, I’m going to be honest, there were a lot of things,” she says hesitantly. One was overwork. A stranger to holidays, she was always either working on her own music (six albums in eight years) or someone else’s. “I needed to refresh my mind. Then I got sick, so that was another thing.” In 2008, after three years of chronic fatigue and drastic weight loss, she was diagnosed with Graves’ disease, a thyroid disorder, and treated with radiation therapy. Even once she was able to resume recording, Elliott’s hiatus between albums became self-perpetuating: the longer she stayed away, the harder it was to come back. Without deadlines or financial pressure (she invested wisely), her perfectionism took over. She disappeared into the studio, racking up several albums’ worth of unreleased material. “You end up building up a trillion records,” she says. “It’s easier for me to write for other people and not be as critical. I’m very hard on myself. I’m like: ‘Let me see if I can make something better,’ so you just keep powering on.”The overwhelming, instant scrutiny of social media exacerbated this self-doubt. Earlier this year, Cardi B tweeted about anxiety and Elliott sympathised: “Many people deal with this … i am one … it’s real.” This wasn’t something that rappers discussed publicly in the 90s. “Anxiety and depression, I’m not gonna lie, I rarely heard that back then,” she says. “But now I hear it a lot. Before social media you really didn’t know what people thought of you but now it’s so in your face that I think it probably gives a lot of artists anxiety. You have a lot of people coming at you, good or bad.” So she stuck to supporting roles on records by the likes of Ariana Grande, Janet Jackson, the Missy-indebted Lizzo and debut recording artist Michelle Obama: Elliott was the highlight of Obama’s 2016 charity single This Is for My Girls. “I wasn’t gonna say no. Y’know, it’s Michelle Obama. Am I really gonna be like: ‘Nah Michelle, I’m busy!’ She made me feel she was in my family. I almost forgot she was the First Lady.”Now, finally, Elliott is “most definitely” ready to take the plunge and release that album, self-doubt be damned. “This time the label is like: ‘Knock it off, Missy Misdemeanor Elliott!’ Ha ha!”The good news is that new music means live shows. The bad news is that these might have to take the form of a Las Vegas residency because Elliott’s ideas may be too ambitious to be portable. “It’s going to be a lot because there’s so much going in my mind,” she says. “My mind is like a rollercoaster. It’s like an amusement park. Heh heh heh.” At long last, Missyland is reopening for business.Missy Elliott’s Iconology EP is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/513cf56bb469051222e92799fde6158c27f4a4dd/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=426c794c4244b6c1055502b3b2a4adb4","title":"its all gone how hurricane dorian devastated the bahamas podcast","story":"Oliver Laughland tells Rachel Humphrys about the destruction he witnessed in the Bahamas in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian.

Tony Blair described having to learn to use a mobile phone, after years when aides took charge of all his communications. Theresa May was to be seen earlier this week pottering about in the palace of Westminster, not a flunky in sight, buying herself lunch.But the sense from David Cameron’s Times interview is that the hardest readjustment has been getting used to the idea of not always being a winner.Cameron once reportedly said he wanted to be prime minister, because “I think I’d be good at it” and when he unexpectedly secured a majority at the 2015 general election, he and George Osborne saw it as confirmation of their political genius.They were indeed clever, and ruthless – but not ruthless enough, it turned out, when it came to the brutal 2016 referendum campaign, the outcome of which Cameron says made him “depressed”.Much of his fury is directed at Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, his erstwhile political and personal friends, whom he accuses of behaving “appallingly”.Ironically, had Cameron’s memoir been published several months ago when it was originally due to appear, these character notes on his old rivals would have seemed of little more than historical interest.But he has burst out of his shepherd’s hut just as the Vote Leave crew are back together in Downing Street, and applying the same battering-ram approach to parliament, the judiciary and anyone else who stands in their way, as they did to the Stronger In campaigners in 2016.And the “Tory psychodrama” that he claims prevented the remainers’ message from getting through has become a full-scale civil war, that could yet rend his old party in two.Yet what Dave doesn’t really seem to feel, is a heavy weight of personal responsibility.Osborne apparently still chides him, “you and your fucking referendum”.But Cameron still believes it was necessary and all but inevitable because of the pressures inside his own party and out in the country at large and that his EU renegotiation was a grand idea that could have been a “boon” for Britain if the leavers’ dastardly tactics hadn’t stopped him from getting his message across to the great British public.And his analysis of the great rupture of Brexit appears to be that its causes lie more in the political swordsmanship of that brief campaign in the summer of 2016, than in the years of public sector austerity, industrial decline and anti-immigrant rhetoric that preceded it.It’s much too soon to say, of course – but history may well judge otherwise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/860dc81d49632104580b413e5abdd2c8eacaa49b/0_193_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=853ea87535ea2e9df7af364cfdf9b3a6","title":"tories misrepresent critical bbc news article in facebook ad","story":"Incorrect figure on school spending used alongside BBC logo and web addressThe Conservative party has been funding ads on Facebook that present a BBC News article as endorsing the government’s inflated figure for school spending – when the article actually criticised the figure’s credibility.Since the beginning of September the Conservative party has paid for ads on Facebook that link to a BBC article on school funding, with the headline “£14 billion pound cash boost for schools” appearing between a photo with the BBC News logo and its web address BBCNews.Sean Coughlan, the BBC’s education editor, said the BBC article only used the government’s £14bn figure in order to dismiss it. “The only reference to the £14bn figure in the story is from the head of stats saying it’s not a correct figure to use,” Coughlan said on Twitter.A spokesperson for the BBC said: “We are looking into this matter.”The BBC News article by Coughlan carried the headline: “School spending: multi-billion pound cash boost announced,” referring to the increased funding for schools in England announced by Boris Johnson in August.But the BBC article noted that annual school spending would rise by £2.6bn initially and culminate in extra annual funding in three-year’s time of £7.1bn – half the amount trumpeted in the Conservative party’s Facebook ads.The article carried analysis by Robert Cuffe, the BBC’s head of statistics, discussing the funding announcement: “The prime minister said he would invest ‘over £14bn in primary and secondary education between now and 2022-23’. That includes an additional £2.6bn next year, £4.8bn the year after that and £7.1bn in 2022-23. When you add all three together, you get £14.5bn, but that’s not normally how we talk about spending increases.”Cuffe concluded: “Describing this as a £14bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being.”Full Fact, the fact-checking organisation that first wrote about the ads, said about 200,000-500,000 impressions of different versions of the ads had been displayed on Facebook. The ads appear to have been deactivated today.“If you were looking at the ad the Conservative party posted, you would be forgiven for thinking that the BBC headline actually read ‘£14 billion pound cash boost for schools’,” Full Fact stated.Some versions of the ad carried photos of Johnson and linked directly to the Conservative party website, with the headline: “We’re giving a £14 billion cash boost to schools across the UK.”Another version of the ad began: “Tell this news to a friend. We’re giving schools a record £14bn, levelling up per pupil funding across the country.”In his speech confirming the additional spending, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, told parliament: “Today we are delivering on our pledge to increase school spending by £7.1 billion by 2022-23.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bfd1fab107e1ad17ed62c23ea3091dff29f19bc8/0_1_1459_875/master/1459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5603c3016b8850b4b289558f44176c96","title":"black hole at centre of our galaxy is getting hungrier say scientists","story":"Scientists say Milky Way’s Sagittarius A* has been more active in recent months Unseeable and inescapable, black holes already rank among the more sinister phenomena out in the cosmos. So it may come as disconcerting news that the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way appears to be growing hungrier.Astronomers monitoring the colossal object, called Sagittarius A*, found that in the past year it appears to have consumed nearby matter at an unprecedented rate.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea Ghez, a professor of physics and astronomy at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet. We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”In the latest study, the team analysed more than 13,000 observations of the black hole from 133 nights since 2003, gathered by the Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The black hole itself cannot be seen because it acts as a one-way trapdoor even for light. But it is possible to detect radiation blazing from gas and dust just outside the “event horizon” as they are accelerated towards their final fate.The team found that on 13 May the area just outside the black hole’s point of no return was twice as bright as the next brightest observation. They also observed large changes on two other nights this year, with all three of those changes being unprecedented, according to Ghez.The team also used a technique called speckle holography to reanalyse older, fainter observations dating back 24 years, from which they concluded that the level of brightness seen this year was unprecedented in the last quarter of a century.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase … and the rate of gas falling down the black hole drain has increased for an extended period, or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, a professor of physics and astronomy at UCLA and the paper’s co-senior author.One hypothesis is that the feeding frenzy is linked to the closest approach to the black hole of a star called S0-2 during the summer of 2018, and that a large quantity of gas from the star could have reached Sagittarius A* this year.Another possibility involves a bizarre object known as G2, which is most likely a pair of binary stars, which made its closest approach to the black hole in 2014. It is possible the black hole could have stripped off the outer layer of G2, Ghez said, which could help explain the increased brightness just outside the black hole. A third suggestion is that several large asteroids have been drawn into the cosmic sinkhole.The black hole is about 26,000 light years from Earth and poses no danger to our planet. The findings appear in Astrophysical Journal Letters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23cfae1aa5733b8eebcdfe28affe25ddc6c971be/0_0_1745_1047/master/1745.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23689f69b71b18ff667733faba534dd0","title":"ancient australia was home to strange marsupial giants scientists find","story":"Researchers are building a picture of palorchestids, which had tapir-like skulls and large scimitar-like clawsThe “strange” anatomy of a family of giant marsupials that roamed eastern Australia and Tasmania for much of the past 25m years has been revealed in a new study.Scientists had already figured out that palorchestids had tapir-like skulls and large “scimitar-like claws”, but little was known about the limbs of one of the “strangest marsupial lineages to have existed”, according to the paper published by a group of Australian researchers.By examining 60 fossil specimens of palorchestids of varying geologic ages, the scientists were able to get an idea of how their legs and arms would have looked, functioned and evolved over time.They found that the palorchestid had “muscular bent forelimbs” with fixed elbows that were “unlike any of their marsupial kin, living or extinct”, the study published in journal PLOS ONE this week said.“We are beginning to build a picture of the palorchestids as they were in life,” it said.Palorchestids were a sister family to the better-known Diprotodontidae and became extinct some time during the Late Pleistocene, probably as a result of human activity and climatic change.But mystery has surrounded the exact make-up of palorchestids because very few fossils have been found.What is known is that they died out before other mega-fauna, said the Monash university researcher Hazel Richards.“The fact that there just aren’t that many of these guys in the fossil record probably tells us something about the way they were distributed,” Richards told  Australia.“We find them all over Australia but the population size was probably quite small. And they were quite sparsely arranged. It’s not like these guys were travelling in herds or in large numbers as has been kind of hypothesised for some of the other megafauna.”The study found that as they evolved, palorchestids grew larger and stranger. While they varied in size, the researchers said they were “bigger than previously thought, with the largest species likely weighing over 1000 kg”.“We used a method where you take the circumference of the bone and that tells you something about how much weight is being borne through each of the four legs,” Richards said.“We came up with a number that was substantially larger than what has been estimated before and puts them some way up there among some of the the largest marsupials that we ever had in Australia.”The fossils were obtained from museums in Australia and London’s Natural History Museum.“What makes them so weird is the kind of combination of features that they have,” Richards said.“They’ve got an extremely long pointed face, really tiny little eyes, protrusible tongue, something maybe something a bit like a giraffe, and extremely muscular four quarters ... and huge claws.“Some of the other large megafauna ... like diprotodon they’re not as muscular proportionately as ... and also their claws are much smaller. So these guys were clearly specialised for doing something with their four limbs.”Their claws would have been made digging difficult, “like trying to dig with a chef’s knife”, while their elbows, which could not “bend or straighten, are “totally unheard of in any other mammal, living or extinct”.Richards said future research would aim to determine why palorchestids came to be how they were.“The plan now is to zero in and conduct some functional, biomechanical analyses to try and understand exactly what they were adapted for,” she said.“What foods are they targeting, why would they have become so different from everything else?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f04ad03b25a286e672320f2335b5cfff4b99f947/0_134_5504_8122/master/5504.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=58d7b4f0080ad05889ce4d821ce0b8ab 960w","title":"women better than men at disguising autism symptoms","story":"GPs would miss fewer diagnoses if ‘camouflaging’ was better understood, say researchersWomen may not be diagnosed with autism as frequently as men because they are better at hiding the common signs of the condition, according to new research.Some autistic people use strategies to hide traits associated with the condition during social interactions, a phenomenon called social camouflaging. Scientists involved in the study say raising awareness of camouflaging among doctors could help reduce the number of missed autism diagnoses.Scientists studied the results of an online survey designed to measure gender differences in camouflaging in autistic and non-autistic adults. They found autistic women exhibited more camouflaging behaviours than men, which supported previous observations from self-reported studies. No gender camouflaging differences were reported in non-autistic groups.“The effect wasn’t as big as we were expecting,” said Dr Will Mandy, from University College London, one of the authors of the study, published in the journal Autism and presented at the British Science Festival at the University of Warwick.“What I’m finding interesting is how ubiquitous camouflaging is. When you start to dig into why, it’s quite alarming for starters it’s experienced as an obligation rather than a choice. It’s very often about self-preservation, avoiding bullying or attack.”Common camouflaging behaviours include learning how to make eye contact, or suppressing urges to move in physical ways which some autistic people would find comforting, called stimming, for example rocking of the body or flapping of hands.Data from non-binary people and other genders was also studied and no behavioural differences were found, although the sample sizes of these groups were small.“Anyone who is alert to autism won’t be surprised by these findings,” said Hannah Hayward, a researcher on autism in women at King’s College London. “We find that for a lot of females, their autistic traits are not being picked up or recognised in the same way that males have been at school. This is because we’re trying to fit their diagnosis through the same moulds as males, but often they don’t fit that criteria because their presentation is slightly different.Laura Hull, from University College London and also an author on the study, hopes the work will lead to positive change. “If we can get awareness of social camouflaging into the NHS or Nice guidelines, and get it known how common it is in both men and women, that would be so important.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a9274d49050c74d34835cf53d37144ce31a2a7/0_234_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=107b28a2c0ec721d30ce97a11151dbd7","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fifth test day three live","story":"“I am getting under my mum’s feet at home while she looks after my dad who has dementia among his new age-related superpowers. But when I ask him if he would like to listen to the cricket there is a spark in his eyes that is worth any number of Superman capes.” Thanks Ian Copestake. He’s been treated to a good ‘un this summer. The pitch still looks full of runs.Geoff Lemon has had little alternative but to extol the virtues of Steve Smith at regular intervals throughout this series. Yesterday was no exception. Had No 4 been filled by a batsman of similar calibre, Australia might have come to the Oval trailing 4-0. Instead the visitors have had Smith, meaning the fifth Test panned out like the fourth, and the second, and the first. He came to the crease at two down for bugger-all, batted through the departures of his colleagues, then did what he could with the tail.His 80 was his lowest score for the series in six attempts. What has stood out most about this absurdly prolific run is how the atmosphere of an innings has changed every time he has walked in.Jofra Archer fronted the press pack yesterday, a gallery including Ali Martin, who filed this report. Archer, fresh from his second six-wicket haul in only his fourth Test match for England, had noted a difference in how Smith looked at the crease, saying: “It might just be my perception of it but he didn’t look as nailed on as he usually is.” When Smith’s bout of the sniffles was then put to him, the fast bowler replied: “I knew there was something!”Dennis O’Neill might need his own byline after this email. “First, what an extraordinary summer of cricket. The World Cup and an Ashes series that hasn’t once given us a three day result (well, without tempting fate, anyway). It’s been a fantastic series, disappointing result but you can’t have everything. I know we’ve bemoaned the loss of Jimmy Anderson, but we’ve found Jofra Archer and now that Sam Curran seems to have been released from revising for his GCSEs, we could well have two potential replacements for Jimmy and Stuart Broad.” An excellent opening salvo.“I only get to see the highlights, but from what I saw last night, it was good to see the crowd finally giving Steve Smith more cheers than boos. Booing was an ok reaction at first, then it was quite funny but it got really irritating after the third or fourth innings. The point had been made.” Agreed.“He was astonishing and while I know the Aussie bowlers have been immense, England’s bowlers haven’t really let themselves down - if you give Smith the same average as the rest of his team mates, I’m convinced there’s a strong argument for England winning this series 3-1, he’s been that outstanding. I mean, his 80 yesterday was the poorest score of the series? That’s beyond phenomenal and into properly ridiculous.” Yep.“Now to a couple of questions that I’ve never understood about the game. What’s the thinking behind a nightwatchman? If you’re sending someone who’s not a recognised batsman out to face an attack geed up and ready for blood, surely there’s a strong possibility that the nightwatchman won’t last the night, giving the other side a fillip? And even if he does, he’s surely an expected victim early on the following day, giving the other side another psychological boost that there’s one more down cheaply?” Absolutely, and you’ve articulated perfectly why the Australian default (in other words the alpha approach) has long been to avoid them.“And if there is a good argument for that, why did England send out both their regular openers last night? Isn’t the argument for nightwatchmen valid there too? Send out one opener and a nightwatchman or even two nightwatchman?I’m not trying to be sarcastic or snide here, I’m asking out of genuine ignorance.” These are (valid) questions for men and women on a higher pay grade than I.“Next, Denly survived an LBW shout because the ball pitched outside the line - I’ve seen any number of LBWs that have pitched outside the line, but they’ve been given. Again, genuine ignorance of the rules, here. I sometimes struggle with LBW, and I’m someone who can understand the offside rule!” Try this handy video Dennis.Hope that all helps!Sam Curran was always going to be the character columnists were drawn towards after his pugnacious cameo yesterday. Barney Ronay places Curran’s pint-sized potency in the context of Steve Smith serenely dominating the series against an opponent lacking in spite. England will look back at this series and imagine how it might have played without Smith. It might be useful also to imagine what some more of this, a little more needle, a little more concerted aggression might have done to that obsessive, emasculating brilliance.“Hi Jonathan,” hi Rob from Ashford. “It was only recently that I realised that Nathan Lyon’s nickname Garry had derived from a Aussie rules star. I had always assumed it was because of the resemblance of Lyon to the Only Fools and Horses character that the Trotters brought back from France one episode.Here’s to another excellent day!” To an English audience I can imagine it’s an odd one to figure out without an explanation. The whole “Garry” phenomenon exploded when Matthew Wade was behind the stumps and relentlessly bellowing “Niiiiiiice Garrryyyyy!” at every opportunity. Memes abounded (ovs). If you haven’t read Vic Marks’s report from day two at the Oval, what’s wrong with you? Let’s be ‘avin you!The destination of the Ashes has, of course, been decided and that may explain the nature of some of the cricket in this Test so far. Both sides are straining every sinew in the knowledge that the series can still be won or drawn and there are points to be gleaned for the Test Championship. They are all doing their utmost to win. But they cannot always hide their fatigue after this long – and wonderful – summer of cricket.Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of day three of the fifth Ashes Test from the Oval. Unusually for this series the day begins with England in the box seat after a strong bowling and fielding performance yesterday transformed a mediocre first-innings total into a handy lead. There is now the real prospect of England salvaging a draw from the series and maintaining their five-year unbeaten record on home soil.Jofra Archer was England’s star, proving once again that when he is on song he is among the most dangerous bowlers in the world. The challenge for England’s strategists is to ensure the all-format weapon is physically capable of hitting that sort of form regularly, and for Joe Root (or someone in England’s party) to become an Archer whisperer and understand how to coax out those game-changing spells on matchday. But as much as Archer’s six-for dominates the scorebook, the hustle of Sam Curran should not be overlooked. The Surrey allrounder provided some welcome variation to England’s attack with his left-armers but it was his infectious enthusiasm that shone. Diminutive and babyfaced Curran resembled an eager puppy learning how to bare his teeth in sibling combat, but it was long overdue aggression, especially to Steve Smith. It’s a shame Curran has been the only newcomer on display in south London with his youthful exuberance restoring some pep to a line-up that looked weary at Old Trafford. Speaking of Smith, he continued his extraordinary summer with another half-century (natch), but it is a measure of his mind boggling form that 80 is now considered something of a failure. Once again the rest of Australia’s top order struggled, ramming home the point that this series will rightly be remembered as one of the all-time great inidual performances. If you don’t know the drill by now, I’m around for an hour or so but when play begins Adam Collins will take over.

What explains their global success? By  Fatima Bhutto‘The first agreement we should make is: don’t call them soap operas,” Dr Arzu Ozturkmen, who teaches oral history at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, scolds me. “We are very much against this.” What Turkey produces for television are not soap operas, or telenovelas, or period dramas: they are dizi. They are a “genre in progress”, declares Ozturkmen, with unique narratives, use of space and musical scores. And they are very, very popular.Thanks to international sales and global viewership, Turkey is second only to the US in worldwide TV distribution – finding huge audiences in Russia, China, Korea and Latin America. At present, Chile is the largest consumer of dizi in terms of number of shows sold, while Mexico, then Argentina, pay the most to buy them.Dizi are sweeping epics, with each episode usually running to two hours or longer. Advertising time is cheap in Turkey and the state broadcasting watchdog mandates that every 20 minutes of content be broken up by seven minutes of commercials. Every dizi has its own original soundtrack, and can have up to 50 major characters. They tend to be filmed on location in the heart of historic Istanbul, using studios only when they must.Dizi storylines, which have covered everything from gang rape to scheming Ottoman queens, are “Dickens and the Brontë sisters”, I am told by Eset, a young Istanbul screenwriter and film-maker. “We tell at least two versions of the Cinderella story per year on Turkish TV. Sometimes Cinderella is a 35-year-old single woman with a child sometimes she’s a 22-year-old starving actress.” Eset, who worked on perhaps the most famous dizi, Magnificent Century, recounts the narrative themes that dizi are usually loyal to:Dizi are built, Eset insists, on the altar of “communal yearning”, both for the audience and the characters. “We want to see the good guy with the good girl, but, dammit, life is bad and there are bad characters around.”According to Izzet Pinto, the founder of the Istanbul-based Global Agency, which bills itself as the “world’s leading independent TV content distributor for global markets”, the upward course of dizi imperialism began with 2006’s Binbir Gece (1001 Nights). At the time, another Turkish show, Gümüs (Silver), was already a hit in the Middle East, but it was 1001 Nights that became a truly global success. Wherever 1001 Nights was sold – in almost 80 countries – it was a ratings smash.The show featured a blue-eyed Turkish dreamboat, Halit Ergenç, who would go on to star in the lead role of Magnificent Century. Based on the life of Suleiman the Magnificent, the 10th Ottoman Sultan, Magnificent Century told the story of the sultan’s love affair with a concubine named Hurrem, whom he married, in a major break with tradition. A largely unknown historical figure, Hurrem is believed to have been an Orthodox Christian from modern-day Ukraine.When it first aired in Turkey in 2011, Magnificent Century claimed one-third of the country’s TV audience. The foreign press called it an “Ottoman-era Sex and the City” and compared it to a real-life Game of Thrones. It had multiple historical consultants and a production team of 130, with 25 people working on costumes alone.Magnificent Century was so popular in the Middle East that Arab tourism to Istanbul skyrocketed. Turkey’s minister of culture and tourism even stopped charging certain Arab countries broadcasting fees. Global Agency estimates that, even without counting its most recent buyers in Latin America, Magnificent Century has been seen by more than 500 million people worldwide. It was the first dizi bought by Japan. Since 2002, about 150 Turkish dizi have been sold to more than 100 countries, including Algeria, Morocco and Bulgaria. It was Magnificent Century that blazed the way for others to follow.The international success of such dizi is just one sign of the way new forms of mass culture from the east – from Bollywood to K-pop – are challenging the dominance of American pop culture in the 21st century. Ergenç feels that the runaway success of the dizi is partly due to the fact that American TV is entertaining, but not moving. “They don’t touch the feelings that make us human,” he tells me, nursing a cold cup of coffee, when we meet in Istanbul. Turkey’s gaze was once keenly turned to the west, studying its films and television for clues about how to behave in a modern, fast-paced world, but today, American shows offer little guidance. “I was thinking of one American TV series – let’s not say its name. The philosophy of the series was being lonely. Being, um … ” – he searches for the polite word – “multi-partner at the same time, and searching for happiness. And all the people who were watching those series were very excited about it.” I can only guess he is referring to Sex and the City, but Ergenç doesn’t say. “That’s a tiring thing, isn’t it? Being alone, changing partners quickly and searching for happiness, and each time you search for it, it’s a failure. But it was in a very fancy world, so people were very interested. They’re spending and spending – spending their time, spending their love, spending everything.”The dizi that became global behemoths were powered by narratives that pitted traditional values and principles against the emotional and spiritual corruption of the modern world. Fatmagül’ün Suçu Ne? (What Is Fatmagül’s Fault?) centered on the gang rape of a young girl named Fatmagül and her battle for justice. It was a huge hit in Argentina, and in Spain its primetime slot drew close to a million viewers per episode. Fatmagül is soon to get a full Spanish telenovela remake, adapted to a daily, half-hour afternoon format.The show addresses a woman’s place in society, while subjecting her to myriad problems, from forced marriage to tense family relations to the suffocating power of the rich. But Fatmagül perseveres. She educates herself and defeats every hardship as she fights for, and receives, justice on all fronts: civil justice through the nation’s courts, ine justice through the punishment of her violators – and, of course, the justice of true love.Although dizi have dealt with abuse, rape and honour killings, by and large, Turkish men are portrayed as more romantic than Romeo. “They show people what they want to see,” Pinar Celikel, an Istanbul fashion editor tells me. “It’s not real.” Yet Eset argued that Fatmagül was groundbreaking in its approach to women’s issues. Previously, agents of change and the heroes of dizi stories were always men, but “Fatmagül didn’t accept women’s place as being subjugated, almost invisible”.It was such a persuasive vehicle for soft power that in 2012, Eset was hired by a “Republican American thinktank” to write a dizi telling the “good American story” of a woman in the Middle East out to enact positive change, “a woman who softens America’s image”. Eset declines to say which thinktank commissioned him, except to hint that a former Bush administration undersecretary was involved with the institute. “I wrote it,” Eset shrugs as he rolls a cigarette. “But they weren’t able to sell it.”I am standing in the drizzle in a bleak parking lot on the Asian side of Istanbul in front of a white van. A man named Ferhat hands me a Glock 19 pistol. It is the same model Turkish soldiers use, he says, as he swings open the van doors. Inside, there is a rocket-launcher lying on the floor and about 60 other weapons hanging on racks. Ferhat, who is ex-military, pulls out a “bad guy rifle” – an AK-47 – and a sniper rifle. Men in military uniform prowl across the parking lot. All around us there are street signs in Arabic and extras in cheap suits.We are on the set of Söz (The Oath), a new show made by Tims Productions, the company behind Magnificent Century. They are filming episode 38. A demolition expert saunters by, chatting to a man in a balaclava while an actor rehearses a scene, holding a rifle in each hand. Söz is a military dizi – a new sub-genre that is sweeping the nation. Although it is too early to have a sense of its global effect, Söz has already received remake offers from faraway markets including Mexico. Tims has always had an international outlook, I am told. They tried to cast Hollywood stars for Magnificent Century, and were reportedly close to signing Demi Moore to play a European princess until her orce from Ashton Kutcher got in the way.Of the five major channels in Turkey, each has one of these “soldier-glorifying” shows, Eset the screenwriter tells me later, and all the shows are “zeitgeist-relevant”. The baddies are either “internal enemies” or foreign villains. Söz takes place in a Turkey beset by violence and existential threats. Soldiers are everywhere, blazing through the wreckage of suicide bombings at shopping malls and hunting terrorists who are hard at work kidnapping pregnant women. In the first episode, after an attack on a mall, a soldier promises they will not rest until “we drain this swamp” – an eerily familiar refrain.Five minutes on the streets of Istanbul presents multiple encounters with women in headscarves, yet they are nowhere to be seen on screen. “They tried it,” Eset says, “but even the conservative folks don’t like to see conservative women on TV. You can’t get them to kiss, to stand up to their fathers, to run away, to do very much at all that would be considered drama.” Women in hijabs are almost never shown in television adverts, the journalist and novelist Ece Temelkuran tells me. Her diagnosis was clear: “This country is torn between these two pieces of cloth – flag and headscarf.”Back on the Söz set, as we move upstairs to a cold office building to watch a man pick up a phone for an hour while the demolition guys shoot glass windows in the corridor, I tell Selin Arat – director of international operations at Tims, and my guide for the day – that I watched an episode of Söz the previous night. Every time I looked down at my notebook, I explain, by the time I looked up again, everyone in the scene seemed to have been murdered. Who are the terrorists supposed to be? Arat, a delicate, strawberry-blond woman in a business suit, laughs. “It would be life-threatening if we knew who they were,” she jokes.Whoever the terrorists are, Söz is a hit. “It’s the first Turkish show that has surpassed one million subscribers on YouTube,” Arat notes proudly. Selling Söz outside Turkey may prove tougher, though. “We do want this show to be global,” says Timur Savcı, the founder of Tims Productions. “But right now not many countries are really interested in watching Turkish soldiers be glorified.” He pauses and smiles. “The US always makes shows and, at the end, they say: ‘God bless America.’ Well, God bless Turkey!”Savcı sits at his desk in the Levent district of Istanbul, as five TVs, all tuned to different channels, illuminate his spacious office. He sets the tone for the dizi industry at large and, today, he is preparing an English adaptation of Magnificent Century. He is not the least bit interested in taking American shows and remaking them in Turkish. “We are just making originals. It’s better!” he says with a big laugh.Dizi have yet to penetrate the English-speaking world. That could be because audiences in the US and UK don’t like to watch subtitled shows, Savcı muses, “or it could be the fact that this is about an Islamic state at the end of the day.” I ask if that is something Tims would tone down in the English version of Magnificent Century? Savcı, a jaunty, jovial man, shakes his head. “It’s important to remember that, at the time, the Ottoman Empire was the superpower of the world. What the US is now to the world is what the Ottoman was. If people look at it from this perspective, they would understand it more, but if they don’t know this, they would feel threatened.”Turks have been watching quality US TV since the 1970s. Turkish actors, such as Mert Fırat, told me they learned all their chops from the likes of Dallas and Dynasty. That was where they learned to emote, and to perform the melodrama that dizi require. But there was something lacking, something fundamental missing from those early guides to how to be rich and powerful in the modern world.Kivanç Tatlıtuğ, the star of the hit dizi Gümüs, among others, doesn’t feel it is necessarily a question of values or conservatism, but empathy. Over email, he told me why he thinks audiences around the world are turning to dizi over western productions. “Most of these audiences feel that their everyday stories are ‘underexplored’ by Hollywood and Europe,” Tatlıtuğ wrote. “This is ultimately a matter of ersity in storytelling. I understand the appeal of a story like Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones, these are both amazing TV shows. However, some people may also feel disenfranchised from these Hollywood themes, and may want to watch a story they can empathise with.”At the time of our meeting, Eset is working with a Turkish-American production house, Karga 7, which has global ambitions for their shows.“When I talk to people about Turkish TV series,” he tells me, “mainly they are taken by this romantic notion of family where everyone is trying to cherish one another. The dangers are external, and socio-economic class plays a great role in the love story of the poor boy loving a rich girl, or vice versa. Normally a story like this in the west would be treated through an inidual’s journey, where there is more sex, there is more violence, there are drugs.” Turkish TV has less of that. He points out that the couple in Fatmagül don’t kiss until about episode 58.In August 2017 in Beirut, I speak to Fadi Ismail, the general manager of the Middle East Broadcasting Center’s subsidiary O3 Productions, and the person responsible for bringing Turkish television to the Middle East. “To brag a bit,” Ismail corrects me with a laugh, “I’m the one who opened Turkish culture through TV to the whole world.” MBC is the biggest broadcaster in the Middle East and North Africa, home to almost 400 million people. MBC has a news channel, a children’s channel, a women’s channel, a Bollywood channel and a 24-hour drama channel on which it broadcasts Egyptian soaps, Korean dramas and Latin American telenovelas.In 2007, Ismail went to a buyer’s cinema festival in Turkey and chanced upon a tiny kiosk showing a local television series. “I stopped and watched it, not understanding anything,” he remembers. “But immediately I could visualise it as Arabic content. I replaced it in my mind with Arabic audio and everything else looked culturally, socially – even the food, the clothes, everything for me looked like us, and I thought: ‘Eureka!’”Ismail bought a Turkish series for his channel. He doesn’t remember the name of that first show, because they had already hit on the formula of giving everything – the title, the characters – new Arabic names. “Every one of these titles had ‘love’ in it, so I stopped differentiating. Love Something, Blue Love, Long Love, Short Love, Killing Love.” Gümüs – renamed Noor for the Middle East market – was the first big hit. Although the Egyptians had traditionally been known for their cinema, they also dominated TV across the region until Syria took over in the 1990s. Syrian actors were renowned for their dramatic and comedic skills. Their directors were artists. Talented scriptwriters produced shows of quality with substantial state help. The government poured money into the television industry, providing auteurs with cameras, equipment, state subsidies and permission to film in Syria’s historic sites. But then the war broke out and the country’s bright promise flickered. It was at this moment, Ismail says, that the Turks were ready to move in.As Syrian dramas had already become a “pan-Arab phenomenon”, MBC decided to dub all the Turkish dramas they bought into the Syrian Arabic dialect. “That is one of the reasons for their huge success,” Ismail concludes. “We dubbed the Turkish dramas with the most prevalent and established drama accent: Syrian.” Before Turkish dramas flooded Middle Eastern screens, people in Lebanon watched Mexican and Brazilian telenovelas. Though they were popular, they eventually ran out of steam for two reasons. The first was language. Telenovelas were dubbed into fusha, a standardised literary Arabic that is understood from Iraq to Sudan, and is used in newspapers, magazines and newscasts. Free from local accents and slang particular to each country, it is a formal, classical Arabic.The second was a question of values. “The Mexicans really did not resemble us at all,” says Imane Mezher, the format distribution and licensing coordinator of iMagic, a Beirut-based TV production company. iMagic makes Arabs Got Talent and the Middle East version of the X Factor, and experiments with new formats such as World Bellydance Championship, and an Islamically approved Extreme Makeover in which contestants don’t alter God’s design out of vanity, but have reconstructive surgery due to life-threatening issues.Mezher shakes her head at the memory of the telenovelas. “You have a daughter and you don’t know who her father is, you don’t know who the mother is. The stories were moral-free. At the end of the day, like it or not, we like things to be a little more conservative. The Turks are amazing at that. They are the real mix: the European freedom that everyone longs for and, at the same time, the problems are conservative, the same we face. The people have the same names as us, the same stories as us, and people love that.”Yet over the past 18 months, the international reach of Turkish TV has been significantly curtailed. At 1am, Saudi Arabian time on 2 March 2018, MBC took dizi off the air. Six dizi were pulled, at a cost to MBC of $25m. “There is a decision to remove all Turkish drama from several TV outlets in the region,” the channel’s spokesman said. “I can’t confirm who took the decision.”Since 2015, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had been in negotiations to buy MBC, but found the $3bn asking price too high. In November 2017, MBS, as he is known, arrested most of MBC’s board and shareholders as part of what was billed as an anti-corruption sweep. After an 83-day stay in a luxury jail, MBC’s founder Waleed bin Ibrahim Al Ibrahim, a Saudi businessman whose sister was married to a former king, was released. His company now had a secret new majority owner, whose first order of business was to cancel all of MBC’s dizi programming.Before then, the Middle East and North Africa region accounted for the largest international consumption of dizi. Magnificent Century was advertised alongside Game of Thrones and Oprah in Dubai, while Ece Yörenç – Fatmagül’s scriptwriter – was asked by Saudi Arabia to write TV series for its local channels, and rumours circulated of princes and politicians inquiring after show plotlines during state visits to Turkey. It is possible that this kind of Turkish soft power irked MBS. And it is certain that he was infuriated by Turkey’s brazen flouting of his 2017 blockade of Qatar. Thus, in March 2018, MBS accused Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, of trying to build a new “Ottoman caliphate”, included Turkey in what he bizarrely called a “triangle of evil”, and swiftly erased dizi from Middle Eastern TV.It is impossible to separate politics, both internal and geopolitical, from dizi’s upward momentum. Erdoğan himself was famously antagonistic to Magnificent Century, finding it too risque and not sufficiently versed in true Ottoman history. His government withdrew permission for its producers to film in historical sites such as Topkapı Palace, and Turkish Airlines pulled it from its in-flight entertainment systems in order to avoid government ire. A deputy from Erdoğan’s AKP party even went so far as to submit a parliamentary petition to legally ban the show.Although Magnificent Century has never been used by the state to project Turkish soft power to the world, other dizi have. Two more recent productions for TRT, Turkish state television, have the government’s wholehearted endorsement, if not their guidance. The first, Diriliş: Ertuğrul, or Resurrection: Ertuğrul, begins at the start of Ottoman glory, with Ertuğrul Ghazi, the father of Sultan Osman, the founder of the empire. The dizi’s tagline is “A nation’s awakening”, and for five seasons viewers have watched Ertuğrul battle crusaders, Mongols, Christian Byzantines and more. It has the honour of being the most popular show to air on state TV. “Until the lions start writing their own stories,” Erdoğan said of Ertuğrul, “their hunters will always be the heroes.”Another show, Payitaht Abdülhamid or The Last Emperor, bookends the Ottoman obsession: it is based on the last powerful Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid II. It first aired in 2017, drawing in big numbers – every Friday, one in 10 television watchers tuned in as the sultan staved off rebellions by the Young Turks (who would eventually unseat him) and scheming European powers. Both supporters and detractors of the dizi pointed out that its portrayal of the sultan was modelled incredibly closely on Erdoğan. Followers of the Turkish president saw symbiosis between the two proud leaders who were unafraid to confront the west, and who dreamed of making Turkey central to pan-Muslim unity. Critics pointed out the two men’s paranoid reliance on intelligence services and an oppressive grip on power.By 2023, the Turkish government hopes dizi will pull in $1bn from exports. In his Istanbul glass office, İzzet Pinto, the founder of dizi distributor Global Agency, told me that $500m is a more realistic target given the loss of the Middle East market. But he foresees that remake rights, expansion in Latin America and the opening of western Europe – notably Italy and Spain – will help offset those losses.Over at Tims, Selin Arat predicts that Turkish series have reached a stable level of popularity. Demand might not grow much more, but there is a global hunger for what Turkish TV can offer. Arat concedes that the Saudi stance against dizi is a setback, but, he says: “It won’t be the end of the Turkish dizi invasion.”Adapted from New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K-Pop by Fatima Bhutto, published on 10 October by Columbia Global Reports, and available at bookshop• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977a299c6ac7e334380c9dc7d44f6923ce86812a/0_9_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd832770c9cea0ac2544e670543a087b","title":"tv streaming bonanza looms for uk but can you afford it","story":"Services from Apple, Britbox, HBO and Disney launch soon – but to get them all would cost £1,450 a yearTelevision viewers who want to watch a range of sport and popular shows, including Premier League and Champion’s League football, dramas such as The Crown, Line of Duty and Chernobyl, archive shows such as Gavin and Stacey and new content based on the Star Wars and Marvel franchises, face having to pay more than £120 a month by this time next year.The global streaming phenomenon, that so far has been all about Netflix, and to a lesser extent its rival Amazon’s Prime Video, is about to get a whole lot more complicated – and expensive – as a new wave of subscription streaming services join the battle to win over TV fans.Apple is launching its service, Apple TV+, on 1 November while Disney is launching its own service less than two weeks later.By the end of the year ITV and the BBC will introduce Britbox, which will offer a best-of-British experience from Victoria to Love Island.Next year will herald the arrival of two more US-based streaming services, HBO Max and NBCUniversal. The new services are a part of a move by film studios and TV programme makers to sell their output direct to consumers, rather than through a service provider such as Netflix.Each service will have separate content and those wanting to watch will have to sign up to a monthly subscription or annual fee.The change means viewers will have to pay for multiple services to access the content they want, on top of fees for satellite and cable TV and the TV licence fee that funds the BBC.HBO Max is part of Warner Media, which owns the film studio behind Lord of The Rings and Harry Potter, the DC Comics superheros including Batman and Superman, and HBO shows including Big Little Lies. In the US, Warner Media has taken back the rights to Friends, dealing a major blow to Netflix. The long-running saga is the most-watched show on Netflix.Sky-owner Comcast will launch the NBCUniversal streaming service, taking back another big Netflix hit in the US version of The Office. It also owns the Universal film studio behind the Jurassic World and Fast and the Furious franchises.The monthly bills of these two services in the UK have not yet been set, but they are likely to be £6-£8 a month – although Sky customers will get the NBCUniversal service either for free or at a very low cost.The details of Apple’s new streaming service were unveiled last week. The mobile phone giant is selling fewer phones and expanding into services that customers will pay for every month rather than rely on big ticket phone purchases every two or three years.Apple has earmarked $6bn to produce original programming over the next few years to make its service a must-watch. Star attractions will include Jennifer Aniston in her first TV series since Friends, a comedy-drama called The Morning Show with fellow A-listers Reece Witherspoon and Steve Carrell. The service will cost £4.99 a month, but be free for the first year for owners of Apple devices.Disney’s service, Disney+, will officially launch on 12 November and is likely to start in the UK early next year, priced at £5.99 a month. It will offer content including the Star Wars films and original $100m TV series The Mandalorian the Marvel universe, again including exclusive TV series spin-offs Pixar films and family fare from Toy Story to Frozen plus TV hits such as The Simpsons.Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have amassed 240 million subscribers worldwide, with almost 20 million in the UK, with little opposition. The new services are roughly half the cost of Netflix, and designed to be cheap enough to crack the global duopoly without breaking the bank for viewers.The £5.99-a-month Britbox will mostly offer archive shows, with some original commissions but without the budget of its international competitors. Richard Broughton of media research firm Ampere Analysis said Britbox could struggle to find viewers willing to pay. “While the different streaming services are not all competing for the same audiences, Britbox is facing a bit of an uphill struggle because it is largely relying on a lot of content that has historically been watched free-to-air.”When the next wave of services launch viewers will find they have never been so spoiled for choice, but the price of being able to enjoy all the best shows, films and sport on offer could add up to a wallet-busting £1,500 a year.“It would be difficult for many households to justify spending £1,500 a year, it is higher than many rent and mortgage payments around the country,” said Broughton. “We suspect people will enter an era of switching from one service to another and back again when they spot new shows or get bored.”Ampere reckons that there is space for a number of streaming services to do relatively well, attracting 1 to 2 million subscribers each, but Netflix and Amazon will remain the two biggest players over the long term.“It is both a golden age of TV but also potentially nearing peak TV,” said Broughton. “There is far more content than anyone can hope to consume and with the costs involved the big question is whether it is sustainable.”Sky TV £22 a month, £264 annually.

They’ve been hardest hit Holidaymakers queuing at immigration at the Bahamas’ Nassau airport are still serenaded by three pink-shirted men playing jovial music. They are still sunbathing on the beaches and still swimming in the sea. It is as if nothing has changed in paradise.Yet 40 minutes away by plane, on the Abaco Islands, heaven turns to hell. The Mudd, a shantytown that was home to the Bahamas’ biggest Haitian immigrant community, has been obliterated by Hurricane Dorian as if by a massive bomb.On Thursday a bare, crooked tree reminiscent of a desert wasteland was one of the few things still standing. Every dwelling had been destroyed. Cars were overturned. The ground was a wasteland strewn with blankets, clothes, fridges, shoes, rusty nails, splintered plywood, toilets and toothbrushes. The size of several football pitches, the Mudd was peopleless no one knows how many died here and how many evacuated.Natural disasters often expose the gap between the haves and have nots and Dorian was no different. While the Bahamas has a reputation as one of the most desirable tourist destinations on earth, its luxury hotels and homes depend on a life support system of fishermen, hotel workers and laborers. Once again, it is the poorest who have been hardest hit when catastrophe strikes.“We’ve brought this on ourselves,” was one opinion conveyed anonymously to the . “It’s all fine when you’re living in paradise and a Haitian comes and mows your lawn. We’ve just created our own structure and there hasn’t been any attempt to integrate.”The Mudd was built by thousands of Haitian immigrants over decades in Marsh Harbour on Abaco. But it was wiped out in hours, its flimsy wooden structures standing little chance against the wrath of Dorian. American emergency workers have found five bodies in the debris and expect more to come.Others fled and are unaccounted for. Some have evacuated by boat to Nassau. Some sought refuge in places such as the pink-walled New Haitian Mission Baptist church. At one point 210 Haitians gathered on its bare concrete floor, without electricity or running water. Now there are 45, including two children.Charles Ilfrenord, its pastor, who moved from Haiti 35 years ago but still has family there, said: “Plenty of people died in the Mudd. I think more than 1,000.”Jean Claude Timothy, 41, a builder and electrician who lived next to the Mudd, recalled helping his wife and children into the attic of their house as water rose 25ft high. “A trailer knocked the roof right off. I had to swim to get a boat to put my family in. We pulled it slowly down the road for a half a mile.”The family were temporarily blinded by fumes from a nearby oil and diesel plant, Timothy added, but they found shelter in a government building. Timothy’s wife, 31-year-old Kenya, and their four children were evacuated by a boat that was taking women and children only. Timothy is now sleeping rough in a roofless building and struggling for food. “We’re just waiting for jobs and for something to do,” he said.“Everybody’s been hit, the rich and the poor, but for the rich it’s less severe because they live in better buildings. The people you work for for years don’t send a private plane for you. You worked for them for years but they don’t give you any food, any vacation pay.”Tourism employs about half the Bahamian workforce and accounts for around half GDP. Abaco is renowned for its marinas, golf courses and all-inclusive resorts. Even now, a leaflet at Nassau airport advertises the Abaco Beach Resort, including “a boating paradise unlike any other”. Glen Kelly, its harbour master, told the Washington Post: “I’ll put it as raw as I can. We’ve always depended on Haitian labour, legal or illegal, to maintain this place. Now it’s a question of whether they’ll be back.”Paradise comes at a social, economic and moral cost. The Bahamas has the second highest economic and social inequality in the Caribbean, according to the Latin American Economic Outlook 2019 Report. An editorial in the Nassau  newspaper in 2017 warned: “Economic inequality is killing the Bahamas.” As Hurricane Dorian approached, affluent people were able to get out early whereas the poor had to remain and try to ride it out.Lydia Ruth Hill, 38, a vacation planner and property manager, was one of only seven people who stayed behind in a neighborhood of more than 200. She had no sleep for 48 hours as she searched for missing people in the rubble two of her relatives are still unaccounted for. She is now setting up a recovery command center but is inundated with messages from those who left and are worried about their possessions.“They were just really inconsiderate requests when we were on survival mode here and then people mouthing off at us when we said that we don’t have time to do that. At that point I was still trying to get critical care people off the island.”Nearly two weeks after Dorian made landfall, at least 50 deaths have been reported, more than 1,300 people are missing and an estimated 15,000 are without food or shelter. Many in the underclass lost everything.Earl Arthurs, the operations specialist for the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency, said: “Any disaster, the poor people will be the ones that are punished. A poor person owns a small house and it’s not insured so when the hurricane comes and it’s washed away, that’s it. A rich person owns a nice mansion and it gets totaled but he gets money to build a new one. So that’s a big difference.“Some of these people are living from hand to mouth, weekly pay cheque, so when something like this happens and they cannot work, they will definitely be dependent on government for support.”There are concerns that undocumented Haitian immigrants may be reluctant to seek government aid lest they be penalized and deported. Arthurs said: “In every country, including the United States, people are scared to come out and register during crisis time, because after the crisis is finished they fear that they probably have enough information on them to go and pick them up and deport them.”Paul Taylor, the operations response manager of Team Rubicon UK, an NGO working with partners to coordinate and distribute aid, added: “As ever, there are people who do the work that the rich people don’t want to do and here that’s the Haitian community. There are lot of illegals here as well.“I think the issue now is what happens to people who don’t have any status here, who might be quite concerned about that. You’ve got to evacuate people from the islands – big reconstruction job – but where do those people go?”The government of the Bahamas denies that Haitians will be treated differently."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82c61f4e99a4b242b05d2a2188e23fa2eea04848/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2f1b81d772134fc3eba4d2d72bdd7a6","title":"juan guaido faces questions over links to organised groups","story":"Opposition leader plays down images but analysts say they could prove highly damagingJuan Guaidó, the Venezuelan politician fighting to topple Nicolás Maduro, is facing awkward questions about his relationship with organised crime after the publication of compromising photographs showing him with two Colombian paramilitaries.In an interview on Friday, Guaidó played down the significance of the pictures, in which he posed alongside two members of the Colombian criminal gang the Rastrojos identified as El Brother and El Menor.The photos appear to have been taken on 22 February as Guaidó used an illegal border crossing to sneak across Venezuela’s western border into Colombia to attend a Live Aid-style concert in the town of Cúcuta.“I took hundreds of photos that day,” Guaidó told the Colombian broadcaster Blu Radio. “It was hard to know who was asking for a photo. Misconstruing these photos means playing the Maduro regime’s game.”On Friday Venezuela’s state prosecutor’s office said it would open an investigation into the photos. Analysts said the images had the potential to cause severe harm to Guaidó’s credibility and his nine-month quest to force Maduro from power.The Rastrojos are a drug-trafficking group with paramilitary origins who operate on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border. As well as the cocaine trade, they are engaged in illegal mining, kidnapping for ransom and extortion.Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group, said: “I think it is extremely damaging. Regardless of whether this was as innocent as they claim – which is rather hard to believe – or whether there was something more to it, it looks so bad.”Gunson said the photos handed “a huge propaganda victory” to Maduro’s government, which is fending off accusations of ties to leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers.Maduro sought to exploit the scandal on Thursday, claiming the images were definitive evidence of Guaidó’s ties to “paracos, murderers and narco-traffickers”.In a televised speech, Maduro declared: “The connection between Colombian narco-trafficking and the Venezuelan right is right there in the photo. No one can deny it.”Gunson said that whatever the truth, the photos showed “unbelievable naivety” and were an embarrassment to the international coalition backing Guaidó, which includes the US, Colombia, Brazil and the UK.“It could almost not have come at a worse time for Guaidó,” Gunson said, pointing to the Colombian government’s plans to denounce Maduro’s ties to leftist guerrillas at the UN general assembly later this month.The photos were published on Thursday by Wilfredo Cañizales, the director of a human rights group in Cúcuta, where February’s highly politicised concert was held.Speaking to the , Cañizales claimed the Rastrojos had imposed a curfew along the border before Guaidó’s crossing into Colombia “to make sure no locals would take photos of him crossing illegally through the hidden paths”.Cañizales declined to say how he had obtained the photos or why he had decided to publish them but said: “The Rastrojos are paramilitaries. They are the ones in this region who decide who lives and who dies.”Gunson said the photos also posed uncomfortable questions for Guaidó’s backers in the Colombian government and their possible links with paramilitary groups. “There’s a lot of questions that haven’t been answered,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62c84534d56d2e9bed9974674d7bb54e1c83f71a/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b9a77395a452082df6ead360f242bf","title":"judge who convicted geoffrey boycott i stand by my verdict","story":"‘I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,’ says French judge The French judge who convicted Geoffrey Boycott of assaulting his girlfriend has criticised the former England cricketer after he was knighted and says she stands by her decision to find him guilty.The move to award Boycott the honour prompted outrage this week from a domestic violence charity. He was convicted in 1998 of assaulting Margaret Moore, who was left with black eyes after he hit her 20 times.Boycott, who has always denied the offence, said he “couldn’t give a toss” about criticism over Theresa May awarding him a knighthood, and cast doubt on the credibility of French justice.But after being tracked down by the  in Alsace, Dominique Haumant, who presided over trial, said she did not believe Boycott’s denial and that his conduct during the court case had been “arrogant” and “deplorable”.“I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen,” she said. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. Now that I’m really shocked at. He doesn’t deserve it.“As far as French justice is concerned, he has been found guilty of having beaten his partner three times.”The retired judge said: “I remember this case very well and I remember the row about it even after 20 years. I saw all the photos, the evidence, the statements and if I didn’t think he was guilty I wouldn’t have convicted him.” Boycott was fined £5,300 and given a three-month suspended jail sentence, upheld by a second court on appeal. He was also ordered to pay a symbolic one franc in compensation to Moore.The 78-year-old former England captain, who has been commentating for Channel 5 and BBC Radio 5 Live during this summer’s Ashes series, has always denied the charges and claimed Moore was a “woman scorned” exacting her revenge.“Boycott was most definitely not a gentleman,” Haumant said. “He told one of the opposing lawyers to shut up during the hearing. That was extremely vulgar and not something you say during a hearing. I can’t imagine a judge in your country allowing that, and I wouldn’t allow it.”“He claimed it was an accident, but, as I say, if I convicted him it was because I thought he was guilty and I stand by that. He appealed and my judgment was upheld by the appeal court.“It is more than 20 years ago, but I still remember his behaviour in the courtroom. He was arrogant and he had a deplorable attitude throughout the trial.”After he was convicted in the court in Grasse, on the Côte d’Azur, Boycott took a swipe at the French judge, saying he was not entirely surprised to be found guilty “in view of the way the trial was conducted”. He claimed that unlike the UK, the legal system in France rested on the principle of “guilty until proven innocent”.He said he did not care about condemnation of his honour from a leading domestic violence charity. Responding to Adina Claire, the co-acting chief executive of Women’s Aid, who described his knighthood as part of former prime minister Theresa May’s resignation honours list as “extremely disappointing”, Boycott told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme presenter Martha Kearney: “I don’t give a toss about her, love.”The French legal system, like the British, is based on the principle that a defendant is innocent until proven guilty. All but the most serious crimes and offences, those carrying a prison sentence of 10 years or more, are tried without a jury.People are not “charged” with a crime or offence in France, they are “put under investigation”. Before the case comes to trial, an investigating magistrate known as a juge d’instruction tells police to collect evidence and takes witness statements to produce a case file to determine whether an offence has been committed.If the magistrate decides there is no charge to answer, the case is classé, or dropped. If the magistrate decides there is a case to answer, the person is sent to trial and the file, available to the lawyers of all interested parties, is presented to the trial judge.There were three hearings in the Moore v Boycott case. He was first convicted of assault in January 1998 by judge Marc Juando at a court in Grasse. He was not present for the hearing and appealed successfully to have the verdict set aside. Haumant presided over a second trial in Grasse in November 1998 that confirmed the verdict of the first. Boycott appealed and a panel of three judges upheld the conviction in May 2000.The November 1998 trial was long and at times chaotic. Boycott was said to have flown 13 witnesses to the south of France at an estimated cost of more than £200,000, but many appeared to have nothing to say directly about the accusations. They included a psychiatrist who had never met Moore but gave his interpretation of her behaviour from television clips and conversations with her former husband.Haumant remembers sitting until the early hours of the morning hearing witnesses, many of them appearing for Boycott, all of whose testimony had to be translated. “It was a long trial, but then there were a lot of witnesses, most of them for the defendant,” she said.The verdict in January had been set aside because Boycott failed to turn up to the brief hearing, explaining he was on tour commentating on Test matches in South Africa.Boycott and Moore were staying at the Hotel du Cap in Antibes in October 1996 when they argued. Moore was reported to have become even more furious when she returned to their hotel room to find Boycott packing for an early flight back to the UK.He claimed she had slipped in the ensuing fracas while throwing his clothing and belongings out of the window.Moore said he had attacked her, holding her to the ground and staring at her with “wild, piercing and manic” eyes as he hit her.In her seven-page written explanation of her verdict, Haumant, who told British journalists covering the trial that her hero was the suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, made it clear she was not impressed with Boycott’s behaviour in or out of court.“In the court, the accused didn’t hesitate to interrupt Mrs Moore’s lawyer rudely, tarnishing the image of the perfect gentleman which he brought his old friends and witnesses to testify to,” she wrote at the time. She said the evidence presented to the court “does not support the theory of an accidental fall” and ruled that Moore had been the victim of “purposeful blows”.Boycott accused Moore of blackmailing him to settle for a large sum of money, but she said it was never about cash. She asked for and was awarded the symbolic one franc damages. Boycott, labelled a woman-beater and criminal, found it difficult to shake off the stain on his reputation, even when Moore’s former solicitor Sue Sims-Steward said Moore saw Boycott as a way of solving financial problems and portrayed the victim as a difficult woman who could “turn on the tears at will”.“It’s no surprise to me that he’s been given an honour,” said Haumant. “I remember reading a profile of Theresa May in the French magazine l’Express when she said her great idol was not the Beatles or the Rolling Stones, but Geoffrey Boycott.“On the other hand it is surprising because of what he did,” she said.“I was heavily criticised for my judgment to the point I worried that I’d better not go to the UK because I wouldn’t be safe in the street. I remember an article that made fun of me for not knowing anything about cricket, but why would I?”A spokesman for Boycott did not comment."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Driver stopped on M1 motorway after garda\u0026iacute noticed car moving erraticallyFinancial and environmental concerns raised with Minister for TransportLorries need parking near Dublin Airport in case congestion blocks port \u0026ndash industryMilitary leaders fear strikes as Congress set to consider application by PDforraReport warns of dangers of funding shortfalls at a time of rising levels of obesitySenior FG figures claim even considering idea may help \u0026lsquorehabilitate\u0026rsquo the OppositionFine Gael seeks to put family-friendly policies at the centre of their bid for a third termJim Shannon said party was looking at \u0026lsquopractical methods\u0026rsquo to allow Brexit dealGrowhouse with heating and lighting systems discovered in Cappamore\u0026lsquoThey\u0026rsquore a good Kerry team but not great,\u0026rsquo says one brave, fate-tempting supporterResult prompts calls for an overhaul in how the Government carries out its own fundingProcessing plant in North approved to supply retailers with Republic reared meat35-year-old arrested in Co Louth on Friday on foot of European Arrest Warrant issued by Northern Ireland authoritiesTaoiseach says Higgins\u0026rsquos comments on sufficient remuneration extend to all of societyIrish Refugee and Migrant Coalition also urges new Mediterranean search and rescueByrne claims cannabis possession in Ireland derailed efforts to secure legal status in USMeeting seen as unlikely to produce substantive movement on BrexitTwo of Kerry\u0026rsquos top stars, Stephen O\u0026rsquoBrien and Se\u0026aacuten O\u0026rsquoShea, play with Kenmare Shamrocks"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017580.1568404110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar remarks about potential future ff coalition criticised","story":" Political Editor Pat Leahy reports from the Fine Gael pre Dáil parliamentary party think-in at Garryvoe in east Cork where Brexit and the budget are high on the agenda.

Photograph: Eamonn FarrellRollingNews.ieIt was claimed by senior Fine Gael figures that such statements could help “rehabilitate” the Opposition party.The Taoiseach made his comments about future co-operation with Fianna Fáil at the conclusion of the two-day Fine Gael parliamentary party think-in in Garryvoe, Co Cork.When asked if he would consider a so-called “grand coalition” after the election, Mr Varadkar said: “I would. Essentially any general election is going to depend on the result. Any general election is going to depend on the results.“My intention and expectation is that we win the election as the largest party again.We form a government and we head a coalition. But I am certainly not ruling out any future arrangement with Fianna Fáil. Either confidence and supply or coalition.”Fine Gael first offered a grand coalition to Fianna Fáil during the lengthy process of government formation after the 2016 general election. Enda Kenny’s offer was declined by Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin at the time.Next electionHowever, Mr Varadkar said he would not underpin a Fianna Fáil-led minority government unless Mr Martin wins more seats than him at the next election. It means he would not facilitate Mr Martin’s election as taoiseach if Fianna Fáil, the Greens, Labour and others formed a coalition in a situation where Fine Gael was the largest party in the Dáil.“We certainly would not entertain a situation whereby we were the largest party in the Dáil and we were then somehow asked to facilitate the second and fourth and fifth party forming a government,” Mr Varadkar said.“Let there be no doubt about this. It is my intention and my plan and my expectation that Fine Gael will win the next election when it comes in May 2020.“We will be the largest party and as the largest party we will do what the largest party always does, which is seek to form a government. Ideally a coalition government with a majority.“While confidence and supply has worked reasonably well for just over three years now, a majority government would be better for the country and that’s what I want us to be in a position to do.”Reckless vs rehabilitationSome TDs and Ministers privately said they disagreed with the Taoiseach making the comments, claiming Fine Gael had spent its think-in describing Fianna Fáil as “reckless” only for Mr Varadkar to raise the prospect of bringing them back into government.“We shouldn’t be doing anything to rehabilitate them,” said one Minister, adding that if Fianna Fáil won the next election then questions would be asked about Mr Varadkar’s own position as leader.“If we don’t win the next election, who is to say it’ll be Leo Varadkar’s call?”One TD said that while Fine Gael first offered a grand coalition in 2016, it “wasn’t an indefinite offer”.The Taoiseach stressed he wanted to lead Fine Gael even if the party lost the next election.“Our party rules are there for anyone to see. If after an election we are not forming a government then there is a ballot of Oireachtas members as to whether they want me to continue or not. But I will want to continue in that circumstance.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4017429.1568414510!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we have all nationalities in oughterard as it is","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Connemara Gateway Hotel, Oughterard: The  Department of Justice  cannot confirm or deny if any building is being considered for direct provision. Photograph: Joe O’Shaughnessy Anyone who has travelled from Galway to the mountains of north Connemara will have passed the Connemara Gateway Hotel, just north of Oughterard. It has become better known in recent days.It has been there for more than half a century, a dominant feature on the left hand side of the road, near the local golf course, about 2km shy of the town itself. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was a motel in the US-style, with outside balconies leading to each door. In the 1980s, it was remodelled by Galway hotelier Charlie Synnott, giving it a more conventional, if sprawling look.For a long while, it was successful. Later it changed hands and fell on leaner times before closing. For more than a decade now it has lain idle, looking increasingly neglected and overgrown. Several weeks ago, locals noticed construction workers had moved in. Inquiries brought little information from the owner or the workers. Suspicions were raised. Building works usually do not begin as the tourist season dies.“There was a lack of information,” says local councillor Tom Welby. “We contacted the Department of Justice and they would tell us nothing. We put two and two together,” he said.Oughterard is a postcard-picture town about 20km from Galway City on the banks of Lough Corrib and a haven for trout anglers, particularly in May when the mayflies dance.A dormitory town for Galway Oughterard went into decline for a long period but in the past decade has recovered somewhat. The population is not large, about 1,300. It has two national schools, only one local doctor, and a secondary school, St Paul’s, a strong basketball nursery. GAA is big, too – recently-retired Galway manager Kevin Walsh hails from nearby Killanin. Welby and some others were worried that a direct provision centre would become a fait accompli. Faced with questions about Oughterard, or anywhere else, the Department of Justice offers standard replies.It cannot confirm or deny if any building is being considered, since it takes the view that it is legally precluded from saying anything until the tender process is over and contracts are signed. It’s only then that consultation can begin, it argues. “That’s no good. At that stage it’s a done deal,” argues Welby. “There will be no point. We will be told the centre is there and how many people it will cater for.”Welby and a few others organised a public meeting. Originally, it was to be in the Boat Inn, a local pub but a Facebook page generated so much interest that it moved to the local community centre. In the end, 800 people came.Grealish commentsLocals have real concerns. If 250 arrive, that would be a fifth of Oughterard’s population. Two large direct provision centres have existed without controversy in Galway for more than a decade, but it has a population of 80,000. It would be harder for a small town to absorb so many people overnight.The meeting became highly emotional and visceral, illustrated by local Independent TD Noel Grealish’s outburst that African asylum seekers are economic migrants sponging off the system. However, Grealish, a former Progressive Democrat TD, was called out strongly for his anti-immigrant comments at the meeting by another Galway West TD Catherine Connolly. Moycullen-based Fine Gael TD Seán Kyne, now the Government Chief Whip, was met with loud boos when he argued that initial opposition elsewhere had turned to support once the centres started up.Incidentally, the person who videoed and tweeted Grealish’s comments was Gearóid Murphy, who is involved in a campaign against what he calls mass immigration and direct provision centres nationally. Grealish’s speech, including his incendiary comments, got a thunderous round of applause. Since then, many locals have privately praised him, saying he had spoken “straight”.Oughterard has a history of protest. Thirty years ago, it met the attempt to impose a rod licence on anglers with a long and stubborn boycott that lasted for two years, bitterly iding town and almost crippling it economically. Does all of this translate into a general anti-immigrant or xenophobic sentiment? Welby is a close political ally of Grealish but did not associate himself with his comments. Rejecting the charge that the meeting had been racist, Welby says: “I reject the accusation. I have no problem with integrating. We have all nationalities in Oughterard, as it is. Our problem is this is a flawed process.”‘Positive experience’Grealish himself has gone to ground, staying silent. Galway anti-racism campaigner Joe Loughnane, who was at the meeting, has called for the TD’s resignation.However, Loughnane draws a distinction between him and the Oughterard locals, saying their opposition is not racist, but is, instead, derived from “fear and ignorance”. Despite local opposition, Kyne’s description of what has happened elsewhere has often been borne out by experience in places where the centres opened. Sometimes, though, they do not open.Centres in Ballaghaderreen, Co Roscommon Lisdoonvarna, Co Clare Rooskey in Co Roscommon, and Moville in Donegal were opposed. In the latter two places, the plans were dropped after vigilante action was taken.If opposition smacks of nimbyism (not-in-my-back-yard) then it has to be said that it is not just a rural phenomenon. In the late 1990s, Nutley Lane residents in Dublin 4 were quick to head to the courts when a centre was mooted for there.“It is almost a deja vu,” says Fine Gael councillor, Joe Garrihy. “There was little consultation. There were also concerns about our capacity to deal with the influx.”But over time, it all worked out well. “It has been a very positive experience in Lisdoonvarna,” he says. “The community have been very welcomed. We have more children attending our schools. There are extra children in our crèches. “They have joined our GAA clubs and soccer clubs. And now since they are allowed to work, virtually all adults have worked in our tourist industry, which is seasonal.”In Ballaghaderreen, the pattern was the same when Syrian refugees came. Initially, says Senator John O’Mahony, a native of the town, communications were very poor. “When there is a vacuum, there will be difficulties. These are very small communities and they need information.”That too went ahead. And how did it work out? “There was no fall out, absolutely not,” says O’Mahony. “People were welcoming. The leaders in the community led people to welcome in the refugees and it all worked out very well. It painted Ballaghaderreen in a good light.”Anti-immigrant viewsOn a wider level, do Grealish’s comments reflect a latent, but growing, anti-immigrant sentiment? Peter Casey’s high presidential election vote is partly explained by his negative comments about Travellers and immigrants. Dr Rory Costello of the Department of Politics in the University of Limerick surveyed 50,000 voters, finding that one-fifth have strong negative opinions about immigration and asylum-seekers.Such opinions are more often found in rural rather than in urban areas. Such people also tend to oppose European integration, Travellers, wind farms and carbon tax.Sinn Féin voters and (to a lesser extent) Fianna Fáil voters are the most likely to oppose, though the strongest level of opposition to asylum seekers comes from those who vote for independents.In the European elections they tended to be Casey voters, or the tiny number of voters supporting fringe candidates such as Ben Gilroy and Hermann Kelly.Putting this into perspective, however, Costello said Ireland has one of the lowest levels of opposition to immigrants and asylum seekers, along with Portugal, Sweden and Iceland, among 24 countries surveyed.So why has Ireland not yet seen a successful anti-immigrant party: “This is a bit of a chicken and egg situation,” says Costello. “Do these countries lack anti-immigrant parties because the public are generally not anti-immigration, or is opposition to immigration among the public relatively low because none of the main parties are stoking anti-immigrant views?”There is no settled answer to that. But as the Oughterard protest demonstrated this week, immigration is definitely not a non-issue in the State."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4018425.1568442227!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cameron truly sorry for division that followed brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer UK prime minister David Cameron speaks outside 10 Downing Street in central London before going to Buckingham Palace to tender his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II. Photograph: Oli ScarffAFPGetty Images.Former UK prime minister David Cameron has admitted that he failed in his bid to keep Britain in a reformed European Union and is “truly sorry” for the uncertainty and ision that followed the Brexit referendum.The Conservative (52) said he thinks about the consequences of the vote to leave the EU “every single day” and worries “desperately” about what will happen next.In an interview with the Times ahead of the publication of his memoir next week, Mr Cameron also said a second referendum cannot be ruled out - suggesting it could provide a way of “unblocking the blockage”.And he attacked Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for their part in the Leave campaign, accusing the pair of behaving “appallingly” and effectively “trashing” the Government.Mr Cameron also said they had “left the truth at home” regarding Turkey joining the EU and the claim that Britain sends £350 million a week to the bloc.In his long-awaited book, For The Record, which is serialised in The Times, the ex-PM wrote that “there are those who will never forgive me for holding it, or for failing to deliver the outcome - Britain staying in a reformed EU - that I sought.“I deeply regret the outcome and accept that my approach failed. The decisions I took contributed to that failure. I failed.”He admitted that he has “many regrets” and that there are “many things” he would do differently about the vote, but insisted renegotiating Britain’s relationship with the EU and giving the country a say was the “right approach”.‘I am truly sorry’“I did not fully anticipate the strength of feeling that would be unleashed both during the referendum and afterwards, and I am truly sorry to have seen the country I love so much suffer uncertainty and ision in the years since then,” Mr Cameron said.“But on the central question of whether it was right to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU and give people the chance to have their say on it, my view remains that this was the right approach to take.“I believe that, particularly with the Eurozone crisis, the organisation was changing before our very eyes, and our already precarious place in it was becoming harder to sustain.“Renegotiating our position was my attempt to address that, and putting the outcome to a public vote was not just fair and not just overdue, but necessary and, I believe, ultimately inevitable.”In an interview with the paper, he also took aim at Priti Patel’s “attack that wealthy people didn’t understand the problems of immigration”.“It felt very like she was put on point to do some attacking of the government and its record. I suppose some people would say all is fair in love and war and political campaigns.“I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other. And they did.”And he revealed that he once texted Mr Gove, now Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to say: “You are either a team player or a w**ker.”Mr Cameron also confessed that he got “off his head” on dope while at Eton, and said he smoked it later with his wife Samantha and her friends.On Boris JohnsonThe former PM - who said he had been “hugely depressed” about leaving Number 10 - described Mr Johnson as “easy to work with” but admitted that there had been “issues” between the pair.“I want him to succeed. I worked with him well, as I say in the book. I also say that he was a capable mayor. He was easy to work with. I thought he was very talented. I wanted him in my government,” he explained.“We’ve had issues. Even before Brexit, there were sometimes tensions and disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well. And I want him to succeed.“Look, he’s got a very clear strategy and plan. It’s, you know, not the approach that I would have taken, but I want him to succeed.”But on the new Prime Minister’s recent decision to prorogue Parliament for five weeks and withdraw the whip from 21 Tory MPs - including the likes of Ken Clarke and Sir Nicholas Soames - Mr Cameron expressed his disapproval.“Taking the whip from hard-working Conservative MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things. Neither do I think a no-deal Brexit is a good idea,” he said.On Friday Mr Johnson said he was not concerned about what his predecessor would write about him in the memoir.“I want people to be clear, absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs in the course of the next few days will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.“Not least for what he did in turning this country round after Labour left it bankrupt. I think he has a very distinguished record and a legacy to be proud of.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Labour\u0026#39s punitive tax raid on private schools will harm the state sector tooDavid Cameron attacks Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit as he breaks silenceComment: Ignore the no-deal Brexit doomsters.

We do a salsa and a waltz. The celebrities do, like, four steps and then we sort of move on.”A fellow dancer, Dianne Buswell, said she referred to the process as “speed dating”.As the celebrities dance with each professional in turn, producers walk around the room observing which pairings have the greatest chemistry.The celebrities and professionals at this year\u0026#39s Strictly launch showFootage of this year’s session will be included in a BBC One special, Strictly The Professionals, to be broadcast this Saturday.It features interviews with former contestants. Jake Wood, the EastEnders actor, said the event was unnerving: “The producers all walk around and you’re not sure what they’re looking at,” he said.Mollie King, the singer and 2017 semi-finalist, joked that “all of us female contestants danced with all of the pro boys and it was one of the best moments of my life, just being swung from man to man”.Brian Conley, the comedian, said the professional dancers were more interested in where the celebrities were based than their dancing ability.He recalled: “Everyone will come up to you and say, ‘Hello, where do you live?’ I thought, why does everyone want to know where I live? And it’s because they know they’ve got to rehearse with you and they don’t want to be too far away from London.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

When they first spotted it, they thought they had accidentally looked a star – but further research has shown that the black hole is in fact showing behaviour that astronomers had never expected.“We have never seen anything like this in the 24 years we have studied the supermassive black hole,” said Andrea\u0026nbspGhez, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and a co-senior author of the research. “It’s usually a pretty quiet, wimpy black hole on a diet.We don’t know what is driving this big feast.”Scientists looked through observations taken since 2003, from observatories in Hawaii and Chile. They noticed that on 13 May, the back hole was lit up twice as bright as had ever been before – and it continued to turn incredibly bright on two other nights this year.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThe changes are unprecedented, scientists say, and it is not clear why they are happening.Nasa reveals spectacular photo of avalanche on MarsThe kind of brightness spotted by researchers usually comes from radiation thrown out as gas and dust is eaten up by the black hole. As such, it could be just the beginning in a major change in the activity of the black hole.“The big question is whether the black hole is entering a new phase — for example if the spigot has been turned up and the rate of gas falling down the black hole ‘drain’ has increased for an extended period — or whether we have just seen the fireworks from a few unusual blobs of gas falling in,” said Mark Morris, UCLA professor of physics and astronomy and the author of a paper describing the discovery..Scientists will now keep looking at the area and hope that new images can help resolve that question. That could in turn help us understand how black holes grow and the kinds of effects they have on the galaxy and the larger universe.The brightening could have come from the fact that a star was seen going very close to the black hole in summer last year, or that another mysterious object known as G2 had its outer layer ripped off when it passed by in 2014. It might also be the result of big asteroids passing near the black hole, scientists said.The black hole poses no danger to life on Earth. It is 26,000 light years away, and the radiation coming out of it would need to be 10 billion times brighter to have any effect here.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

He noted that shorting, or betting against, sterling has become a very “crowded” – and hence less attractive – trade, prompting traders to bet the other way which also lifted the currency.Last week MPs passed a law preventing a no-deal Brexit on 31 October and refused to grant Boris Johnson an early general election, which he hoped would give him a majority in parliament.But the chances of leaving with an exit agreement are also uncertain as the only deal agreed with the EU after two years of talks has been rejected by Britain’s parliament three times.Since the vote to leave the EU, the pound has lost 17 per cent against the dollar and almost 15 per cent against the euro. \u0026nbspAdditional reporting by ReutersOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis.

We will not be doing a reboot.“There are two reasons for that, explained Kauffman.One of the reasons we won’t do a reunion is because this is a show about a time in your life when your friends are your family. And when you have a family, that changes. But the other reason is it’s not going to beat what we did.”Co-creator David Crane added: “We did the show we wanted to do. We got it right, and we put a bow on it. If you visited those characters now, it just would not be the same DNA and chances are, it wouldn’t be as good.”Created with Sketch.29 TV shows that have been made into bad films Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible. Ricky Gervais just couldn\u0027t stay away from his Office character David Brent and gave him the big screen treatment in 2016\u0027s Life on the Road. Every second paled in comparison to ever single episode of the classic BBC series.The experience of watching the first ever Pokémon film – titled Pokémon: The First Movie – can be likened to watching a YouTube tutorial of someone playing a Pokémon video game, only somehow more boring.The charming story of Postman Pat and his black and white cat in the fictional and busy village of Greendale first screened on the BBC in 1981. What a shame that Postman Pat: The Movie in 2014 – the 3D animated feature film version – managed to stray so far from its original simplicity. It sees Postman Pat (voiced by Stephen Mangan) enter an X-Factor style-singing contest, and despite featuring an impressive array of voice actors, including Rupert Grint, Jim Broadbent and David Tennant, the film was too scary for the under-fives – especially the scene that sees Pat turn into a sinister robot.2129 Sex and the CitySex and the City had all the ingredients for a great movie: starry cast, cult fanbase, glamorous setting. Alas, both films were an embarrassment to the original series. Not enough happened in the movies to warrant anything longer than a 30-minute episode and unfortunately we can never unsee Sarah Jessica Parker and co doing that bizarre slo-mo walk through the desert.The problem with 2015 film Spooks: The Greater Good is that is arrived about 10 years too late. Spooks was a decent BBC drama that ended in 2011 and that\u0027s how it should have stayed.Based on the 1975 series of the same name, this action crime thriller starred Samuel L Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, LL Cool J, Jeremy Renner, and Colin Farrell in one of his early box office hits. There was plenty of high-octane drama and Farrell was convincing as a hot-shot cop taking on a French drug lord (Olivier Martinez), but it’s also completely predictable and, ultimately, extremely pointless.An updated version of BBC crime series The Sweeney starring Ray Winstone sounds like something from spoof heaven. The finished film, released in 2012, didn\u0027t really do much to convince anyone that it wasn\u0027t. Sure, Ben Kingsley as The Hood is a great spot of casting, but practically everything else in the film version of Gerry Anderson\u0027s Thunderbirds failed to make the grade. Anderson himself was most damning he called it the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.There are some interesting things in Twilight Zone: The Movie, but it loses points for featuring one of the worst pieces of work from Steven Spielberg: a segment set in a retirement home titled Kick the Can.Just because the Veronica Mars cast and its loyal fans really wanted a movie spin-off to be made, it doesn’t mean it should have ever actually happened. The TV show was revived thanks to funds raised by star Kristen Bell on Kickstarter, but the film was criticised for making literally no sense for anyone who hadn’t watched the series.Famously bad, Wild Wild West was adapted from the 1960s TV show and was the 2000 recipient of the golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Joe Carnahan’s dusty and grimy adaptation retained the catchphrases and character personalities of the original series, while surrounding them with an entirely incoherent plot and noisy sub-Michael Bay action. Liam Neeson made for a fun Hannibal Smith and UFC fighter Quinton “Rampage” Jackson did his best as BA Baracus, but a never-more-slappable Bradley Cooper and the chronically unappealing Sharlto Copley were the pits.A sad-all-round adaptation of the cult MTV animated series from the 1990s, Aeon Flux abandoned the avant-garde, largely dialogue-free sensuality of its source material for generic action and dodgy special effects. If it weren’t for the classy presence of Charlize Theron and director Karyn Kusama, whose early cut was radically altered by producers, this would have basically been a bargain-bin Milla Jovovich joint. And that, honestly, would have been a lot more fun.Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman must have been grateful when Marvel came along and helped scrub 1998 film The Avengers even further out of cultural memory. But for those who had to endure their hammy 1998 adaptation of the classic spy series, it’d take a lot more than Iron Man and Captain America to make us forget the image of Sean Connery inexplicably dressed in a giant bear costume and trying to control the weather. Shudders.Although The Bad Education Movie arrived in a similar summertime slot to the successful Inbetweeners film, this sitcom adaptation was nowhere near as popular. Jack Whitehall’s performance was panned by critics who said he appeared “desperate to shock” as delinquent teacher Alfie Wickers and described the whole movie as a “farce”.This 1977 film based on BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? took its inspiration from a theatre production in Blackpool. While it found success on stage, the big screen version was met with hostility, with one critic calling it guilty of violating almost every law of comedy and film.David Hasselhoff is unforgettable as the hunky chief lifeguard Mitch Buchannon patrolling a sunny beach in Baywatch. After a rocky start when the first season was cancelled on NBC, it became the world\u0027s most-watched TV show, running in its original format for 10 years until 1999. The unnecessary big-screen version of the show starred Dwayne Johnson in Hasselhoff’s role and Zac Efron as a new recruit. Even the nostalgic cameo from the show\u0027s former star didn’t make up for the paper-thin plot.Because nose-centric glory for Nicole Kidman couldn’t happen twice, this adaptation of sparkly magical sitcom Bewitched arrived two years after the actor won her Oscar for The Hours, and promptly became a key component in her Queen of Flops reputation throughout the late-2000s. This had brilliance written all over it, from Nora Ephron behind the camera to Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman and Shirley MacLaine in the supporting cast, but still somehow managed to stink.Leigh Francis character Keith Lemon received the big screen treatment in 2012\u0027s Keith Lemon: The Film, one of the only titles to have ever received zero per cent on Rotten Tomatoes. Putting pins in one\u0027s eyes is rumoured to be a better experience.Despite an all-star cast that included Bill Nighy, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Gambon and Tony Jones, the poorly judged spin-off of the much-loved BBC sitcom Dad\u0027s Army (2016) took a pounding from critics, who derided the attempt at an homage to a TV show that had nothing wrong with it in the first place.The nadir of Tim Burton’s career, Dark Shadows was a film nobody was particularly crying out for, most of the fans of the original 1960s fantasy soap opera long dead and the general public having by then grown tired of Johnny Depp’s “heavily made-up comedy weirdo” schtick. Most egregious, however, was the film’s failure to properly utilise Michelle Pfeiffer 20 years after she played Catwoman in Burton’s Batman Returns.Julian Fellowes took the beloved TV drama about the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and the people who serve them – and turned it into one long fawning session about the royals. Absolutely nothing happens in this film where an entire sub-plot involves a boiler being fixed, and another, completely implausible storyline about an assassination attempt on the king. The only real intrigue is why Thomas, the butler, has suddenly acquired a very orange tan. This is what happens when British institutions get a Hollywood makeover, folks.1229 The Dukes of HazzardThere was a time when Johnny Knoxville, Seann William Scott and Jessica Simpson were the hottest cast in town. There was never a time this unwanted cinematic revival of the action comedy series wasn\u0027t entirely stupid. Life imitated art when the main stars at the heart of HBO show Entourage hit the red carpet for the film version. Sadly, it lacked the vim that was present in most seasons of the show and ultimately felt like a mediocre feature-length episode.Kevin and Perry Go Large was no doubt adored by teens everywhere upon its released in 2000, which is why it\u0027s gained a cult following in the years since. In all honesty, the film is so terrible it\u0027s actually brilliant.1529 The League of Gentlemen2005 film The League of Gentlemen\u0027s Apocalypse is proof that Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith, Mark Gatiss and Jeremy Dyson can do wrong. On the bright side, it\u0027s reassuring to know the multi-talented quartet are indeed human after all. It\u0027s not exactly clear who The Magic Roundabout film was intended for considering kids at the time would have had no idea who Dougal, Zebedee or company were. Save for providing work for Robbie Williams, Tom Baker and Bill Nighy, this version wasn’t much use for anyone. We are all to blame for the abysmal Mrs Brown\u0027s Boys D\u0027Movie. If the sitcom\u0027s Christmas specials weren\u0027t the most-watched episodes of television in the UK every year, then Brendan O\u0027Carroll probably wouldn’t have ever thought a film could be possible.

The new phone includes a chip referred to as U1, and which it says is used for sensing things in space.For now, it is only being used for a new feature that uses Apple\u0027s AirDrop technology, and allows people to point their phones towards another device and send files between the two. The chip can be used to precisely locate other devices, Apple said, meaning it can know exactly where it is pointing.But it is clear that the chip is really meant for a variety of other features, too. What is less clear is what exactly those features are.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

Somewhat ironically, it appears under a heading indicating that it will allow the phone to be more precise.Which new iPhone should you buy? 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max comparedThe new Apple-designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness – allowing iPhone 11 Pro to precisely locate other U1-equipped Apple devices, it reads. It\u0027s like adding another sense to iPhone, and it\u0027s going to lead to amazing new capabilities.Apple is already rumoured to be working on small tracking devices that could be added to objects to allow them to be found more easily. The phone could presumably seek out those devices – telling you not only how far away your keys are, for instance, but being able to work out which of your chairs they have fallen into, and where exactly they are.The chip could also presumably help with Apple\u0027s plans for augmented reality features. That requires detailed information about the nearby environment, which the chip could presumably help with.The chip is only found on the more expensive iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max, and not the cheaper iPhone 11.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In colour are active regions of the atmosphere of the Sun e.g. solar flares and coronal mass ejectionsThough the exoplanet was first spotted in 2015, new research has finally allowed scientists to reveal the existence of water.\u0026nbspCurrent equipment is only able to determine basic factors such as distance, mass and temperature but sophisticated tools developed at University College London helped\u0026nbsptranslate existing data from the Hubble Space Telescope to make sense of the unique molecule signatures of water vapour.K2-18b is classed as a super-Earth because it is bigger than our Earth – twice as big, as well as eight times heavier.K2-18b super-Earth (M\u0026nbspKornmesserESAHubbleAFP)K2-18b\u0026nbspis too far away for astronomers to see, but they can look at how starlight is filtered through the planet’s atmosphere as it passes around its own sun, called\u0026nbspK2-18.The planet is a lot closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, meaning it only takes around 33 days to transit.“It’s the only planet outside our solar system that we know has the correct temperature, an atmosphere and water,” said lead\u0026nbspauthor Dr\u0026nbspAngelos\u0026nbspTsiaras.“Of course,\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis not a second Earth, because it is a planet that is much bigger, has a different atmospheric composition. It’s orbiting a completely different star, so it doesn’t look like Earth.“The search for habitable planets, it’s very exciting, but it’s here to always remind us that this\u0026nbspis our only home and it’s probably out of the question if we will be able to travel to other planets.”Although the planet sits in the habitable zone, scientists say that instruments available at present are not able to determine any signs of life.Exoplanets will get real names rather than numbersMany more observations are needed\u0026nbspto be sure that it is\u0026nbsphabitable.Scientists, who have published their findings in the Nature Astronomy journal after more than a year of work, believe that the water content could be as low as 0.01 per cent\u0026nbspor as high as 50 per cent.“We don’t know how much water there is however, what these models clearly say is that there is an atmosphere and that there is water there,” said co-author Dr\u0026nbspIngo\u0026nbspWaldmann.Researchers do not think\u0026nbspK2-18b\u0026nbspis the only potentially habitable\u0026nbspsuper-Earth\u0026nbspand expect to find others with similar characteristics among more than 4,000 exoplanets that have already been discovered.They hope that newer technology, such as the James Webb Space Telescope due to launch in March 2021, will unlock more secrets beyond our solar system.“We are looking forward to the next generation of telescopes and going even further,” Dr\u0026nbspTsiaras\u0026nbspadded.Additional reporting by Press AssociationBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That would speed up progress on a Brexit deal acceptable both to the UK and the EU, as the so-called Irish backstop has been a major stumbling block.DUP leader Arlene Foster rejected the speculation, saying late on Thursday: UK must leave as one nation. We are keen to see a sensible deal but not one that ides the internal market of the UK.”Still, the pound gained more than 1 per cent against the dollar on Friday morning to trade as high as $1.2475, a seven-week high.

The actual figure could be higher when Labour releases official totals next week.\u0026nbspMost of the motions submitted are based on a template saying Labour should “campaign energetically for a public vote and to Remain” and “support revoking Article 50 if necessary to prevent no deal”. They say the party should also “defend free movement and extend migrants’ rights”.It raises the prospect of a fresh battle between activists and the party leadership when the motion\u0026nbspis debated by delegates at the gathering. The text is likely to be amended during lengthy discussions to hammer out a compromise, with Mr Corbyn’s team and some trade unions expected to try to tone down some of the more anti-Brexit language.Michael Chessum, national organiser for Another Europe is Possible, said: “In an election, Labour needs the space to articulate a radical set of policies that will transform the economy and people’s lives. In government, it needs to be able to deliver on its promises. To have either of these things, we need to defeat Brexit and move the conversation on.“The public wants this to be over – any sense that we are going to engage in a lengthy renegotiation will be deeply unpopular. In government, Brexit would be an albatross around our necks – a pointless loss of time and energy, probably a loss of rights and protections and a fracturing of our support base.”Labour MP Clive Lewis, a supporter of the campaign, said: “As an MP, I know what wins elections for Labour – it’s our members, who are more than 90 per cent in favour of Remain.“Our army of volunteers aren’t just foot soldiers, they’re members of a democratic movement. They need to feel ownership over our Brexit policy, they need to be excited and enthused by it. Yes, the people should have the final say, but for our morale we need a clear anti-Brexit position in Labour. That means we must campaign in any public vote for Remain.”\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The UK would also be on track for a four-day working week by 2040.“Hour by hour, day by day, we are giving an unnecessarily large proportion of our lives over to work,” said Aidan Harper, researcher at the NEF, noting that the average British worker spends 4,512 hours on unpaid overtime over their career.\u0026nbspThat amounts to over half a year of unpaid work.A study by the TUC earlier this year also found that the typical full-time employee in the UK puts in 42 hours a week – nearly two hours more than the average across the EU and equivalent to an extra two and a half weeks a year.Mr Harper added: “In a fair and just society free time would be viewed as an essential resource which we have a claim upon… It would mean building an economy that ensures that the gains of economic activity are shared evenly with workers not only in the form of pay but also in the form of working time reduction.”One explanation for the stagnation in working hours since 1980 may be a fall in trade union membership, as well as less strict labour market regulation, the NEF said. The think tank will publish a fuller report on this trend later in the autumn.Last month, the NEF said an increase in leisure time will help accelerate growth in Britain’s productivity, which has slowed down sharply since the financial crisis. Giving people more paid time off work will enable them to spend more, boosting demand in the economy and encouraging firms to invest, according to research by the think tank.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Within the country’s overlooked hinterland, conditions are desperate, with unemployment in some areas thought to be as high as 30 per cent.Despite a much vaunted war on corruption, spearheaded by presidential candidate and current prime minister Youssef Chahed, the perception across much of the country is one of an entrenched elite getting richer, while many are left to languish in poverty.Created with Sketch.

The result was television on a scale rarely seen in Tunisia’s modern history, with 11 of the country’s television channels carrying the debate, alongside 20 radio stations.From an initial field of almost 100, including the Middle East’s first openly gay candidate, the field has been whittled down to 26, all of whom now vie for the position of head of state.\u0026nbspAppearing alongside relative outsiders, such as idiosyncratic law professor\u0026nbspKais Saied and Abir Moussi, an avowed apologist for Tunisia’s pre-revolutionary regime, were establishment stalwarts, Chahed, defence minister Abdelkarim Zbidi and the first presidential candidate to be fielded by moderate Islamists Ennahda, Abdelfattah Mourou.In cafes around the capital, crowds spilled out onto the street as Tunisians gathered to watch their potential leaders trade in soundbites for the chance to proceed to the second round of voting, the date for which has yet to be announced. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNevertheless, despite Karoui’s absence, rumours of private polls conducted by various international agencies suggest the momentum of his insurgent campaign may not have been dented by his absence. Across the country, the same anger that sparked the country’s 2011 revolution continues to fester and continues to fuel Nabil Karoui’s populist campaign.Karoui\u0026nbsphas remained in detention since his arrest on 23 August, and he lost the second of two appeals for conditional release on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the febrile atmosphere of the presidential campaign, much of the substance of the charges against\u0026nbspKaroui\u0026nbspand his brother, which were initially brought by anti-corruption watchdog,\u0026nbspIWatch, in 2016, are often overlookedYoussef Chahed (AP)In the build-up to the campaigning period, his television station\u0026nbspNessma TV made great play of images of Karoui distributing aid via his charitable association, Khalil Tounes, to the overlooked interior regions while railing against the shortcomings of Chahed and his government.“Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditions,” Tunisian political analyst Youssef Cherif tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.\u0026nbsp“They promise to change things and they point to the factclaim that they have nothing to do with the current conditions, that they’ll do better. So people, in search of hope, believe them and fall for their rhetoric.”Always perceived as something of a maverick, Riahi has yet to greatly trouble Tunisia’s political conscience.He fled the country in November after he accused of Chahed and his immediate circle of plotting a coup d’etat. The charges were swiftly dismissed by the military court Riahi had lodged them with.Populists and outsiders benefit from the general discontent about the bad economic conditionsHowever, the accusation reinforced the perception among parts of Tunisia’s political class who sought to portray the prime minister as a tyrant, a perception Karoui’s team made much play of during his campaign, significantly ratcheting up their denunciations of official complicity in the businessman’s arrest on 23 August. \u0026nbspInstead, Karoui’s supporters cast them, and the delay in bringing them to court, as further evidence of an orchestrated campaign to silence their “Nelson Mandela of Tunisia”.Meet the man hoping to become the Muslim world’s first gay presidentTheir claims are not entirely without substance.In May, the outspoken television mogul had his channel taken off air after armed police raided his offices in central Tunis alleging breaches of broadcasting guidelines.In July, shortly after Karoui established his lead in the last of the official polls, the government passed an electoral amendment that would have essentially precluded him and a small number of rival candidates from running for president, legislation that former President Essebsi declined to either sign into law or return to parliament before his death.Irrespective of the claims of either camp, after years of marginalisation many within Tunisia are choosing to see the coming contest as one between the establishment class that has consistently overlooked them, and a fresh tranche of anti-system politicians that, like so many around the world, promise\u0026nbspto rewrite the rulebook in their favour. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

But he fell out of favour with Mr Erdogan in recent years, and has been sharply critical of his rule in recent months, prompting the party’s disciplinary board to consider his expulsion.In a televised appearance, the 60-year-old scholar and diplomat said he was quitting the AKP rather than forcing the trauma of a schismatic confrontation. \u0026nbspFor several years, Mr Davutoglu’s criticisms had been muted and mostly tolerated by Mr Erdogan. But an allegation he made last month suggesting government complicity in a series of 2015 terrorist attacks apparently crossed the line. The violent attacks scuttled peace talks between the Turkish state and rebellious Kurds, and appeared to bolster Mr Erdogan’s popularity ahead of general elections.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Rescue workers on a boat rescue a person stranded inside a flooded tunnel after heavy floods in Pilar de la Horadada, SpainPolice officers try to control the crowd after members of the public were invited to view Robert Mugabe\u0027s body as it lies in state at the Rufaro stadium in Harare, ZimbabweA US flag hangs from a steel girder, damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center at a memorial in Jersey City.

A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

Another founder of the AKP, former president Abdullah Gul, has been rumoured to be behind the effort but has yet to formally announce any involvement.\u0026nbspMr Davutoglu was widely seen as more moderate than Mr Erdogan, and has voiced sympathy for opposition activists and journalists caught up in the government’s years-long dragnet. But he was also the architect of the country’s Syria policy, and is blamed by both Erdogan supporters and opponents for opening Turkey’s borders to allow millions of Syrian refugees to settle in the country.\u0026nbspDavutoglu\u0026nbspannounced his resignation in a televised appearance (Haber Turk)Analysts say Mr Babacan’s prospects are better. Many Turks see him as the man behind the country’s decade-long economic boom, and see his departure from the cabinet in 2015 as the beginning of Turkey’s fiscal troubles. In an interview with the daily paper Karar this week, Mr Babacan insisted his new party would stand up for human rights, civil liberties, democracy and the rule of law.\u0026nbsp“This is what Turkey strongly needs right now,” he was quoted as saying. “Freedom of thought and freedom of faith. The state itself should be the guarantor of this.”Unless there is pressure for early elections, Mr Erdogan will remain firmly in charge as president until 2023. He\u0026nbsphas dismissed the defections, predicting Mr Babacan “will go nowhere” by forming a new party, and accusing him of iding the Muslim community.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Secular, nationalist, and leftist opposition parties broke open Turkey’s constricted political space this year with victories against Mr Erdogan’s allies in mayoral elections, and some have accused the AKP dissidents of opportunistically entering the fray while doing little to resist the party’s abuses when they were in government.\u0026nbspRecep Tayyip Erdogan shows snippets from New Zealand terrorist videos at campaign rallies“We didn’t really know about any of the disputes they had until they left,” said Onur Yerim, president of Dragoman Strategies, an Istanbul risk consultancy. “Nothing has surfaced over the years that there were major disagreements over policy. If there was, why didn’t they do anything about it when they were part of parliament or the cabinet and had seats and roles?”But analysts say the defections\u0026nbspcould nonetheless hurt Mr Erdogan, and help the opposition, potentially ending the political dominance of the AKP which began in 2002.\u0026nbsp“We are not sure whether it will lead to a big split among party members, but Davutoglu is claiming that the AK Party has lost its soul, its founding principles,” said Ilhan Uzgel, a political scientist based in Ankara. “He may not garner a lot of votes, but it may harm the image of the party, which is going in the direction of authoritarianism and corruption.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Theresa May gave lordships and knighthoods to her Brexit-blocking favourites.And Commons Speaker John Bercow allowed Remainers to coat him with unctuous praise after he said he was off to spend more time with his £million pension pot.After the vain and aggressive Bercow announced he will finally quit at the end of October, he allowed MPs to spend the next hour and a half nishing him with a weird mix of treacle and bulls**t.“Ah, Mr Snodgrass, you want to say what a marvellous chap I am  The floor is yours.”And yes, they really did go on for an appalling, toe-curling hour and a half — even while they were moaning about being short of time to discuss Brexit.Long after closing time in most pubs, a group of anti-Brexit MPs engineered a physical tussle around the Speaker’s Chair.They hoped their stunt would symbolise their disapproval of Boris Johnson closing down this madhouse parliament for a few weeks in his “prorogation” gambit, which has been approved by the courts.What a pathetic spectacle ensued. One prize prat, Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle, tried to jump into Bercow’s lap, pleading with him not to leave the Chamber.It was like seeing a poodle try to jump on to its mistress’s knees.Russell-Moyle was then yanked out of the way by Bercow’s tailcoated minders, and some baby boxing wrists were flapped — handbags at midnight. Classy, eh Some of the House’s most verbose MPs held up sheets of paper saying, “Silenced”.They bleated, “Shame!” and booed when the twirly ceremonial closure of the House began. Bercow added to the hysteria by screaming abuse at Tory MPs.The country must have looked at these maniacs and thought: “Oh do act your age.” What will the outside world have made of it all You occasionally see TV news footage of punch-ups in foreign parliaments, places like Taiwan and Turkey and Uganda.This time the farcical argy-bargy was happening in our own House of Commons. Vladimir Putin must be laughing so hard his plastic surgery may soon rip.Our allies in places such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand must be slapping their foreheads and thinking: “What on earth has happened to the once-calm, reasonable United Kingdom.Can we really do business with this deranged political elite that is ignoring a national referendum ” Theresa May’s resignation honours list was little better.It has long been the custom — heaven knows why — for departing Prime Ministers to nominate a few friends for honours. That practice must now, surely, please be reviewed.Apart from the knighthoods for cricketers Andrew Strauss and Geoffrey Boycott , Mrs May rewarded a bunch of no-hopers in her political circle.Peerages went to her useless chief of staff Gavin Barwell and to her Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins, the civil servant with whom May bypassed elected Cabinet ministers before the Chequers summit of .Various spin doctors were on May’s list, too. Ditto former deputy PMDavid Lidington and big-bucks Tory donors Ehud Sheleg and David Brownlow.One of the few creditable things about Mrs May used to be that she resisted dishing out honours to her mates. Now she has blown even that part of her reputation.If Mrs May had managed to get us out of the EU, as instructed by the electorate, that might have just about passed the smell test.But these drongos were a catastrophic flop. The May team pursued a “Brexit in name only” and could not even achieve that.Honouring them is like giving an open-topped bus ride through the streets to a football team that has just been relegated. What will voters make of this gongs-for-the-boys culture A harmless bit of fun  Or a remote parliamentary crowd giving twirly titles to a long line of sub-par operatives The worst thing is that few of us are surprised by this stuff. I don’t suppose many of us genuinely believe politicians’ promises any more.How can we, when they said they would “honour the referendum” but now tell Boris Johnson to go to Brussels with a surrender letter This same elite, which so casually bungs honours to its pals, always sneers at the word “populist” as being something almost dirty.Instead, it wants the status quo. But the status quo, as we can see, is this gang of grotesques who are histrionically opposed to Brexit and who are so greedily self-rewarding.Why on earth is Jeremy Corbyn so keen on them  The country is desperate for change from these crooks and limpets. We want to get rid of them. Yet Corbyn’s Labour wants to keep them in power. He has become the establishment’s stooge.If populism is the alternative to Bercow and Co, that sounds pretty good to me. Boris Johnson has already shown himself ready to upset the elite. Let’s have more of that.If it takes some sort of electoral pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, who cares  The elite has chosen to float away from us.

Then we saw the Labour and Green MPs’ tantrum in the Commons.Grown men and women, elected to office, protesting like teenagers with scrawled banners bleating “silenced”.Silenced  How For three years they have been given every  to proclaim their loathing of Brexit and campaign to reverse it.They are forcing the PM to beg a delay from the EU, threatening him with jailhe refuses and compelling him to release aides’ private messages.These muppets are not oppressed insurgents. They are the Remainer establishment, reasserting the status quo for the London Europhile elite.And silencing .million voices for Leave.MIND-boggling as it is, the party with “Democrats” in its title is now fully committed to annulling the biggest democratic mandate in our history.But at least the Liberals are upfront: That they value democracy onlyit delivers what they want. If not, ignore it.Labour, by contrast, is still weaselling away — too cowardly for an election, too terried to tell four million of its supporters it will negate their Brexit vote.Having seen its Brexit policy become a national joke last week, it now says it would hold a second referendum with a “credible” Leave option vs Remain. And it won’t officially say which it would back.They’re fooling absolutely no one.And what “Leave option” would this be, anyway  Some fantasy Labour deal, even softer than Theresa May’s That would be blatantly unfair to Leavers, since many want No Deal.But then Remainers are no longer even pretending their second vote will be fair.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The whining. The complaining from both sidesabout a lack of democracy.The snarled fury. The endless bloody ponticating.It’s been more than three years and still nobody knows what the hell Labour’s policy is.Get a deal from Brussels and then vote against it, so far as I can discern.God only knows what sort of drugs old man Steptoe and his magic band of brothers are on.But then I’m not too sure what BoJo is up to either, and this is a problem.My guess is thatour Prime Minister wrestles some kind of deal from Brussels, the vast majority of the country will heave an enormous sigh of relief.We can all get on with our lives. Boris can busy himself with building very large bridges across the Irish Sea. Whatever deal he gets, it won’t be a proper Brexit.I have always said, right from day one, that our liberal establishment would never let us leave.And the sort of deal Boris is inching towards now will not be what we might call a full Brexit.It will involve, at the least, selling out the Northern Irish. Over the blessed “backstop”. And here’s the problem for Johnson.If he does that there will still be a large contingent of people very unhappy indeed — and not just the DUP.It means he won’t be able to strike a meaningful deal with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.And that, in turn, means the ­Conservative Party will go into the next election, which is coming very soon, with only a slender hope of victory.The Brexit Party is likely to take enough votes from the Tories to ensure they do not win.That would mean — at best — a hung parliament. And you can bet some sort of coalition deal will be struck between Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP.This would result in a rejection of any deal. And almost certainly a second ­referendum on whether we should leave or not.Except that the choices on the ballot paper next time will be gerrymandered to ensure Remain wins .But what  is Boris to do We can’t leave with No Deal — the best option of those available right now — because ­Parliament won’t let him. His hands are tied.He started well in the job, did old BoJo.

Bigger than  football pitches, it has room for , staff.It’s now clear that, far from harming the Square Mile, Brexit will help London cement its place as the world’s leading financial hub.Now the Project Fear merchants issue blood-curdling warnings against a No Deal Brexit, making it impossible for Boris Johnson to negotiate with Brussels.Ex-Chancellor Philip Hammond says leaving against the EU’s wishes would cost Britain £billion — equivalent to a whopping four per cent of our annual GDP — doing damage “equivalent to the  financial crash”.Spreadsheet Phil’s meltdown scenario, based on those same  Treasury forecasts, lacks all credibility.EU trade accounts for barely a tenth of the UK economy. Just eight per cent of our firms do business with the -member bloc.The idea Brexit would cause a shock equal to the largest peace-time slowdown in a century, when the entire world economy slumped, is absurd.No Deal is constantly demonised by those who “respect the Referendum result” but are really Brexit-blockers. Preparations have been made on all sides to minimise any disruption.Agreements have been struck so exports will keep flowing and planes will fly.Phone roaming charges won’t change, as the big ­telecom outfits have now ­confirmed.Trade agreements with our most important global customers have been agreed or are in the works.What the doom-mongers don’t mention is that No Deal could mean lower prices for food and consumer goods such as clothing and footwearthe UK drops high tarfs on imports from outside the EU which, for now, Brussels forces us to impose.It is rarely acknowledged that the Irish government has admitted there won’t be new physical infrastructure in ­sensitive locations, and customs checks can happen away from the Irish border.When did you last hear on the TV news that UK exports to the EU have fallen from  per cent of goods we sold abroad  years ago to just  per cent now — despite the much-vaunted single market and customs union it would apparently be so disastrous to leave And why are we never told UK trade outside the EU is now not only the majority of our trade, but is fast-growing, produces a surplus and is conducted largely under World Trade Organisation rules Of course the future is not without danger.

What forward-thinking firm would want to invest in a country where the government would take ten per cent of your companyyou happen to be successful enough to employ more than  people That’s what Corbyn and his Marxist dreamers are planning.And the wind in their sails blows hard, thanks not to their appeal on the doorstep — two thirds of Brits think him indecisive and incompetent, according to a recent YouGov poll.No, Comrade Corbyn has been helped by the Remainer corporate establishment, in turn assisted by gloomy Remainer economists and an overwhelmingly Remainer media class, which has railed against a genuine Brexit.It’s now threatening to overturn the  Referendum result altogether. That would mean thwarting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, evenhe can only offer No Deal, which could easily result in Corbyn entering No.But any No Deal damage would be minimal and ­temporary.

For a packet of  cigarettes the saving will be as much as £. But Hancock, it appears, will not be celebrating.He has complained that he wasn’t consulted about the Chancellor’s plan to reintroduce duty free on trips from EU countries, and that it will help to undermine the Department of Health’s campaigns to persuade us to smoke and drink less.Obviously, that is good advice. But is anyone really going to take up smoking or go on a drinking binge just because it becomes a little cheaper to buy cigarettes and alcohol at an airport Duty free is a harmless little treat for ing holiday- makers — something to ensure we remain in good cheer for a few weeks after wefrom holiday, or a little in the way of compensationit rained all week on our Spanish beach.Duty free, as anyone over  will remember, used to be a staple part of a foreign holiday. The concept arose because once we have passed through security at a port or airport, we are deemed for tax purposes already to have left the country.Customs and Excise authorities concluded, there- fore, that they had no right to charge us duties designed to capture taxes from domestic consumption.We are theoretically still liable to pay duty on goods when we are entering a country. But in practice most countries will waive duty on small quantities of alcoholic drinks and tobacco products brought in by arriving passengers.As a result, passengers arriving in Britain from non-EU countries are currently allowed to bring back up to four litres of still wine, a litre of spirits,  litres of beer and  cigarettes without paying duty.For passengers arriving in Britain from other EU countries, however, the rules changed in  — seven years after the creation of the single market.Duty free was abolished for people travelling between EU countries. In some ways, the single market was more generous than the previous duty-free regime.Rather than just four litres of wine, for example, we are now allowed to bring unlimited quantities of wine without paying UK duty, so long as it is only for personal consumption.Given that the duty on wine is a lot lower in France than in Britain, we can save a small fortune by stocking up in a French hypermarket.What the EU single market did stop, however, was our ability to travel, say, from France to Britain without paying duty in either country. What Sajid Javid wants to do is to give us the best of both worlds.From October  — assuming we leave the EU without continuing to be subject to the rules of the single market — we will regain our duty-free allowances.But, in addition, we will continue to be allowed to bring unlimited quantities of alcohol and tobacco which we bought in France and which we intend to use only for personal consumption.The main beneficiaries of duty free, needless to say, are smokers and drinkers. But you don’t have to smoke or drink in order to benefit from its existence.The profits from duty free allow airlines and ferry operators to keep their ticket prices down. When the EU proposed to abolish duty free in the s, the travel industry calculated that , jobs in the UK were dependent on its existence.That was no doubt exaggerated for effect, and of course the budget airline industry has grown hugely in the past  years.Butwe want to be able to continue to fly to Spain for a tenner , the reintroduction of duty free is going to be a signicant influence on what airlines can offer by way of cheap tickets.The fuss over Sajid Javid’s proposal has reopened isions in the Government over so-called “sin taxes” on booze and fags.For some, like Matt Hancock, who this week praised the sugar levy on fizzy drinks, sin taxes are a useful instrument for persuading us to lead healthier lives. Others, the Prime Minister included, are more guarded.The problem with slapping taxes on alcohol, cigarettes and unhealthy food is that they are regressive taxes which impact disproportionately on the poor.I would say to Matt Hancock: Give us all the advice on healthy living that you can. And I don’t object to proportionate taxes which reflect the cost of medical care for smokers and excessive drinkers.But leave it to us to decide how we want to lead our lives — and don’t deny us a small pleasure like being able to buy a small duty-free treat on our way home.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is because they are so far apart that architects had to factor in the curvature of Earth.Today, it’s still as unnecessary as it ever was. And it’s no longer the longest suspension bridge in the world. But it remains, in my opinion, the most beautul.In fact, and I’ve said this often, it’s the most beautul man-made thing of all time. Apart from maybe the Riva Aquarama speedboat.When I stand on the south shore on a misty morning and see the wafer-thin road disappearing off into the sea, it takes my breath away. It really does.So I’m glad it was made. And I’m glad too that the Labour government also built the Post Office Tower, even though it is now just a hazard to aircraft.Then there’s Concorde. The world did not need such a thing.And the technical challenges facing the engineers were huge. A Nasa boffin once told me that getting a passenger plane up beyond Mach  was more dficult than putting a man on the moon.But that old commie Tony Benn had decided Concorde was going to succeed, so he pushed and he pushed and, by God, are we glad he did.Can you imagine such a thing Because even though the beautul white bird is now grounded, we still have those memories of the shattering noise it made and the way it could make the sun rise in the West.I remember once, standing on a beach in Barbados as a British Airways Concorde roared overhead at treetop height.After it had passed, a stunned American on the next sun lounger looked at me and said: “You Brits.”I was so proud, I didn’t get round to telling him it was half French.Since Concorde though, Britain hasn’t really done anything of any great importance. There’s been talk of a new railway line from London to Manchester, but in evolutionary terms that’s just a shuffle. And now it probably won’t happen anyway.Which is why I am SO excited about the idea of a bridge linking Larne, in Northern Ireland with Portpatrick, in Scotland.Weirdly, the Labour Party — the party that created the Post Office Tower and Concorde and the Humber Bridge — are furious, saying it’s not needed and will be too expensive and it’s only been suggested to get Boris out of his backstop hole.But can you imagine such a thing A -mile bridge supported on columns ,ft high, and rising even higher in the middle so ships can pass underneath. It would be magnicent.Yes, it would be dficult to make.

It was “furious rabies” which causes extreme thirst and a morbid fear of water. At the same time.Mercully, he has now died. And we, meanwhile, are left to ponder what sort of a God comes up with a disease like that to end nearly , lives every year.ON the basis you should know your enemy, I read a book on holiday this year about why we shouldn’t kill animals.It wasn’t called – “If you eat meat, you’re a bastard”, but that was the thrust.And after a while, I deliberately left it in the rain, so I didn’t have to finish it.However, since I ed to Britain about a month ago, I still haven’t been able to eat pork.Cows  Chickens  Sheep  Not really bothered.But some of the things I read in that book about how pigs can play video games and feel love – they stuck.And so did the bit about how frightened they look when they are being taken to the slaughterhouse.I tried this morning to have a bacon sandwich but I couldn’t bring myself to put it in my mouth.It’s annoying. Pork was always my favourite meat but I’ll have to find a substitute.I’m thinking badger. Or maybe a nice roast fox.I know people who’ve found lost phones in their trouser pockets, and most women are of capable losing anything up to a medium-sized dog in their handbags.But I’ve never heard of anyone losing themselves. Until now.A party of tourists on a bus tour of Iceland spent hours searching for a missing passenger only to find she was in the search party.She hadn’t recognised the description of herself and it wasn’t until three in the morning that her mistake became clear.Bet she was popular.AT long last, space boffins have found a planet which they reckon could be capable of supporting le.They will know soonit has an atmosphere but they’ve already worked out that the romantically named K-b does have water. And it’s only million million miles away, which means that with current technology, we could reach it in just two million years.The only problem I can see is that it’s twice the size of Earth, with eight times the mass, so any astronaut who had survived the -light year journey would weigh quite a lot when he arrivedSo much, in fact, that after a little while, his brain would be dragged into his spinal cord.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Second, it must protect the integrity of the EU’s single market. Third, it must not involve any checks on the island of Ireland.Barclay said the UK could meet the first two of these tests, but not the third. He said there was no point in presenting any detailed proposals until the EU shted on the question of checks.One Government source explains thatthe UK did, the “EU would nuke the proposals and we would be in chaos”.So the challenge for Boris is to get the EU to move on this third point. His Monday meeting with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker gives him a chance to lobby him on this very issue.Juncker is an instinctive deal-maker and, with his term as president due to end on October , he will be keen to resolve Brexit before he goes.I also understand that several EU governments, including in France, are now apprehensive about the possibility of a second referendum.They believe it would be bad for the EU for the UK to stay in given how contested UK membership now is.They fear this would lead to every Council decision, all new EU legislation and every European Court of Justice judgment becoming a matter of controversy.The EU, though, will not abandon Ireland. This means that whatever proposal Boris comes up with will have to be something Leo Varadkar is prepared to swallow.The first meeting between the two men has given Downing Street some hope that they can find something that works for Dublin, them and the DUP.The DUP’s willingness to entertain Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on agriculture has opened the door to further discussions.If Parliament had not tied Boris’s hands, he could have seenthe risk of No Deal would have pushed Dublin and the EU to compromise on the checks front. But his ability to negotiate is now weakened.For this and other reasons, the odds are still against a deal. But there is a greater chance of one than a week ago.The Liberal Democrats start their conference today in their strongest position for years.They are polling around  per cent and in line to make major gains at the next election.At conference next week they are expected to adopt as their position that a Lib Dem government – stop laughing at the back – would simply revoke Article , cancelling the referendum result.This will establish them as the most unambiguously anti-Brexit party, a development that concerns a growing number of Labour MPs in Remain seats who want their party to take a clearer line on the issue for fear of losing ground to the Lib Dems.At the same time, the policy means that the Liberal Democrats can tell voters they will make the whole issue go away. By contrast, a second referendum would drag things out.If politics is now about Leave v Remain, rather than Left v Right, expect the Lib Dems to come back with more MPs than they have ever had before, following the next election.One of the things that urgently needs sorting out in this country is technical education.Those who don’t want to do an academic degree are being ill-served by further education.Gavin Williamson, the new Education Secretary, told Cabinet this week that there are up to , people trained in Hair  Beauty yet only a need for about , new recruits to work in this industry each year.The result is tens of thousands of people doing courses that don’t lead to them getting jobs or boost this country’s productivity.Those who want a second Brexit referendum are now arguing there shouldn’t be a General Election until a second referendum has taken place.Tony Blair, Labour’s deputy leader Tom Watson and Tory rebel Oliver Letwin have all made that case this week.Leave aside the massive issue of whether there should be a second referendum before the result of the first one has even been implemented, this plan would mean that this Parliament would have to carry on sitting until well into .This is a disastrous idea. This is a useless Parliament and keeping it going will just add to the national paralysis.With no party able to command a majority in the Commons, nothing can get done. Eventhis Parliament could muster a majority for a referendum, which is far from certain, it could do so for little .It is hard to see what meaningful domestic legislation can come out of this Parliament given that neither Boris Johnson nor Jeremy Corbyn can secure the backing of most MPs.The public desire for politicians to get on with both Brexit and the domestic agenda is why No will spend next week trying to emphasise its tough-on-crime policies.I understand Boris Johnson will put flesh on the bones of his plan to end early release for violent and unrepentant criminals.Friends are urging Amber Rudd to stand in the West London seat of Kensington at the next election.Its controversial Labour MP, Emma Dent Coad, has a majority of just .The thinking goes that the constituency isn’t keen on either No Deal or Jeremy Corbyn, so Rudd could do well standing as an independent.But it is exceptionally hard for independents to win seats, andRudd were to go down this course, she would be standing in the constituency for the first time – she is currently MP for Hastings, down on the south coast. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Shane Moore condemned allegations that his mum Margaret, , was not the victim of domestic abuse as “a joke” and “all wrong”. Shane, who works in Monaco on the French Riviera, also revealed she is too ill to talk. Domestic violence charities have been appalled by the decision to give cricket legend Boycott, , a knighthood.It was awarded to the former England captain in Theresa May ’s resignation honours list.   A French judge who convicted Boycott said she stands by the guilty verdict. The Yorkshireman was convicted in  of assaulting Ms Moore in a hotel in France two years previously. She was left with black eyes. A court was told he hit her  times. The retired judge, Dominique Haumant, who said Boycott’s conduct in court was “arrogant” and “deplorable”, added: “I cannot believe he’s being received by the Queen. “I’m told she will take a sword and anoint him on each shoulder. He doesn’t deserve it.” Boycott has always denied he assaulted Ms Moore.    Reacting to the fury at the knighthood, he said he “couldn’t give a toss”. He was first convicted in his absence. Boycott successfully appealed to have the verdict set aside and he was in court for a second trial. It was presided over by Ms Haumant who has reportedly said: “His version was Madame Moore had fallen on the carpet... I remarked ‘she didn’t get two black eyes falling on the thick carpet of a luxury hotel’. “He claimed it was an accident, but... I thought he was guilty and I stand by that.

The former PM’s drug use is revealed in a bombshell interview to plug his new book.He accuses Boris Johnson of switching to back Leave for personal ambition and brands ex-pal Michael Gove “mendacious”.After skulking away over his ­referendum defeat, Mr Cameron has emerged from the chaos he helped create to stick the kne into Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.The former PM accused the current leader of only supporting Leave for personal ambition, as he bids to be a Brexit martyr by trying to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal.   And self-pitying Mr Cameron branded his ex-friend Michael Gove “mendacious” for betraying him after the referendum humiliation in , which ended his days as PM. The former public schoolboy also admitted getting “off his head” on dope at Eton and smoking it again later with we Samantha and her friends. His confession came in a bombshell interview with The Times to plug his ­autobiography, For The Record, which is published next Thursday Mr Cameron also told how the Leave campaign’s Brexit victory left him depressed – but there was no apology for the mayhem his decision to hold a ­isive referendum has since caused.    In the book he accuses Mr Johnson and Mr Gove of behaving “appallingly” as the Brexit campaign became “this terrible Tory psychodrama”. He whined: “I thought there were places Conservatives wouldn’t go against each other. Quagmire “I say in the book, Boris had never argued for leaving the EU, right  “Michael was a strong ­Eurosceptic, but someone whom I’d known as this liberal, compassionate, rational Conservative ended up making arguments about Turkey [joining the EU] and being swamped and what have you. “They were trashing the Government of which they were a part, effectively. “I felt like I was in a sort of quagmire by the end.”    Mr Cameron claims as the  battle geared up, Mr Johnson believed Leave would be defeated. He said: “Boris thought he was going to lose. “When he made the decision to back Leave he said, ‘Brexit will be crushed.’ ” Talking of Mr Johnson’s ambition, he added: “I think he was genuinely torn, but I came to the conclusion in the end that it was too tempting not to run that campaign and go that way.” As revealed in yesterday’s Mirror, Mr Gove bears the brunt of Mr Cameron’s unprecedented attack. He even branded the former ­Education Secretary a “w****r” over his reluctance to change jobs in a reshuffle. Mr Cameron had decided to demote Gove to Chief Whip after years of rocky relations with teachers. But when he refused to budge, Cameron said, he text him: “You are either a team player or a w****r.” In the interview, Mr Cameron complained he was “miserable about giving up the job I loved and working for the country I loved”. He said he was “hugely depressed about it”. But he still refused to accept ­responsibility for unleashing the chaos and paving the way for the current crisis in which the country is mired.  Mr Cameron, who insisted he is not in favour of no-deal, said: “Every single day I think about it, the ­referendum and the fact that we lost and the consequences and the things that could have been done dferently, and I worry desperately about what is going to happen next. “I think we can get to a situation where we leave but we are friends, neighbours and partners. We can get there, but I would love to fast-forward to that moment because it’s painful for the country and it’s painful to watch.” Pointing to “all those people who wanted a referendum”, he accepted many would never forgive him for ordering an In-Out vote. But he admitted to being accosted in the street by angry electors furious at what has unfolded.  Mr Cameron said: “You get lots of dferent reactions. “What I tried to do in the book was explain why I felt this was inevitable.” The multi-millionaire claimed he worries “desperately about what is going to happen next”. He also accepted a second Brexit referendum could be on the cards. Mr Cameron added: “I don’t think you can rule it out because we’re stuck.” As PM, he held three ­referendums in five years – a  poll on electoral reform, a  Scottish independence ballot and Brexit. Speaking about his personal relationship with Mr Johnson, Mr Cameron said: “We’ve had issues. “Even before Brexit there were tensions and ­disagreements but, on the whole, we’ve got on well.” He also laid into Mr Johnson for axing  Tory rebels who voted against his no-deal bid and for suspending Parliament to avoid ­scrutiny over his plans. He said: “Taking the whip from MPs and sharp practices using prorogation of Parliament have rebounded. I didn’t support either of those things.”Mr Cameron said he contacted his successor Theresa May as she ­negotiated with Brussels while boxed in by her self-imposed red lines on the withdrawal agreement.He added: “I remember frequently texting her about the frustration of getting a Brexit deal and then seeing Brexiteers vote it down possibly at the risk of the whole project they had devoted themselves to. Maddening. And infuriating. There’s an argument that Brexit is just impossible to deliver and no one could have done, and there’s an argument that, well, wrong choices were made.” As Mr Cameron prepares for his book launch, Mr Johnson was askedhe was worried about what would be written about him in it. The PM, who branded Mr Cameron a “girly swot” in leaked papers, replied: “Absolutely nothing that David Cameron says in his memoirs will diminish the affection and respect in which I hold him.” Cameron on Gove Michael Gove is branded a liar by Mr Cameron and described as “mendacious” over things he said during the referendum campaign. He said: “I think what I say is that over the issue of whether or not we had a veto over Turkey, and over the issue of the £million on the bus, I think they left the truth at home.” Askedthe pair are still speaking, Mr Cameron said: “We’ve spoken. Not a huge amount. I’ve sort of had a conversation with him. I’ve spoken to the Prime Minister a little bit, but Michael was a very good friend. So that has been more dficult.”  aposIssuesapos with Boris David Cameron has spoken candidly about his relationship with Boris Johnson. The former Prime Minister said of the current Premier: “We’ve had issues.” He paints a damning picture of Mr Johnson as someone who would arrive late at vital emergency COBRA meetings. Mr Cameron also explained how he tried to pe rsuade his friend to back Remain by suggesting he was likely to succeed him in No . He also offered him a top-five Cabinet job – hinting at the position of Defence Secretary.

I was horried and straightaway I didnapost want anything to do with the dairy products, because I thought,I couldnapost cope with watching it happen, but I was buying the product, I was inadvertently funding it, Jacqui, , told Cornwall Live .All of the kids have made their own decisions and have recognised why they are vegan. Some parents say aposyouaposre not having that and thatapos, but we wanted the kids to understand why we do it, take on the information and decide for themselves.    But Jacqui, from Probus, Cornwall, conceded people still remain uneducated about veganism and, as a result, sheaposs lost friendships. The mum-to-three added: When I started posting about it and raising awareness, I lost all of my friendships - because they were telling me to be quiet about it. Ryan, who is a teaching assistant, said: There is nothing in schools now to teach kids where their food comes from, how it is slaughtered and the process and all of that kind of stuff. So for me, posting was the most powerful thing I could do, I could get things out on social media for people to see and read.I got grief from friends back in the Midlands, where I grew up, saying this is not what Facebook is about, stop with the dead images of animals and share family photos instead.   Trolls even went as far to tell Ryan he was disrespecting the memory of his father, who was a butcher, and the couple havenapost spoken to Jacquiaposs sister in over a year, who she used to be really close to. Jacqui, who is a nutritionist, said: There seems to be some kind of ide where people meet vegans with aggression and resistance when you are just trying to raise awareness about practices that people should know about. The kids have even been bullied at school. Skipp, , decided to become vegan after watching The Land of Hope and Glory, a documentary about the UKaposs farming practices. The teenager, who claims he regularly has meat waved in his face at school, said: A dairy farmeraposs child argued with me that a calf doesnapost need to be born for milk to be made, and I was made to look stupid because obviously everyone will believe the farmeraposs son over me. Top tips by Clare Francis, Savings and Investment Director at Barclays. Balance eating out with staying in Dining out regularly adds up and restaurant meals are much more expensive than those you would cook for yourself. View dining out as a treat and make sure that you budget for these special occasions accordingly. Cook in Batches When preparing your meals, bigger is definitely better as by cooking in batches you’ll not only save yourself money, but also the hassle of preparing inidual meals each day! If you are out and about, why not prepare yourself some healthy snacks to take with you such as protein balls or raw chocolate bars.DIY Vegan staples such as almond milks and cashew butters can all be made at home for a fraction of the price. While it will require more time and effort, the savings you will make in the long-term will make it even more worth it and making them in batches will help you get more for your money. Buy in Season Fruit and vegetables are key components of a vegan diet, but buying fresh produce out of season can put a huge dent in your bank balance. Try to avoid the mark up by keeping your shopping list seasonal, or you look in the freezer aisle to seeyou can favourite products any time of the year. Plan before you head out to the shops Try planning your food shopping for the week ahead, this will make sure that you only buy what you need for meals, rather than spending money on items that might go unused. Shopping on a full stomach also helps you make better decisions and stick to budget. If you have time, why not do some research into which stores near you stock your essentials at the cheapest price. Buy in bulk Purchasing products in bulk is a great way to save money, especiallyyou regularly cook for family and friends. Often you will find that the larger packages are cheaper by weight and you won’t need to buy them as often! Look out for the unit price on packaging. This will tell you the exact cost per gram, litre etc, which makes it easy to compare between products and choose the cheapest option. Grow whatever, wherever you can Fresh produce can be expensive, especiallyyou are regularly picking up herbs. Why not create your own vegetable patch or grow your basil and coriander on your windowsill – just don’t forget to water them!   My friends are supportive but people do view vegans as wanting to take down farmers, and I understand it because farmers are their families. Ryan, , admitted it was more dficult for him to make the change. The father, who grew up surrounded by the farming industry and was a frequent visitor to slaughterhouses, said: Dad was a highly respected farmer and neighbours would bring animals around to be skinned and plucked. So it wasnapost abnormal for me to be around dead animals for much of my le. I would help put animals on trailers and get the animals into the slaughterhouses and it was all normal to me. I witnessed chickens being killed on the farm, I worked on the turkey line just before Christmas and I always just thought aposwe need animals to be healthy and strongapos. But after Jacquiaposs mother was diagnosed with bowel cancer and Ryanaposs father passed away, the teaching assistant decided to change his diet.

British-Australian Kylie Moore-Gilbert is the third person named by the Australian Government this week to be in detention in prison in Iran. The Cambridge-educated academic who is now a lecturer in Islamic Studies at Melbourne University, has been in Tehranaposs notorious Evin prison for almost a year, having reportedly been given a -year sentence. She has published work on the  Arab uprisings and on authoritarian governments. Her case came to light this week along with those of another British-Australian woman, Jolie King, and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin, who have been held for the past  weeks in an unrelated incident. The Australian Government has said it is lobbying Tehran to ensure all three are appropriately cared for. The University of Melbourneaposs website lists Dr Moore-Gilbert on its Find an expert page as a lecturer at the universityaposs Asia Institute.    It says she specialises in Middle Eastern politics, with a particular focus on the Arab Gulf states, and that she had published work on the  Arab uprisings, authoritarian governance, and on the role of new media technologies in political activism. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on Saturday released a statement from Dr Moore-Gilbertaposs family, which said: We have been and continue to be in close contact with the Australian Government. Our family thanks the Government and the University of Melbourne for their ongoing support at this distressing and sensitive time. We believe that the best chance of securing Kylieaposs safeis through diplomatic channels. We will not be making any further comment and would like to request that our privacy - and that of our wider family and friends - is respected at this time. Although Iranian authorities have not made public the charges against Dr Moore-Gilbert, -year sentences have regularly been dealt in the country to those convicted of spying. While news of the trioaposs incarcerations only surfaced this week, Australiaaposs Foreign Minister Marise Payne says she has raised their cases many times with her Iranian counterpart Javad Zar. And Senator Payne has denied the arrests were politically motivated, although some reports have speculated the trio are being held in hope of giving Iran political leverage on a number of ongoing disputes with the western countries. We have no reason to think that these arrests are connected to international concern over Iranaposs nuclear programme, United Nations sanction enforcement or maritime security concerning the safety of civilian shipping, Senator Payne said. News of the three prisoners this week has come amid a downturn in relations between Britain and Iran, sparked by issues including the Royal Marinesapos seizure near Gibraltar in July of an Iranian oil tanker, the Adrian Darya .

His family have spoken out for the first time about the tragedy which happened seven years ago, in February .  And it comes as Joeaposs sister, Holly, has successfully managed to source a le-saving defibrillator to be kept at her womanaposs football club stadium in Toxteth. Holly, , a teaching assistant in a special needs school, said: We were all starting to worry and around midnight we got a phone call to say that he had been found collapsed and taken to hospital where he passed away. “Joe had been diagnosed with a bicuspid aortic valve which has no symptoms and was totally undetected. “Had a defibrillator been nearby, Joe could have still been here with us now and received treatment.” The -year-old was a regular at his gym and had no known illnesses. His sister added: Joe was a popular lad, he loved to socialise, getting the mums up to dance, and loved his holidays and his designer clothes. After he died, we had people coming to the house, who had met him just once, telling us how they he had touched their lives. Joe was a young, fit man who had his whole le in front of him. It doesnapost make any sense. Holly has already managed to raise cash for defibrillators which are now housed at Mossley Hill Athletics Club, Wavertree Athletics stadium and at an Everton in the Community site. His family have been told how Joeaposs death would have been like the flick of a switch, with him feeling a bit faint before he fell unconscious. The defibrillator in his honour, donated by a washroom products company, will be kept at Admiral Park in Toxteth, the home stadium of Merseyrail Ladies. The club is sponsored by the local rail operator who have defibrillators in every single one of their stations. Paul Bowen, deputy managing director of Merseyrail, said: “We are incredibly proud to sponsor and work so closely with such a pioneering club as Merseyrail Ladies FC. Women’s football is the fastest growing sport in the country and it is a pleasure to be able to support a team that represents the game so well. At Merseyrail we are committed to the safety of - not only our passengers - but the wider community, and value the importance of the availability of defibrillators across the region. Holly added: It’s amazing that the club have supported our awareness raising and have now got their own defibrillator. People are now taking notice – I think it has hit home because Joe was so young, fit and healthy.

It’s shown the tough time many communities are having. But it’s told stories of wonderful people too. Hardworking, honest people with pride in their home towns – despite today’s problems. They give me hope for the future. But they desperately need a new deal. Many of these towns were once powerhouses of industry. They made Britain a wealthy nation and offered good working-class jobs you could build a le on. But when those industries closed, the jobs that replaced them were low-paid and insecure.  Then after the financial crisis, communities that were already down took another a kicking from a decade of austerity.It’s time to do right by our towns again. They need decent, solid jobs and world-class public services.We want to hear stories from your town. What do you think about it  Are you facing any issues  Email webnews@mirror or call       There’s an election coming, so my message to all the parties is this. Firstly, invest in our towns to attract good employers and create decent jobs. That means modern transport links and new centres of green industry across the UK. We can win the battle against climate change and create great new jobs while we’re at it. And we need a National Investment Bank to target investment to towns where good jobs are in short supply.Secondly, the next government must rebuild public services.  Austerity has done deep harm to Britain. And the worst damage is to towns that were already struggling.Every town needs good schools and hospitals, safe neighbourhoods and truly affordable homes. So in this election, let’s hear about long-term plans to fund all of our services properly. And that means restoring what was cut in full. Finally, politicians must give back power to workers.The industries that once made these towns wealthy had strong unions. But in recent decades, working people have been silenced.

Nothing was the same.  “I did grieve a lot, I was very angry and out of control, breaking everything up and taking my temper out on people.  “It still sticks with me now.”    Despite his struggles, Aaron said he was “too stubborn” to try and speak to someone and tried to deal with his issues alone.  “You feel like you’re the only one in that circle or bubble that you’re in who knows anything about it. It’s quite personal so opening up to people takes a while,” he said.  “When I did speak to people I felt no one really took it on board, they tell you: ‘yeah, you’ll be alright’. But you don’t really say that to someone.” After finishing his studies Aaron went to work in Calais where he had an eight-month contract working for an activity centre.  But his mental health started to decline when his contract wasn’t renewed.  He said: “I just gave up because I hated everything and nothing was going right for me. I came back to my parents but I didn’t like it.  “So I ended up on the streets. I was depressed before and then that spiked it.”  He said he felt helpless and ashe had no one to turn to while he was homeless.  “I struggled to hold down a job too, I had a part-time job working two hours every morning and I was still doing it even though I was living in a tent,” he explains. “It was hard to stay clean like washing your clothes, and obviously you have from place to place because as soon as people know who you are they can come and trash it so you need to keep on top of that.  “So you’re constantly having to move place and I was asking my family membersI could move in but no one would.  “It felt like I was the black sheep of the family, that they were just pushing me away.” After spending two months living rough, Aaron went to Citizens Advice who helped him find a place to stay at the YMCA. He said: “It takes the pressure of trying to look after yourself, there’s regular meals but I struggle with looking for work because of my depression.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i saved dog buddy found","story":"NewsI saved dog Buddy when I found him dying - then he helped me survive tragedyNicola Owst tells the uplting story of a rescued dog who repaid his owners careShareCommentsByNicola Owst:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsPoor Buddy was close to death when Nicola found him abandoned \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email When Nicola Owst found a Staffordshire bull terrier abandoned and close to death she didn’t think twice about saving him. But what she didn’t know then was that her new buddy would save her too – by freeing her from her past. The brave dog would also go on to become a social media star and capture the hearts of dog lovers everywhere. Here, in an extract from her new book, Saving Buddy, Nicola shares their story of survival, hope and love.His poor sad eyes were just slits in his bony, bruised face and just trying to keep them open was causing him intense pain. The skin around his filthy, swollen muzzle was pockmarked and livid pink where his fur had worn away. Blood under his right eye had soaked down his face and neck and on to his body, and his skeletal bird-like legs showed every sinew.  He was barely alive and every movement was agonising for him. It was April  and I’d travelled from Leicestershire with my stable-owner friend, Sally, and her daughter, Charlie, to collect two unwanted foals from a couple of shady-looking men in a junkyard just outside London. We’d just finished loading the horse-box when Charlie spotted a dog wedged into a cat carrier, inside a rusty crate. He was barely breathing – clinging on to le. So I freed the cat box and carefully lted him out of his prison. He was some kind of staffy and his terribly scared face showed he’d endured the most dreadful mistreatment. Had he been in illegal dog fights  He’d been left to die in his own waste. The stench of rotting flesh and faeces was unbelievable. His paw pads were red raw from standing in his own urine. What sort of monster could leave an animal is such a state  When I lted his limp body on to my lap, his legs buckled beneath him. I gently swaddled him in a towel. “I’ve got you now, buddy,” I whispered to him. And from that moment on he was known as Buddy.  We set off home but I feared he might not survive the journey and kept saying “Hang in there, Buddy.” We drove straight to the vet who took one look at Buddy and shook his head. It was the worst case of neglect he’d ever seen. Buddy was riddled with demodectic mange. The infection had eaten his skin and his weakened immune system meant he couldn’t fight it. The next  hours would be critical. Armed with antibiotics and a treatment for his skin, we went home. I half-filled the kitchen sink with water, added anti-bacterial shampoo and lowered Buddy in. I gently bathed away the foul dirt and grime as he sat there, placidly. Bit by bit, his lovely, splodgy brown and black brindle markings became clearer, and the real Buddy started to be revealed. This was possibly the first tender care he’d ever been given. I talked to him the whole time, telling him what a brave boy he was. It broke my heart to think about how scared he must have been, abandoned in that crate to die. Once he was clean, I wrapped him up in a big fluffy towel and patted him dry. I then cooked him some mini-fillets of chicken and a sachet of rice. I knewhe ate something, he would stand a better chance of making it through the night. Next morning Buddy seemed perkier. He tried to stand and walk towards me like a wobbly Bambi, but his back legs were too weak and his paws were agony. I went to Asda and bought some baby socks, padded the soles with cotton wool to cushion his paw pads and kept them on with sticky tape. The next time he wobbled on to his feet, he stayed upright for a few more seconds. It was a step in the right direction. And I did some research on Staffordshire bull terriers and was reassured to read they’re a lot softer than their fearsome reputation suggests.    I was going through a break-up at the time and, looking back, it feels asBuddy was sent to give me new focus. I needed help too. I felt very raw and vulnerable, unwanted and rejected. The moment Buddy looked at me with those pleading eyes, I knew he wanted me as much as I wanted him. By healing him, I was healing myself of heartache. I rescued Buddy that day but he also rescued me. Day by day he grew stronger and started to put on weight, but it was a long process. The raw, pink boy I’d rescued started to sport a summer coat. As I massaged his velvet-soft ears, he’d close his eyes in pleasure and wag his tail. I didn’t feel alone as I was so unconditionally loved by my little ball of energy. I had spent so long with loser boyfriends and shed too many tears when relationships had failed. But now I had a fantastic companion who’d be there for me through thick and thin. I was a manager at a job centre and in July  we got some new recruits. We were a similar age and got on well and would all go out for a drink. One of them, Jon Owst, was really nice and I enjoyed chatting to him. He was tall with dark hair, lovely blue eyes and a kind way – eager to hear all about my twin passions: Buddy and horses. We became friends and, six months later, Jon asked me on a date. It was lovely, but I’d gone on about Buddy so much Jon could be in no doubt it was a case of love me, love my dog. To my surprise he asked me out again and we took Buddy to the park. It was a fantastic day – the start of something special. Jon was a breath of fresh air and quickly became a new dad to Buddy. It made me realise how self-centred my recent ex-boyfriend had been. Buddy made me realise le is too short to be with someone who only cared about themselves. In August  Jon popped the question and presented me with a beautul ring. I said yes, straight away. We got married on Easter Sunday, . Our wedding was perfect. Buddy had a gorgeous garland of flowers in the coral wedding colours and he starred in many of the wedding photos.    But two years later I was cuddling Buddy and noticed a hard swelling on his back left ankle – the size of a large broad bean. The vet didn’t think it looked sinister. But I had a niggling feeling it was serious and Jon insisted I take Buddy back to the vet. He sent Buddy for an X-ray and “to have some cells tested.” I went into panic, worrying Buddy had cancer. Five days after the tests the vet rang. And the only word I heard was “tumour”. I couldn’t bear it, not after everything we’d been through, after his terrible start in le. Jon hugged me and tried to put my mind at rest. We went to the surgery. The vet said the tumour was in an awkward place and Buddy needed an specialist. Whatthe cancer had spread into Buddy’s leg. Would it mean amputation to save his le  The op went well. But the surgeon wasn’t % certain he’d removed all of the tumour. Buddy had to have radiotherapy and eight doses of chemotherapy. But how were we going to pay for it  I’d got pet insurance after rescuing Buddy, but with cancer costs rocket and there was very little in the pot.   I was desperately worried. We hadn’t been in our new house long and had no savings. But I’d created a Facebook page called Buddy Dog – The Rescue Staffy, to spread the word that staffies are lovely dogs.I posted about his treatment and the more I shared, the more Buddy’s friends increased.Friends suggested I set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds towards the treatment. And, amazingly, within weeks, we had raised the £ needed. When Buddy had his final round of chemo it was such a relief. It looked as though he would again be the incredible personality we knew and loved. But during Buddy’s cancer scare, we found out I was expecting. I had terrible morning sickness and Buddy knew there was something wrong with me. He’d sit next to me with his head tilted, a worried frown on his face. And I told him everything – as I always had. But eight weeks into the pregnancy, I woke up and sensed something was wrong. I turned to Jon and said: “I think the baby’s gone.” A scan confirmed it two days later, I had an operation to have the pregnancy removed. I was terribly upset but knew it wasn’t uncommon. A few months later I was pregnant for a second time – but miscarried again early on. When it happened a third time I was utterly devastated. Surely there must be something wrong with me  But the gt of morning sickness was delivered again, in the autumn of .

He did compare himself to how others were doing on social media and this was an added pressure but I feel at that what happened was totally out of character for Jacob. At the time of his death he wasn’t in his right mind for whatever reason and I feel that he wanted to be out of pain in that moment - I firmly believe that. “When he left the house he was dressed in shorts and a hoodie and he hated the cold and I believe he was going back to Ciera to sort things out.aposapos "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle prince harry build","story":"NewsMeghan Markle and Prince Harry build £, barbecue area at Frogmore CottageThe Duke and Duchess of Sussexs £.million renovation includes the outdoor area for entertaining guests, it is claimedShareCommentsByRichard Percival:,  SEP NewsThe £, area will be used to entertain guests, the source said \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Lottie Fellows is like most other -year-old woman studying accounting and finance at the University of Bath, accept that she has a lucrative side hussle. She uploads videos of herself whispering onto Youtube, where some have fetched as many as , views. Lottie is a master in the art of autonomous sensory meridian response or ASMR. When some people hear a voice whispered so as to be on the cusp of audible, they get a tingling sensations in parts of their body. The noise can make some feel relaxed and sleepy or, alternatively, very on edge.    For Lottie, her relationship with ASMR began in primary school, when a teacher softly reading her class a book gave her the tingles. Her mum put her onto the then emerging whispering scene in early , suggesting the student might be able to harness it to improve her mental health and sleep. As soon as she watched on video she was hooked. Lottie made her own channel in September of that year.    At first her subscriber count grew slowly as she struggled with the filming and editing process. A year on however, she has , subscribers and millions of views split across  videos. “I was shocked when my channel began to grow, it was very surreal, she said. “I remember watching my videos back and cringing a bit, so knowing others were enjoying it was a surprise.” In her videos Lottie greets her viewers by whispering hello my darlings.    She then adopts a character, whether that be a doctor or a stylist. While the aim of the video is to sooth and relax, some people have misinterpreted the sensual display Lottie offers as sexual. “When people say ASMR is sexual I respond with the argument that anything can be sexualized, she said.  I can understand why slow whispering or the words ‘roleplay’ can be misinterpreted as being sexual, and there are some female creators who show a bit of cleavage to get more views.

He is my best friend.” Maryanne and Tommy then moved in with Linda before getting their own flat, next door, in .   Linda says: “They would talk all the time, from the moment they woke up to the moment they went to sleep. I had to bang on the wall because they’d be in hysterics. “They also cooked with me every night and I taught them the basics of how to make fresh dinners. These two are marvellous in the kitchen. That’s where Tommy gets into his element.” When we visit Tommy and Maryanne in their flat, their pride shines through. Maryanne says: “I clean it every day.” The couple’s love for music is also apparent, as the apartment is crammed with Elvis memorabilia. There is even wallpaper with the King’s face and a cuckoo clock that plays his songs. So it comes as no surprise when Tommy sings Love me Tender to his we. “I sing this to her every day,” he says. “I sang it when we got married too.”    Maryanne nods while cradling a heart-shaped locket containing a photo of them with their names engraved. The couple renewed their vows on their th wedding anniversary in , in front of  people. And every year, they are keen to celebrate their anniversary and show the world their love. But devastatingly, Tommy may not be able to remember their th anniversary next year. He was diagnosed with dementia five years ago and already struggles to do day-to-day tasks like tying his shoelaces or washing his hair.Heartbreakingly, he also sometimes forgets who Maryanne is. If he continues to decline, her family fear they may be forced to separate for the first time.    Maryanne’s sister Lindi Newman, , says: “He’s forgotten who Maryanne is a handful of times. He pushes her away and says, ‘I don’t know who you are’ and ‘I don’t love you’.Maryanne takes that to heart and is hysterical. She calls me and I go across the road to calm them down. It’s scary for Tommy too but then he forgets anything has happened. “We tell her Tommy forgets things because his brain’s a bit poorly and he’s getting older.But we take each day as it comes because we’ve been toldTommy needs residential care, Maryanne wouldn’t be able to go with him. We’d do whatever we could to stop it happening.” Maryanne is also determined to do everything she can to help Tommy. Lindi says: “Tommy can’t put his own shoes on or fasten his jewellery or watches. Maryanne also helps him in and out of the bath, helps get him get dressed and things like that.”Maryanne chips in: “I tell him I love him three times a day. We have kisses and cuddles. I do all I can.” And this is clear to see when we head to the beach, as she grabs Tommy’s hand and leads him in the right direction. “Come on, Tom,” she grins as they point out their favourite lunch spots and pubs. “We just like spending time together,” she adds. “Sometimes we get an ice cream and a shandy.” And when Tommy stumbles, Maryanne is right there to support him. “Easy, tiger,” she laughs as she steadies him.  The pair are working to make new memories and will go to Disneyland this summer with Lindi and her family. Lindi says: “Next year, when Maryanne and Tommy reach  years, my husband and I will have been married  and my mother-in-law and father-in-law  – so we have a huge celebration planned with all the family going on holiday.Every year they have together is special and we make the most of it. And I always take lots of photos and have them put into an album for Tommy to help his memory.”Devoted Tommy and Maryanne have also won the hearts of , Facebook followers.Lindi says: “There’s just so much love that comes through there. Tommy and Maryanne have set the bar throughout their relationship. It’s literally a fairytale."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast summer comes","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Summer comes to an end with C blast before temperatures coolTemperatures will reach C on Sunday - while the far north of Scotland faces mph windsShareCommentsByTfany Lo:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video saturday-weather-mostly-warm-sunny-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Broganaposs condition gradually got worse and she started to suffer from generalised seizures up to  times per day. The horric symptoms meant could not be left alone with food as she would often choke.  The seizures also caused Brogan to have dangerous accidents with one resulting in  stitches to her face. Brogan said: At one point I was having up to  seizures a day and was having accidents. One time I was washing up, we had porcelain plates that everyone has and I had seizure. The plate broke and cut my face and I had to have  stitches. I have a scar, but you can hardly see it as the facial surgeon did an amazing job. There was also the time I had a kettle in my hand and had a seizure. I poured the boiling water all over myself and burnt myself. Due to her condition, Brogan was unable to have a bath due to the possibility of her drowningshe had a seizure. She was also not able to shower unsupervised as that too became a drowning hazard when she blocked the plug with her shoulder during one episode. However, Broganaposs le changed when she got her seizure alert dog, Wadsley. She said: “My le before Wadsley was miserable and I was depressed as hell.    “I was on medication but it wasn’t working, nothing was working. I knew what le was like before and I wanted that back. I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t have a bath or a shower in case I had a seizure and drowned or fell and banged my head. I couldn’t cook or leave the house, so many of things that people take for granted I wasn’t allowed to do any more. Brogan applied to Support Dogs, a charity that provide, train and support specialist assistance dogs when she was -years-old. However, due to huge demand the programme was closed at that time and she didn’t hear anything for two years. After applying to a number of charities, Brogan was about to give up on her chance of getting a seizure alert dog. However, that week she received a phone call from Support Dogs saying they had a Labrador who could be trained to pick when Brogan was about to have a seizure via his sense of smell. They claim the amazing dog can give Brogan a  and a half minute warning before she has an episode. This allows the -year-old to either get home or get to a safe place quickly before she has a seizure, whether that is a disability toilet or changing room. Her new found independence thanks to Wadsley allows Brogan to play rugby with the consent of her GP. She said: Wadsley can still detect a seizure even though he can’t see me.

It’s harder for the defence when you move it quickly from side to side because there will be a gap in the defence some time.“As well as moving it quicker, you have to be patient to wait for that gap to appear.”Marshall was given a break by manager James McPake for the - Challenge Cup defeat to Elgin City last Sunday and is keen to get back on the pitch come tomorrow.“I wasn’t playing on Sunday, the gaffer said I could head home and see some family and get a rest, but when I came back the feeling was positive around the place, to be honest,” he added.“I don’t think we need to dwell too much on it. We’ve had a couple of bad results but it’s happened, it’s over and it’s about putting it right tomorrow.“If you look over the whole start to the season, it’s been a decent start.“The derby was obviously a night to forget but we have three more derbies this season and we’ll be looking to put that right later on in the season.”On being rested, he added: “I want to be playing every week but we have a good squad with two good players for every position. The gaffer needed to see Sean Mackie play as well so, fair enough, I respect his decision.“It’s always good to have a bit of competition.”Dundee picked up six clean sheets in their opening eight matches of the season and rediscovering that will be key to getting back to form, says Marshall.Their inability to deal with set-pieces at Tannadice, too, took the left-back by surprise two weeks ago and the former Queen of the South man revealed improving that has been a key part of training lately.He added: “We’d kept a few clean sheets already this season and then conceding six was unacceptable, particularly at this club.“We need to get back to being solid and doing the basics right like we were doing when we were picking up so many clean sheets. We’ve been working on our set-pieces.“Usually we’ve been pretty solid from them this season.

I see more games over there than I did here so it’s good to keep tabs on all the boys.”This week Russell was on Scotland duty as he earned his th international cap during the - home defeat to Belgium.The forward was used as a late subsitute by manager Steve Clarke.And, despite the disappointment of bruising defeats at home to Russia and Belgium, Russell insists there is much more to come from the national side.Askedthe Scots were moving in the right direction under Clarke, Russell said: “Definitely.“We have a young, hungry squad with a lot of quality players throughout the team.“That’s the frustrating part because we should be doing better but, for whatever reason, it’s not quite working at the minute.“It’s still quite new under the new manager.“He’s obviously trying to get his ideas across and get to know everybody as well.“There are new ideas but everyone is pulling in the same direction and, despite the disappointing results, it is good to be part of it.”Losing to Belgium, the world’s top-ranked team, wasn’t a surprise but Russell feels frustrated at the nature of the goals that cost the Scots.He said: “It was always going to be dficult against that level of opposition.“The goals we gave away we wouldn’t expect to give away which was disappointing.

It was frustrating on our part to give that one away and then lose goals from two crosses as well.“We wanted to get out of the group but the reality is that’s not going to happen so it’s all about fighting and showing the quality we have and gaining some momentum into the remaining matches.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/04/5ca782c128b426.92555529.jpg ","title":"one year on what do the public think of the va dundee","story":"One of the most searched questions on the internet about Dundee is: “how did Dundee get the VA ”But in the year since it opened, the museum, designed by Kengo Kuma, has proven not only to be a huge coup for the city, but a key cultural development.On the eve of the big opening day last September, the world’s media descended on the city as Primal Scream headlined at Slessor Gardens followed by a stunning fireworks display and light show.For many who were there that night or watched proceedings on the BBC, it felt like a watershed moment for Dundee.The Earl and Countess of Strathearn arrived in January to offically open the building, while Fiona Bruce and the Antiques Roadshow team were in town in June to film an episode of the long-running show.As the VA prepares to celebrate its first birthday tomorrow with a series of daytime events for families and a talk from its Japanese architect, we took to the streets to ask people how they thought Scotland’s first design museum had fared in its first  months.For -year-old Mel Hawthorn, who was born in Dundee but now lives in Essex, the museum is a “fantastic” asset.She said: “Lots of tourists are actually coming into Dundee now. I was born here and the changing environment is fantastic.“It has brought more culture and it’s a big statement. Structure wise, it’s breathtaking.”Retired factory worker Dermot O’Sullivan, said: “I think it’s great for the city and great publicity. I was disappointed to see on television that it was compared to a ‘grim car park’. I couldn’t agree with that.”“I don’t know how they managed to get it here, but I think they’re really fortunate. With the only other one being in London, we’ve done well for ourselves.”Jim Coupar from Coldside said: “I think the VA has been great for Dundee. It’s brought in visitors and money for shops too which is absolutely brilliant.”Elizabeth MacKinnon, who runs an archery centre, said: “For us, it was actually quite disappointing. We couldn’t understand why there was not more to highlight the DC Thomson print and printworks, which is a huge part of Dundee.“The content was disappointing and there was a lack of  anything to keep an -year-old and an -year-old happy.”And Ricky Grfith said: “It was built up to be this big European museum and I think it’s been overrated.“I’m not saying it’s a terrible building, but it’s not European status. It’s not the Guggenheim or anything like that.“There was excitement before it opened about the development around it and I don’t see that that’s happened either.”In an Eveningonline poll the majority of readers were broadly in favour of the museum.Out of the , people who voted,  said they “loved” the building and  saying that they “liked” it.But a less enthusiastic  people said they disliked the museum and  “hated” it.Many praised the “outstanding architecture”, but said the interior was disappointing.Dundee City Council leader John Alexander said: “VA Dundee has helped to boost the international profile of our city, encouraging people to visit this amazing new museum and our other well-established attractions.“The city’s partners have a long-term vision to create local jobs and opportunities through investment in top-class facilities like VA Dundee and the latest economic impact figures show this is already paying off, with record-breaking tourism numbers recorded in .“I’m delighted to help our design museum celebrate its first birthday as we look toward to what can be achieved in the years to come.”Caroline Warburton, VisitScotland regional leadership director said: “Since opening the VA Dundee has been on a phenomenal journey, shining a global spotlight on Dundee and cementing its place as a city of design, creativity and heritage.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/pressandjournal/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/07/graphicupdated.jpg ","title":"pop rockers the 1975 announce scottish gig with tickets on sale later this month","story":"English pop rock band The  have announced they will play a Scottish gig next year.The chart-topping band will play Aberdeen’s new entertainment venue PJ Live.The four-piece are headed for the Granite City and will bring their tour to the world-class arena on February .PJ Live bosses say they expect tickets for the gig to sell-out quickly.Head of entertainment, exhibitions and marketing Louise Stewart said: “We look forward to bringing another new act to PJ Live.\" width\"\" \"\" src\"https:www.youtube embed WlBDPegc featureoembed#enablejsapi#originhttps:wpcluster.dctdigital\" frameborder\"\" allow\"accelerometer autoplay encrypted-media gyroscope picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen“The  are known for their innovative synth-laden take on ’s pop rock.“We know our north-east fans always create great atmosphere at live gigs, and expect this to sell quickly.”Forming in , the band#s line-up consists of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Matt Healy, lead guitarist Adam Hann, bassist Ross MacDonald and drummer George Daniel.Following the release of the group’s first EP Facedown in ,  they attracted a huge following, before releasing their self-titled debut album in .The band’s second album I Like It When You Sleep, For You Are So Beautul Yet So Unaware Of It, was released in  and topped the charts in the UK and US.

However, the city council said this could be reviewed at a later date.It is understood from sources close to the project that work should begin on the smaller Newton of Charleston development, comprising just  homes, by the end of this year.Meanwhile, construction work could begin on the wider Loirston development by the “tail end” of next year or into .Officers at Aberdeen City Council have produced an updating planning framework for the area which will be presented to the local authority’s planning committee next week.They have been asked to agree putting the proposals out to public consultation to give residents the chance to have their say.Councillor Sarah Duncan, who represents Cove, Nigg and Kincorth, urged the public to have their say in any future consultation.She said: “It is essential the revised framework goes out for public consultation as any development around Loirston Loch is of signicant interest to people living in Nigg, Redmoss, Cove and Kincorth.“There have been changes in the area since the original framework was published, not least Lochside Academy and Balmoral stadium, so it’s appropriate now that local people can see what might happen and comment on that.”The city council’s planning committee will be asked to approve the content of the development framework and to agree that the proposals go out to public consultation for a minimum of four weeks.The views of the public consultation would then be reported back to a future meeting of the committee within the next six months."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 9 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe Egg Shed opening is big news for Mid Argyll.The development, as part of the wider Ardrishaig harbour improvements, can only be a good thing for the village.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"an album with atmosphere and depth","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowExtract of an album review by Marc HigginsThis striking album is a collaboration between singer songwriter Sheila K Cameron and John Saich and Mags Russell of Argyll#s Wild Biscuit productions.In  they collaborated on an album called More Like a River than a Road. These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain sensibly played short of the burn while Bruce had no option but to drive, splitting the fairway in the process leaving a  yard shot to the green. Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

With the world championship they also secured the Champion of Champions accolade for the fourth year in a row.The band#s success has been remarkable since being formed with Inveraray  youngsters just  years ago by current leaders Pipe Major Stuart Liddell and lead drummer Steven McWhirter. The band rose rapidly through the ranks, winning the world title, and many others besides, at every grade in which it competed.Inveraray is now established as the Grade  band to beat and players are attracted from around the world # but regardless of its international make-up, Inveraray still lies at its heart.That fact was clearly in evidence as the reception was crowned by a magical performance by the world champions, enjoyed by all and captured for posterity on the many mobile phones raised to the heavens.Speaking as he presented the quaich, Councillor MacMillan congratulated the band on its success, achieved in a relatively short period of time thanks to the dedication of all concerned.Argyll and Bute MP Brenan O#Hara said the band#s success has been #absolutely remarkable# and quipped that Inveraray#s success had turned him into a #born-again piper#, so inspired has he been.Pipe Major Stuart Liddell, Inveraray born and bred and from a line of superb pipers, said: #I want to thank all band members for their hard work over the past several years, and of course their families who have put up with so much and made sacrices for it to happen # particularly those with young families.

Last weekend, we were fortunate to be invited to an orchard in East Lothian to pick some apples.As we entered Lewis stopped for a moment and said ldquoWow.He has seen apples growing on trees before, but I think it was the sight of so many apple trees together all in fruit. It was a visual feast, even for me.And so we picked some apples, in the company of a friend who uses local fruits to make juices. Lewis just couldnrsquot decide which apple tree to pick from first. He wandered about in awe, eyeing the apples.There were many ieties in the orchard, but I sadly canrsquot remember all their names.ldquoI think Lewis is in paradise, I remarked as I watched him.ldquoWhatrsquos paradise  asked my nearly six-year-old inquisitive daughter Skye. I had to think about my answer.ldquoSome people say itrsquos a perfect place, but other people say itrsquos a perfect feeling.ldquoCan be both then, maybe at the same time Skye replied.I smiled and agreed. We both watched Lewis, as he wondered under the small trees, dancing with delight at the sight of so many delicious looking ripe apples.ldquoYea said Skye, ldquoLewis is definitely having paradykes.ldquoWe say in paradise I said, in a bit of a teachery tone.ldquoBut you can have it too insisted Skye ldquobecause itrsquos a happy feeling.How could I disagree  ldquoYoursquore right I smiled.ldquoThis one Lewis called out. The apple was just out of reach and so his sister ran up and carefully picked it for him, in the way she had been shown. Lewis studied the apple before eating, savouring the moment.He was indeed both in, and having, paradise.We collected a small basket full of apples of dferent ieties, and after giving our thanks we started our walk back to the car. As we meandered along the path Skye asked for a story about an apple.So I told the story of Johnny Appleseed. Then a riddle ldquoA wee roond hoose, sometimes red, sometimes green, the maist bent lum ye hae ersquoer seen. Nae windaes or doors tae open or slide, it has a secret, therersquos a star inside.The answer of course is an apple. The bent lumbeing the stalk, and the star being the seed core when the apple is cut horizontally through the middle.As we walked, I reflected on the symbolism of the apple, and how it has been used in folklore and legend. And of course there is the famous apple which fell on Newtonrsquos head.Well it probably didnrsquot really fall on his head, as that seems a later embellishment, but for sure Newton himself often told the tale of the falling apple and the inspiration it gave him. He lived well into old age, and I think he understood the power of a story to convey the meaning of an event or idea.We approached our car and I took my sonrsquos hand to keep him safe as we crossed the road.ldquoDad he said looking up at me, ldquoyou are my walking apple.I laughed at the image and wondered what he meant. Was he referring to my rotund body shape perhaps ldquoWhy am I your walking apple  I asked him.ldquoCause I love apples and you are walking with me he said, with a sense of poetic meaning only a young child can convey.I was momentarily overwhelmed by this simple but moving comment. Lewis, aged only four, conveyed a powerful symbolism for apples that morning.The apple falling from the tree in front of Isaac Newton was a symbol of scientic discovery. For my son, an apple is a symbol of love. And my son loves the apples he eats, and the ones which walk with him.

In particular we must make sure that those of us who must use older vehicles for employment purposes and who may have a lower income are not disadvantaged by this scheme.ldquoI would welcome investigations into measures such as vehicle scrappage schemes which could help ease this transition.Edinburgh City Council is currently consulting on proposals to introduce a city centre LEZ and extend it to city limits.It would mean people who drove older vehicles which did not meet the new emission standards into the zone would be fined.Concerns about the impact of a city-wide LEZ on East Lothian residents have been raised by council officials who warn it could lead to job losses and impact local businesses who required to delivery services in the city.However the local authority response to the consultation, which will be put before cabinet for approval on Tuesday, supports the general principles of the introduction of the zone.It includes conditions which, as well as calling for Musselburgh to be included in the zone, also call for the two local authorities to work together to make signposting of where the zone begins clear and look at ways of mitigating the impact on East Lothian communities."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-apply-thousands-pounds-support-charity","story":"Last year, donations were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UKs largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.The Gannett Foundation UK, which makes the grants, has given more than pound million to help charitable community causes all over Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland in the last  years.The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between pound, and pound,, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.Decisions in respect of the value of the funding will be made by the trustees and based on the evidence submitted.The foundation favours projects that demonstrate good planning, oversight and financial responsibility.

The first female marine engineer in the UK, she forged a gender-role-bending path. Only after persistently sitting the exam  times ndash and being rejected many of those times because she was a woman ndash did she become a chief engineer. Born at Megginch Castle, Perthshire, the god-daughter of Queen Victoria, she was from an early age interested in mechanics. Inspired by the machinery in the Robert Morton and Sons engineering works near her home, in , at the age of , she did an apprenticeship at the Northern Garage Perth. This would be followed by another apprenticeship at the Caledon Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, Dundee. During the Second World War, she served on the SS Bonita, which was attacked by enemy aircraft and was commended for her bravery and leadership. John Knox:Religious revolutionaryand educationalistJohn Knox was a pillar of the reformation. It was said by one English ambassador that to hear him preach was like was ldquohaving  trumpets blowing in onersquos ear. The sound of those trumpets still reverberates. We live in a Scotland in which that Presbyterian sensibility lingers, in which we, in spite of religious ersity and the waning of the Church of Scotland, are frequently caricatured as a Calvinist nation. Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Haddington, went on to become a firebrand prophet, railing against idolatry. His journey towards bringing the Protestant revolution to Scotland involved a period as slave in the French kingrsquos galleys and time in Geneva where he came under the instruction of John Calvin. His legacy, however, is more than the established Church of Scotland. It was an education system and the idea of universal schooling, as well as new ways of providing for the poor.He was also, many believe, a key influence in the American revolution. A black mark lingers against him for his misogynist rantings ndash though it should be said that his belief in the inferiority of women was typical of his time, and his famous First Blast Of The Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment Of Women was directed not at all women, but specically the Catholic queens. John Loudon McAdam:Road-making revolutionaryBorn into an aristocratic family, John Loudon McAdam moved to New York in , made his fortune there, and ed in . Then he started to experiment with road construction, dabbling with using roadstones in the building of a road from the local highway to his newly acquired estate. He would go on to write papers on the ldquoScientic Repair and Preservation of Roads.In , when he was appointed surveyor to the Bristol Turnpike Trust, he decided to remake the roads under his care with crushed compacted stone layers, shaped with a convex camber for drainage. It was the greatest revolution in road construction since Roman times. His roads were smoother, cheaper and longer-lasting.By the end of the th century most roads in Europe underwent what became known as macadamisation. McAdamrsquos brilliant idea is still there, albeit with a few adaptations including a bit of tar, beneath our wheels whenever we travel. Janet Keiller:Marmalade matriarchIn the th century, Janet Keillerrsquos husband, John, bought a cargo from a Spanish ship after it sought refuge from a storm, for the cake and sweetie shop they ran in Dundee. It happened to be loaded with Seville oranges and Keiller made good out of a bad lot by boiling them with sugar and making marmalade. By  the Keiller factory had begun manufacturing marmalade.Food writer William Sitwell states: ldquoJanet Keiller called her version Dundee Marmalade and it sold so well that it became a byword for Scotland, a key part of Scottish breakfast, a symbol of excellence, a matter of national pride.Did Keiller invent marmalade  The idea is much debated. The Spanish had been making something like it from quince for decades. One food historian created a stooshie in  when he suggested marmalade had been featured in English recipe books long before Keillerrsquos creation ndash though he did confess she was the first to mass produce it.But Three Chimneys chef Shirley Spear, creator of the hot marmalade pudding, retorted: ldquoThere are amazing recipes which go back hundreds of years. But I think marmalade as we know it today is more likely to have been of the kind that the Keillers made. Mary Somerville:Self-taught polymath and worldrsquos first scientistLong before Brian Cox or Sir Patrick Moore, there was Mary Somerville, a great populariser of science in general, but also her most favoured field, astronomy. In , she became the first person to be described in print as a ldquoscientist ndash since she was more than just a physicist or astronomer, but could not be called, the popular term of the time, a ldquoman of science.Much of her thinking was ground-breaking. It was Somerville, for instance, who inspired the discovery of Neptune, when she theorised that the dficulties in calculating the position of Uranus suggested that there may be another planet out there.Twenty years before Charles Darwin published The Origin Of Species, she was writing, in her book Physical Geography, of man being ldquoa fellow-inhabitant of the globe with other created things, yet influencing them to a certain extent by his actions, and influenced in .Itrsquos not just that she was a brilliant self-taught mathematician and scientist, but that she had a gt for communicating ideas. Somerville herself once wrote, ldquoI was intensely ambitious to excel in something, for I felt in my own breast that women were capable of taking a higher place in creation than that assigned to them in my early days. James Keir Hardie:Founder of early Labour partyLabour prime minister Clement Atlee once said, ldquoHardie was not only born of the working class, he remained of the working class. Few members of parliament had a greater effect upon the House of Commons than Keir Hardie. Before the end of the th century parliament consumed itself very little with the le of the common people. The turning point came at the end of that century and Hardie symbolised that change.Politics would not be what it is today without the man once described as the ldquoprophet and evangelist of Labour, Britainrsquos first working class and socialist MP, as well as the first leader of the Labour party, he was born in a one-room cottage in Lanarkshire, to an unmarried mother who was a servant. He was reputedly illiterate to the age of , and was working in the mines by the age of . Sir Sean Connery:ActorSean Connery has to be our greatest cinematic export. People magazine declared him ldquothe Sexiest Man of the th Century. In  he topped an American poll for the greatest British actor of all time. No other Scot has gone on to become quite the international Hollywood icon that Connery did. None has made Scottishness seem quite so suave. He was also the James Bond that defined Bond.It was Dana Broccoli, Albert ldquoCubby Broccolirsquos we, who identied him as the man for the role ndash appreciating not just his physique, but the fact that he ldquomoved like a panther.His Bond, the ladykiller, may seem like a dinosaur in the #MeToo era, but he still dazzles. Connery brought to Bond something meritocratic rather than aristocratic. He was a former milkman and bodybuilder, who grew up in a two-room Fountainbridge flat with an outside toilet. Connery might have worn a hairpiece in every Bond movie but he didnrsquot fade like many other matinee idols, as he greyed, but held the screen in maturity, clinching a supporting role Oscar in The Untouchables. In his biography, Being A Scot, the longtime backer of independence attributed his success to being Scottish. Isobel Wylie Hutchison: Poet, author, botanist, explorer and painterIsobel Wylie Hutchison walked across Iceland solo, when everyone was warning her not to. It has been said she was the first Scotswoman to travel in Greenland. In the s she journeyed as a lone woman across the top of Alaska and found herself marooned for seven weeks on a sandspit with a fur trader ndash then wrote a compelling memoir about it. In terms of inspirational women who lived outside the expectations of her age, she was a trailblazer. Rather than marry, Wylie Hutchison, who was brought up in Carlowrie Castle, devoted her le to travel and collecting rare plant species. When St Andrews University awarded her an honorary degree in , it was said that she displayed ldquothat indomitable spirit which defies hazard, danger and discomfort, and is the source of all great human achievement. Mary Queen of Scots: Tragic queen and female leaderMore than  years after her bloody execution, therersquos still something about Mary. Recent years have seen it made ldquowoke in a film starring Saorsie Ronan, and charted by historian Kate Williams in Rival Queens, an examination of Maryrsquos relationship with Englandrsquos Elizabeth I. Williamsrsquo book has been described as ldquothe great rivalry reimagined for the #MeToo generation. Why does she remain relevant In part, itrsquos that her story remains so compelling ndash its charged romance, the murder of her secretary and favourite David Rizzio, the killing of her husband Lord Darnley and her violent end. But also therersquos a fascination with the relationship between the two queens. As Kate Williams puts it, ldquoIf we look at her in terms of queenship, she engaged in many acts that Elizabeth was congratulated for ndash but Mary did the same and lost everything. James Watt:Inventor of steam engine and father of industrial revolutionIt was an idea that popped into his mind while he was out for a Sabbath stroll. When James Watt perfected the steam engine in the late th century, he was putting into place the key element that set off industrialisation. So many things followed on, including locomotives, steam-powered ships, factories of multiple types, the transformation of the then water-based cotton industry, Britainrsquos evolution as the first industrial country.It was a revolution that would ultimately lead to the biggest challenge we face today: climate change. Wattrsquos genius stroke was to separate the condenser of a steam engine from the piston cylinder. Later, he would develop the sun and planet gear ndash which could provide a circular motion, thereby powering a wheel, which would then be used in transport and spinning.He even created the unit, the horsepower, to show how strong his engine was by comparing it with the weight a group of ponies could lt. Such was his impact that Andrew Carnegie, in a  book on the inventor, estimated that ldquoin  the value of world industries dependent upon steam was thirty-two thousand millions of dollars, and that in  it had reached forty-three thousand millions of dollars. Elsie Inglis:First World War nurseWhen the Great War broke out and she applied to the Royal Army Medical Corp, Elsie Inglis received a letter back saying, ldquoMy good lady, stay home and sit still. But Inglis, who was one of the first women to graduate from the University of Edinburgh, and set up her own medical practice in , as well as a hospice for poor women, was not one for sitting still.She persuaded the Scottish and National Womenrsquos Suffrage Societies to fund women-run field hospitals, leading to the founding of the Scottish Womenrsquos Hospitals for Foreign Services in . She would be lauded by Winston Churchill as a ldquoheroine who will shine in history. Inglis and her team worked in Serbia, staying on when the Germans advanced and ultimately they were interned, working in a prisoner-of-war hospital.Her unit was sent home in , but she went out again later in the year to join Serbian troops in southern Russia. What it is believed Inglis already knew, but had told no one, was that she had cancer. While out there, she collapsed and sent a telegram home with the news, ldquoEverything satisfactory and all well except me.On the day she landed in Newcastle in , she stood to bid farewell to her Serbian staff, and collapsed. She died the next day. Irvine Welsh: A Burns for our timesIrvine Welsh hurled a grenade into mainstream literature when he published in  his uncompromising, gritty, yet wildly entertaining black comedy of junkies and lost souls in Edinburgh. Renton, Sick Boy, Begbie, Spudhellip you canrsquot live in Scotland and not know the characters. The Danny Boyle movie that followed, with its iconic poster, affirmed its place in global popular culture ndash and defined a new urban image of Scotland. It also created a new generation of stars, shooting Ewan McGregor into the stratosphere. Profane, intoxicating and written in Edinburgh vernacular, Welshrsquos book had a blazing energy. Not everyone loved it. It was, according to Lord Gowrie, the chairman of the Booker prize , rejected for the shortlist after two judges deemed it offensive. A  Scottish Book Week poll saw Trainspotting named Scotlandrsquos favourite book of the last  years. William Cullen: Inventor of refrigerationBefore fridges we had holes in the ground lined with straw and ice brought down from the mountains. We had to eat stuff immediately or cure it or ferment it. Ice harvesting was a huge business. Then, in , William Cullen, one of the most important figures at the Edinburgh Medical School, devised a method of cooling through using evaporation of a liquid, which would absorb heat from the area it had come off. He didnrsquot make an actual fridge ndash it would take an American inventor to do that ndash but he pioneered the principles in . Eight years later he did a public demonstration of articial refrigeration in which he used a pump to create a partial vacuum in a container of diethyl ether ndash the result was that the liquid boiled. That reaction absorbed heat from the surroundings and produced a small amount of ice. The process is now an essential part of what the author of Chilled, Tom Jackson, has called ldquothe cold chain, which links our perishable food back to the farmerrsquos fields. The refrigerator, as Jackson says ldquohas changed the way we live. Kirkpatrick Macmillan: Created the first bikeIn the early th century, there were no bikes but people did ride on wheeled vehicles called hobbyhorses, propelling themselves along by pushing off the ground with their feet. Dumfriesshire blacksmith Macmillan decided to craft one in his smithy ndash and added horizontal pedals, whose movements were transmitted by cranks to a rear wheel by connecting rods. Macmillanrsquos bike was hard work, but in June , he rode to Glasgow, in a trip that took two days and resulted in him being fined five shillings for mildly injuring a small girl who ran across his path. Macmillan didnrsquot patent his invention, or make any money out of it ndash it was others, like Gavin Dalzell of Lesmahagow, who copied it and did so. Author Gordon Irving, in his book, Devil on Wheels, describes Macmillanrsquos first run: ldquoThe villagers watched in total amazement as he lted his feet to the pedals and went whizzing down the rough highway, the first person anywhere in the world to ride on a velocipede... The bicycle as we know it today had been born. This simple piece of technology looks set to be more important as we are encouraged, in the interest of our fitness and for the sake of the planet, to get on our bikes. John James Rickard Macleod: Physiologist who discovered insulinIt wasnrsquot Aberdonian John James Rickard Macleodrsquos own idea that there was something in the pancreatic secretions that might be involved in controlling blood sugar levels and deficient in those with diabetes. That notion came from surgeon Frederick Banting. But without Macleodrsquos input ndash he was an expert in carbohydrate metabolism running a lab at the University of Toronto ndash the discovery might never have come about. Macleod was, along with Banting, awarded the Nobel prize for the breakthrough. It saved the le of a -year-old boy who was the first human test subject for insulin treatment. Almost a century on we are in the grip of a global pandemic, with rates predicted to rise by % by . Undoubtedly the lives of many millions more will be saved by insulin. Dame Sue Black: Forensic anthropologist and crime fiction inspirationSue Blackrsquos work led the way in human identication in conflict zones. Following her time as lead anthropologist for the British Forensics Team in Kosovo, she went on to provide assistance identying the dead in Thailand after the Indian Ocean tsunami of . Shersquos the great matriarch of forensics, and though she has now moved to Lancaster University, was responsible for setting up the ground-breaking morgue in Dundee and leading a revolutionary approach to forensics as head of the Centre for Anatomy and Human Identication at the University of Dundee. Plus, since they met on a radio show, she has been the forensic inspiration at the heart of crime queen Val McDermidrsquos works, the on-call expert who gives them their scientic grounding. Her book All That Remains, is a challenge to how we view death. ldquoI wanted, she has said, ldquoto show that death has dferent faces ndash scientic, emotional, even hilarious. We think wersquore expected to behave a certain way, but wouldnrsquot it be wonderful , with our last dying breaths, what we hear is people laughing and singing rather than crying  John Muir: Conservationist behind the national parks movement Adam Smith: Father of modern free market economicsAdam Smith brought us the idea of an economics based around the twin ideas of ldquopersonal interest and the ldquoinvisible hand of the market ndash and those principles have been at the heart of much capitalist thinking since, though he himself never used the term capitalism. Smithrsquos Wealth Of Nations is considered one of the most important contributions to economic thought, and it was based around a new idea of the economy, forged in contrast with the prevailing principles of mercantilism of his time. It was generated in th century Scotland, where Smith, who was friends with David Hume, the geologist James Hutton, the chemist Joseph Black, was at the heart of enlightenment thinking.One of the problems with Smithrsquos legacy is that we are often presented with this theory in a caricatured form. Yes, Smith was opposed to all laws and practices that tended to discourage production and increase prices. And, yes, at the heart of his thesis was the idea that an unregulated system would work because each person would try to maximise his or her benefit. But too often we are delivered that theory through the filter of the free-market fundamentalism of economists who followed, particularly the Chicago School. The wider scope of his moral philosophy is often omitted ndash his lamentations, for instance, on the potential social and moral ills of what he called ldquocommercial society. More and more now people are drawing attention to the concerns Smith had over inequality. As Nicola Sturgeon has put it, ldquoAdam Smith is sometimes misquoted, misrepresented by some of his, what I would describe as, ultra-free-market supporters. Adam Smith, yes, knew that personal interest was a motivator of human behaviour. But, you can see in the Wealth of Nations that Adam Smith also knew and wrote that no country, no economy, could be fully successfulmany of the people living within it were poor and we had inequality. So thatrsquos the real legacy of Adam Smith.We live in times of questioning about capitalism, of ain some countries, for instance Trumprsquos America, to a kind of neo-mercantilism. Are there still answers to be found in Smith  Many believe so. Jesse Norman, his biographer observes: ldquoHe has a vast amount to teach us, not merely about economics and markets and trade, but about the deepest issues of inequality, culture and human society facing us. Far from attacking Smith, we must turn to him again. For we cannot understand, or address, the problems of the modern world without him. Moses McNeil, Peter McNeil, Peter Campbell and William McBeath: Founding fathers of Rangers FCPeter McNeil and Moses McNeil, aged  and , and Peter Campbell and William McBeath, both , discussed the possibility of forming a team during a walk through West End Parkin March . The club that has won  Scottish championships essentially started as a street team by a group of boys who had been smitten by the latest sporting craze of association football. They were joined in their endeavours by Tom Vallance, later to become a legendary Rangers captain, but who was then barely  years old.The group called their team ldquoRangers, having seen the name of a Swindon-based rugby club in an English Rugby Football Annual. Their triumph was to be the foundation stone of a Scottish institution. Rangers played their first ever match against Callander FC at Flesherrsquos Haugh on Glasgow Green in May , which resulted in a - draw. Moses McNeil played for the club he helped found for  years, taking part in the  and  Scottish Cup finals and being a member of the first Rangers side to lt a trophy, the Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in . Historians now consider that Peter McNeilrsquos greatest contribution to the formative years of the club was off the field after his playing days. As match secretary, a position he held until , he was in effect the clubrsquos first manager. His administrative skills were recognised in  when he became vice-president. Brother Walfrid: Celtic FC founderAndrew Kerins crossed the Irish Sea during the potato famine and settled in the east end of Glasgow in , aged . After taking up the oath with the Marist Brothers in France, he eventually became a teacher and was assigned to Sacred Heart School in the East End to cater for the childrenrsquos spiritual and educational needs. He established the ldquopenny dinner and set up a boysrsquo clubs, before spotting the potential of football, which had fast been gaining in popularity in the late th century, to raise money by attracting paying customers.During a meeting at St Maryrsquos Church hall in the Calton area on November  , with little fanfare , ldquothe Celtic was formed. It was intended to ldquosupply the East End conferences of the St Vincent De Paul Society with funds for the maintenance of the lsquoDinner Tablesrsquo of our needy children in the Missions of St Maryrsquos, Sacred Heart, and St Michaelrsquos. It is therefore with this principle object that we have set afloat the Celtic. Although formed to raise money for the needy of the East End who were mainly Catholic and Irish, the new club would be neither exclusively Catholic nor Irish. Walfrid remained a largely forgotten figure for much of the th century but in the late s as interest in the so-called ldquoIrish diaspora burgeoned there was renewed attention too on the man who did so many good works in Glasgow. A man who changed tens of thousands of Catholicsrsquo lives for the better and, through his enduring legacy, Celtic, tens of millions. Jackie Stewart: Formula One driver and safety advocateFrom mid- until his retirement at the end of , Sir Jackie Stewart was the undisputed number one and everyone knew it. As well as his unquestioned driving skills ndash  grand prix wins in  races and three world championships ndash this Milton-born legend championed safety in the sport and was the first to wear a seatbelt, insisted circuits should be lined by barriers and called for fire-resistant clothing. When it was called for, the Flying Scot, as he was known, led driver boycotts.Attitudes to safety were very dferent in the s and early s, and Stewart was vilied for his stance. But he didnrsquot care and his one-man safety crusade made the sport much safer. The catalyst for Stewartrsquos safety campaign was an accident he suffered in the  Belgian Grand Prix, when he was left trapped in an upturned car with fuel leaking out and was stuck for  minutes before being rescued. He also recalled counting  deaths while he was racing. Many were friends. ldquoSo many people were killed during that period, he said. ldquoThe only way I can relate to it, thinking back, is that it must have been like World War Two and the Spitfires and Hurricanes leaving the south coast of England to stop the German Luftwaffe. They were losing their colleagues on a regular basis. And so were we. Despite turning  this year, Stewart has not slowed down and is the founder of Race Against Dementia, a charity established to fight against the as yet incurable disease that his we, Lady Helen, suffers from. Mairi Mhor Nan Oran : Gaelic songstress and political campaignerMairi was born in March  at Skeabost on Skye, the daughter of a crofter. When she was about eight the family, following an abortive attempt to emigrate to Canada, settled in Glasgow ing to Skye some  years later. Mairi left in about  and went to Inverness where she married Isaac MacPherson in . After her husbandrsquos death in  she earned her living as a nurse. During this period she was accused of stealing clothing from her employer and imprisoned. She always protested her innocence and her bitterness at the injustice which she had suffered left a deep impression upon her.Upon her release from prison in  she went to Glasgow, where she underwent formal training as a nurse before going on to become a district nurse in Greenock. Her talent for Gaelic poetry and ability for storytelling made her socially and politically signicant in Glasgow. She became a focal point amongst the lsquoexiledrsquo Highlanders in Glasgow and Greenock, and she was present at number of gatherings there. She ed frequently to Skye, finally settling there in . During her time in the Lowlands she had become deeply involved in the Land Agitation movement and she continued to attend meetings in the islands and on the mainland. She also accompanied Charles Fraser Mackintosh on several trips on behalf of the movement. Mairi vigorously opposed the treatment and disenfranchisement of Skye crofters and wrote songs directed at those she held responsible and the indference of those unwilling to act. David Hume: philosopherDavid Hume was a Scottish philosopher, historian and essayist known for his radical philosophical scepticism and empiricism. He believed that passion rather than reason governed human behaviour and that human knowledge was solely based on human experience. Hume was born on February , , in Edinburgh. His father died when he was an infant, leaving him and his two older siblings in the care of his mother. Hume went with his older brother to the University of Edinburgh in .He began his literary journey with his masterpiece, A Treatise of Human Nature while he was living in France for three years. Though the book was widely discarded and written off by the critics then, it is today considered as one of the post important works on the history of Western philosophy. Hume found success only later in his le when he turned into an essayist. His job as a librarian in the University of Edinburgh helped him access a lot of research materials which provided him the guided information for his massive six volume masterpiece, lsquoThe History of Englandrsquo. The book earned favourable response and became a bestseller. It was considered as a standard history of England during its time. Charles Rennie Mackintosh Designer and architectThe Glasgow-born artist and architect attended evening classes at Glasgow School of Art while working as an apprentice to architect John Hutchison. It was through the School of Art that in  he gained his first commission as a professional, and won a prize from the Glasgow Institute of Fine Art, for a design for a terraced house. Between  and  most of the classic buildings associated with Mackintosh emerged. The Glasgow Herald Building was completed in  Ruchill Free Church Halls were completed in  Queens Cross Church opened for worship in  Kate Cranstonrsquos Willow Tearooms opened in  Hill House in Helensburgh was completed in late  The Glasgow School of Art was completed in stages between  and  The Scotland Street School was completed in  and The House for an Art Lover was designed in , though it was not built until the s.Mackintoshrsquos attention to detail was fanatical: in the Scotland Street School, for example, hot water pipes were routed below the coathooks, meaning that pupilrsquos coats were warm and dry at the end of the day. But this attention to detail, which some have attributed to borderline autism on Mackintoshrsquos part, also meant that the projects he led were seldomever profitable. Never as successful or as recognised in his day as he should have been, he has since gone on to become an hugely influential icon, a superstar of the design world. David Livingstone: Missionary and explorerLivingstone became a great hero of the Victorian era for his epic discoveries in the heart of unexplored Africa. He spent the last six years of his le almost cut off from the outside world, refusing to leave his beloved Africa. From an early age, he was fascinated with geology, science and the natural world. He had to work long hours in a local cotton mill from the age of  to . His work in the mills imbued him with a classic Protestant work ethic this experience left him with respect and empathy for workers. Fanny Wright: Feminist and social reformerFrances Wright was one of three children born in Dundee to Camilla Campbell and James Wright, a wealthy linen manufacturer and political radical. Both of her parents died young, and Fannywas orphaned at the age of three, but left with a substantial inheritance. An aunt acted asfor both Fanny and her sister Camilla. Wright was brought up in the homes of relatives, including James Milne, a member of the Scottish school of progressive philosophers. Milne, who encouraged Fanny to question conventional ideas, was to have a lasting influence on her development.She was to go on to tour the US extensively and was appalled by the practice of slavery. She decided to establish a colony in which slaves could be emancipated. She believed that slaves would work harder for their freedom than they would for a master, and therefore expected the colony to be self-supporting and to provide funds for the purchase and training of additional slaves. Due to the effect hard labour at the settlement took on her health, she went abroad to recover. She was later forced to abandon her plan, after spending her personal fortune on it.In the late s Wright was the first woman lecturer to speak publicly before gatherings of men and women in the United States about political and social-reform issues. She advocated for universal education, the emancipation of slaves, birth control, equal rights, sexual freedom, legal rights for married women, and liberal orce laws. Wright was also vocal in her opposition to organised religion and capital punishment. Sir Walter Scott: WriterFrom his earliest years, Scott was fond of listening to his elderly relativesrsquo accounts and stories of the Scottish Borders, and he soon became a voracious reader of poetry, history, drama, and fairy tales and romances. In  he published his first literary work, Minstrelsy of the Scottish Borders. It was his second work which made his name, however The Lay of the Last Minstrelwas an immensely successful poem. Scott followed this with further romantic poems, such as Marmionand The Lady in the Lake .In the decade between  and  Walter Scott published a succession of hugely popular historical novels, beginning with Waverley , Guy Mannering , and Ivanhoe . These books, and others that followed in the s, were published anonymously or under pseudonyms. It was not until  that the author was revealed to be Sir Walter Scott. He helped popularise the historic novel as a literary genre, and influenced generations of future writers. Robert Louis Stevenson: NovelistFrom a very early age, RLS was spinning stories. As a child ndash he was born in Edinburgh in November   ndash he suffered from chronic bronchial disease, and spent much of his childhood alone in bed making up tales. Trained first as an engineer and then as a lawyer, he was always more interested in writing, imitating authors he admired and then, from , publishing essays and working on plays.Conflicted with his father over both religion and earning a living, he led a bohemian le in Edinburgh and took walking tours in Britain and abroad.In , he met the love of his le, the lively American Fanny Van de Grt Osbourne. In , he followed her to Calornia, where they married after Fannyrsquos orce The Silverado Squattersis the story of their honeymoon in an abandoned mining camp. Stevensonrsquos fame grew with the publication of Treasure Island , and in  he and Fanny moved to Bournemouth, where they lived for three years. During this period he wrote Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Kidnapped . He died from a brain haemorrhage working on his very Scottish masterpiece The Weir of Hermiston. Thomas Telford: Godfather of civil engineeringThomas Telford was born near Westerkirk, Dumfries, in , the son of a poor shepherd. He apprenticed for a time to a stonemason in Langholm, and worked on the construction of Edinburghrsquos Newtown, before moving to London in  in search of work. There he helped design and build Somerset House, and later moved to Portsmouth as manager of works at the dockyards. He was responsible for the construction of the Ellesmere Canal in , and the Severn Suspension Bridge at Montford .His success led to a government appointment to survey the roads in rural Scotland as part of a major transportation improvement scheme. His survey results were accepted and Telford was asked to oversee the construction of some , miles of roads and  bridges ndash a job which took him over  years to complete. Also in Scotland, Telford worked on dock improvements in Wick, Aberdeen, Peterhead, Leith, and Banff, as well as the Caledonian Canal project linking a series of freshwater lochs with  miles of canals. His use of the cast iron arch bridge at Craigellachie in Strathspey and the Waterloo Bridge in Wales turned structure into a form of art. In  Telford helped found the Institute of Civil Engineers, and he served as its first president. Alex Salmond:One of the most signicant political figures of recent historyIt is dficult to exaggerate the importance of Alex Salmond to the Scottish National Party. He was responsible not just for hauling the SNP from the fringes of Scottish politics to become a party of government, but also for forming a majority SNP administration at Holyrood and holding a referendum on Scottish independence. Alexander Elliott Anderson Salmond joined the SNP in , while still a teenager. He went on to become a rising star of the party, winning the Westminster seat of Banff and Buchan in  ndash and notably getting himself banned from the Commons chamber for a week after interrupting the chancellorrsquos Budget speech in protest at the introduction of the poll tax in Scotland. When the SNP leadership job came up in , Salmond grabbed the opportunity and repositioned the party as more pro-European. He resigned in , for reasons which remain largely unexplained, but came back again as leader in , to mould his party as a more focused force.Confronted with a combative ndash some might say brash ndash SNP leader, Scottish Labour imploded, losing a series of leaders, and found itself out of power in Westminster too. Following his leadership comeback, on a joint ticket with deputy Nicola Sturgeon, Salmond led the SNP to what was then its greatest hour ndash victory at the  Scottish election and delivery of a minority SNP government. He went on to lead the party to a landslide victory in . The nationalistsrsquo victory brought about a generational sht in Scotland, where Labour had been the dominant force.The result made the independence referendum a certainty and the first minister, along with his government and the wider independence movement, set out a vision of Scotlandrsquos as one of the worldrsquos richest small nations ndash with opponents arguing he was willing to say anything to win a ldquoYes vote. But on the night it wasnrsquot to be, as voters rejected independence by % to % on September  . Salmond stood down as First Minister and SNP leader the next day. He faces nine charges of sexual assault and two of attempted rape, which he denies.Tomorrow: The top  Scots"},{"url":null,"title":"fidelma-cook-post-brexit-fairytale","story":"My heart sank.

First we need to give councils the power of consent when someone proposes changing a home to a holiday home, and also we need to allow social home providers, community organisations and local authorities to purchase land at closer to the original value.ldquoWhen land is sold with planning permission or the perception that it will be used for housebuilding then you can add pound, on to the asking price, even for rough arable land.He added: ldquoSelling it for what it is actually worth, not to private builders but to councils and social housing providers, would allow more house to be built as budgets could be stretched further.Faisal Faisal Choudhry, director of Scottish Research and Residential Research at estate agents Savills, said that house price growth had not been as big a barrier to purchasing a home in rural areas as it has in the cities.Instead, the problem has been supply for the housing market and the number of new homes being built.He said: ldquoThe lack of houses in rural areas and the dficulty people experience purchasing a property is not because of house price growth, but because of a lack of choice.ldquoIf no new supply is coming on to the market then people are forced to stay renting or living with parents, and thatrsquos eventually not sustainable for young couples looking for their first home.He said that the amount of social housing being built had gone some way to alleviating the problem, but it still left people waiting months, or even years, to get the keys to their own home.Mr Choudhry said: ldquoWith social housing you have to be qualied to get on to the councilrsquos list, and it is means tested. And people can be waiting years in some cases.ldquoThey end up looking at areas where there are homes coming onto the market, such as Renfrewshire, West Dunbartonshire and the Lothians, and move there.ldquoBut these places arenrsquot rural. People are faced with a choice: stay in the hope that something comes up, or up sticks and go to where the houses are.Three years ago, the Scottish government launched two projects, thepound million Rural Housing Fund and the poundm Islands Housing Fund, to provide grants and loans to groups building homes in areas where there is pressure on the housing market.According to the latest statistics from July, it has helped fund almost  homes, including new dwellings in Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney, the Highlands and Kinross.Minister for Local Government, Housing and Planning, Kevin Stewart, said: ldquoWe remain on track to deliver at least , affordable homes by , including , for social rent, backed by record investment of more thanpound. billion. Our most recent official statistics show we have delivered more than , affordable homes since .ldquoThe poundm Rural and Islands Housing Funds were launched as part of wider housing policy to increase supply of long term affordable housing in rural areas.ldquoGiven the complex nature of rural housing projects, we extended the timescales for these funds from the initial three years to five to allowas many projects as possible to come forward.ldquoWe are also working to ensure those who aspire to home ownership are able to achieve it and over , households have been supported through our home ownership schemes since ."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8717854.jpg?type=article-full","title":"parliament-suspension-sought-clandestine-manner-says-lord-carloway","story":"Boris Johnsons decision to suspend Parliament was ruled \"improper\" and \"unlawful by threejudges, chaired by Lord Carloway, Scotlandrsquos most senior judge, who overturned anearlier rulingthat the courts did not have the power to interfere in the prime ministerrsquos political decision toprorogue parliament.The judges feltit had been done with \"the purpose of stymying Parliament\".The full opinions from the judges at the Court of Session in Edinburgh - who said the prorogation was \"null and of no effect\" - have now been issued.The Court of Session case, brought by a group of more than  parliamentarians, appealed against an earlier ruling by a judge that the Prime Ministers prorogation was lawful.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Suspension of Parliament ruled  uimproper u and  uunlawful u by Scottish court\",\"description\": \"Suspension of Parliament ruled  uimproper u and  uunlawful u by Scottish court\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media etWZis poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests etWZis.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Judge Lord Doherty dismissed the challenge at the Court of Session last Wednesday, saying it was for politicians and not the courts to decide.But the three judges at the Inner House, the supreme civil court in Scotland, disagreed with Lord Dohertys ruling on Wednesday.:Ian McConnell: BMW talks reality as Johnson camp veil slips to reveal truth of BrexitIn the full opinions released on Thursday,Lord Carloway,the most senior judge of theSupreme Courts of Scotlandand head of the Scottish Judiciary,said: \"The circumstances demonstrate that the true reason for the prorogation is to reduce the time available for Parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit at a time when such scrutiny would appear to be a matter of considerable importance, given the issues at stake.\"This is in the context of an anticipated no-deal Brexit, in which case no further consideration of matters by Parliament is required. The Article  period, as extended, will have expired and withdrawal will occur automatically.\"The Lord President of the Court of Session said this conclusion on the \"true reason\" stemmed from a number of factors.\"First, the prorogation was sought in a clandestine manner during a period in which litigation concerning the prospect of prorogation occurring was extant,\" he said.:Judges ruleParliament suspensionis unlawful\"Although it is possible to argue about exactly what was meant by the respondents fth plea-in-law, it is not unreasonable to comment that even the respondents legal team appear to have been kept in the dark about what was about to happen.\"Secondly, the decision to prorogue in the manner sought was taken against the background of the discussions in which it was being suggested that MPs, and thus Parliament, would be unable to prevent a no-deal Brexittime was simply allowed to elapse, without further legislation, until the exit date.\"Put shortly, prorogation was being mooted specically as a means to stymie any further legislation regulating Brexit.\"Thirdly, there is remarkably little said about the reason for the prorogation in the respondents pleadings.\"Lord Drummond Young said in court documentscan be said to provide any rational explanation as to why Parliament must be prorogued as early as September  for a period of five weeks.\"Nor has any other explanation been provided for theof the prorogation, beyond references to the need to begin a new session of Parliament to promote a new legislative programme,\" he said.\"That, of course, does not explain theof the prorogation merely the fact that prorogation is required.\"In these circumstances I have come to the conclusion that the only inference that can properly be drawn on an objective basis is that the Government, and the Prime Minister in particular, wished to restrict debate in Parliament for as long as possible during the period leading up to the European Council meeting on   October and the scheduled date of Britains departure from the European Union.\"It would be wrong to speculate as to whether this is because the Government wishes to persuade the European Union to accept a withdrawal agreement that dfers from the agreement previously concluded or whether the Government is truly intent on achieving departure from the European Union without a withdrawal agreement.\"In either event, the matter clearly calls for Parliamentary scrutiny.

They virtually accused a sitting Prime Minister of lying to his Queen as a means of escaping the scrutiny of the sovereign parliament he is sworn to uphold and from whom he derives his power. This bore all the imprints of a political coup now we know it actually was one. If they can do thisthey can even contemplate doing this then all the other democratic institutions that underpin the way we reach decisions and make choices must be considered fair game too.When left-wing revolutions have occurred where in the world radicals try to justy them, even when they have withered under human corruption. ldquoAt least they were attempted for the benefit of the many, they say. But what lies in store when a revolution is staged by the few who also control our security services  There is a reason why social mobility is scarcer at the top of the UK military than in any other of the UKrsquos social and cultural jurisdictions.The conduct of Brexit, deal or no deal, has permitted the SNP to claim the social and cultural arguments. Their politicians at Westminster, led by the formidable duo of Joanna Cherry and Ian Blackford, have been the driving forces of the anti-Brexit alliance and have provided it with moral purpose. This is symbolic of another rather more perverse irony: that the hallowed institutions of UK identity and pride will be respected and upheld more in an independent Scotland than in a UK ruled by the Johnson Cummings Rees-Mogg axis. Evena deal of sorts is concluded in the next four weeks this remains the most likely outcome of the next General Election.:Paul Hutcheon: the Queen will see off independence, but will her son In Scotland, the ability of the Unionist parties to oppose independence has also diminished. Ruth Davidson, their most eloquent advocate has retired because she too couldnrsquot trust her boss. The Scots Tory MPs who arrived at Westminster on her coat-tails have since been exposed as indolent popinjays of a stamp much more reactionary and right-wing than their Holyrood counterparts, and thatrsquos saying something. Five years ago, too, it seemed that the Labour Party in Scotland had dredged the lowest depths after its leadership turned it into a footstool of the UK Conservatives. Somehow they have since found a lower place and have learned nothing.The sight this week of Anas Sarwar sharing a  with Gordon Brown was wretchedly appropriate. One of these men destroyed himself in an unhealthy obsession with being Prime Minister the other has lately become obsessive about leading Labour in Scotland. To proclaim a message of Hope Not Hate when attacking the Yes movement is cheap, nasty and unworthy of either. Itrsquos a sign of desperation and of itself proof that neither is ndash or ever was ndash cut out for mature leadership. They know and we know that you only need to worry about nationalist movements when they are being proclaimed in countries that are already independent.If independence is delivered, and we are closer to it right now than we ever were at any time during the first referendum, then it will have been gted by a British elite which was unable to camouflage its true nature. Thus, the biggest threat to independence may yet come from within the SNP itself. The cybernats who have been made convenient scapegoatsfor the ills of political discourse are nothing of the sort. Instead itrsquos a toxic troupe of silent assassins which have taken root inside the SNP, under the influence of the Scottish Greens, who could damage the Yes movement. They have previously tried to destroy the careers of Joanna Cherry and Joan McAlpine, two of the SNPrsquos most able operators. Now they are attempting to create a hostile environment for those whose religious beliefs they donrsquot seem able to tolerate. The SNP leadership must isolate this faction before they cause greater damage when it really matters."},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-political-diary","story":"PHILIP Rycroft, former permanent secretary at the Department for Exiting the European Union, had them queueing out the door at Edinburgh Uni for a speech on Brexit and the Union this week.

Where are the constitutional lawyers who must know that this the issue  Parliament decides on policy after debates, readings, consultation in both Houses by people who have a reasonable chance of understanding the issues and only Parliament can finally decide government policy.Kenneth Roberts, Lenzie.Read more: Sturgeon under pressure at FMQs over hospitals crisis"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-scotland-force-good-world","story":"While the Scottish First Minister said the last  years had been defined by the Conservatives austerity agenda and the pursuit of Brexit, the next period should be about \"what Scotland can do for the world\".Ms Sturgeon, who was addressing business leaders in Glasgow, argued that in recent years the policies of \"the most reckless, self-interested UK government in living memory\" had hindered efforts to make Scotland a fairer and more prosperous nation.Speaking at the Business for Scotland dinner, she said: \"We are reaching the end of a decade which will be remembered for two Tory obsessions - austerity and Brexit.\"Both of these have been an unmitigated disaster - not just for Scotland, but for the whole of the UK.: Boris Johnson is a serial liar who doesnt recognise the truth anymore\"The ideologically driven cuts to Scotlands budget have choked off the economic recovery and put incredible pressure on our public services.\"And the Brexit referendum, which was cynically designed to heal isions in the Tory party, has instead brought the UK to its knees.\"She hit out at Prime Minister Boris Johnson over his decision to suspend Parliament in the run-up to the UKs exit from the European Union on October  - saying that he \"appears to have misled the Queen, misled Parliament and misled the country\".Noting that Scotland had voted to stay part of the EU in the  referendum, Ms Sturgeon said: \"We didnt vote for Brexit, we didnt vote for Boris Johnson, and we certainly didnt vote for the catastrophic no-deal Brexit which is now being imposed on us. \"The SNP leader added: \"As we reach the end of this decade, lets all resolve that the next one will not be defined by that which is done to Scotland.: Scotland is closer to independence than it ever was in , says Kevin McKenna\"Instead, lets resolve that the next decade should be defined by what Scotland can do for the world.\"Lets resolve to use Scotlands immense human and natural resources to build a fairer and more prosperous nation - an economic powerhouse which is a force for good both at home and abroad.\""},{"url":null,"title":"call for shops to close on new year s day","story":"The shopworkers# trade union is urging all MSPs to back a motion calling for the closure of large shops in New Year#s Day.A survey of Scottish retail staff by the union Usdaw shows overwhelming support for the closure of stores on January .And the union is now calling on all MSPs to support the motion tabled by Jackie Baillie MSP in the Scottish Parliament seeking to ensure shop workers can enjoy some time off at New Year.The survey of more than  shop workers revealed:•  per cent believed stores should close on New Year’s Day, with  per cent saying they should also close on January .• Three quarters feel they spend too little time with friends and family over New Year.•  per cent have come under pressure to work on New Year’s Day or January .• Four in ten don’t receive any premium pay for working on New Year’s Day.•  per cent are not happy to work on New Year’s Day or January .Stewart Forrest, Usdaw’s Scottish isional officer, said: “This survey clearly demonstrates the strength feeling among our members. “We have written to all MSPs asking them to support Jackie Baillie’s motion calling for a decent break at New Year after the busy Christmas period.“I have also written to the Scottish Retail Consortium urging them to reconsider their opposition to large stores closing on New Year’s Day.”Mr Forrest stressed the union was fully supportive of efforts to revitalise our high streets as the livelihoods of its members depended on a thriving retail sector.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.carricktoday webimage ..!

Last year, , Scottish volunteers took part, removing an incredible , inidual items of litter at  beach cleans along , metres of Scottish coastline.Data collected by volunteers from over  years of MCS-led Great British Beach Cleans has been instrumental in the introduction of Scotland’s p single-use carrier bag charge, commitments to implement a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds and to introduce a depositscheme for bottles and cans.Mr McArthur will be joining the citizen science project to help clear and survey the litter found on Echna Loch Bay, Burray on Monday, September .“Orkney has a fine tradition when it comes to ‘bag the bruck’,# says Mr McArthur.#I have been involved in such clean up efforts since I was at school in Sanday.“Of course, these days there is a greater public awareness of marine litter, and concern about the problems caused by plastic pollution in our seas.“I’m looking forward to joining volunteers of all ages at Echna Loch Bay to support the Great British Beach Clean campaign. This will be just one of many such clean ups taking place across the country. As well as helping tidy up our beaches and coastlines, I hope the initiative helps highlight the importance of reducing waste and protecting our precious marine environment”.Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer said: “It’s fantastic to see that local MSP, Liam McArthur, will be joining us at Echna Loch Bay to support our Great British Beach Clean it’s really important for decision-makers to see how much litter, especially plastic, makes its way on to our beaches. We hope that Liam’s attendance at the Great British Beach Clean will encourage local constituents to join us for an eye-opening day on the beaches of Orkney. It#s vital that we all continue to work together to stop the tide of plastic in our oceans.”Constituents looking to join Liam McArthur at the Great British Beach Clean can sign up to volunteer at: www.mcsuk.org greatbritishbeachcleancopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He moved to Mexico City to begin his residency, which he soon left to support his political convictions and he eventually became the top commander in Fidel Castro’s revolutionary army.Professor Verghese will discuss the motivations of Guea and others, and the idea that their involvement in revolutions was an ethical consequence of their commitment to the wellbeing of patients and society. But by taking part in revolution, these doctors were often at odds with the medical establishment, their profession, and even the state. These conflicts will be discussed during the lecture. Professor Verghese has himself lived through a military coup. He was born in Ethiopia, where his education was interrupted during civil unrest as the emperor was deposed by a Marxist military government. He later moved to America with his family, where later became professor for the theory and practice of medicine at Stanford University Medical School and senior associate chair of the department of internal medicine.His first book, My Own Country, a memoir about treating Aids in rural Tennessee, was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award for  and was made into a movie.In , President Barack Obama honoured Professor Verghese with the National Humanities Medal.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

In truth, the margin of defeat flattered St John’s who, for the second game running, failed to fire.They got out of jail at the weekend when an injury-time Pearse Donnelly goal almost plundered an unlikely victory before Conal Delargy kicked the equaliser. The general consensus was that Casements had missed the boat and that the Johnnies would win the replay, but Portglenone boss Barry Dillon said he knew his players could better Sunday’s performance. “We sat back too deep on Sunday, it was our own fault,” said Dillon. “Maybe the fear of winning made them a bit apprehensive, but we knew we had more in us. “In the first half of the drawn game, we showed we are the better team and we had that belief coming into this game that we could go and finish it.” While Portglenone fielded an unchanged team from Sunday’s drawn game, St John’s started Domhnall Nugent, Brian ‘Bam’ Neeson and Sunday’s goal-scorer Donnelly. Yet, as was the case on Sunday, it was Casements who made the brighter start with a hat-trick of frees from Conal Delargy and Ronan Kellyhelping them establish a - to no score lead after a cagey opening  minutes. It took the Johnnies  minutes to open their account following a well-worked move finished by Matthew Fitzpatrick, but Paddy Kelly responded in kind for Portglenone minutes later. Peter McCallin got his side’s second score on  minutes with St John’s struggling to break down a well-organised Portglenone defence. The Whiterock Road men then lost Donnelly to a black card and Delargy converted another free to move his side - to - ahead. When Kieron McKenna added another from play, Portglenone looked in a strong position approaching half-time and a Paddy McBride free with the last kick of the half was badly needed by the under-par West Belfast outfit. The second half was just four minutes old when Portglenone cut a dash through the heart of the St John’s defence to score a brilliant goal with full-forward Michael Donnelly firing past Padraig Nugent. Less than a minute later, St John’s hit back with a goal of their own. Having been off-target with a few efforts from frees,Neeson’s fortunes changed when an attempt at a point dipped under the crossbar and beyond the reach of Portglenone goalkeeper Ryan O’Neill. That should have been the catalyst for St John’s to kick on, but instead it was Portglenone who regained control of proceedings as another Delargy score moved them four clear once more. St John’s continued to squander chances at the other end with Neesonand Fitzpatrick firing wide of the posts. McBride converted a free before Dermot McAleese broke forward to score for Casements. Ryan McNulty landed a stunning point from play with  minutes of normal time remaining, yet their hopes of another rousing comeback were dented when they lost centre-forward Conal Kelly to a second booking. McBride briefly reduced the gap to two points while Nugent was forced to make a great save to deny Niall McKeever at the other end. Michael Kelly scored an excellent point moments after his introduction for Portglenone and a Ronan Kelly free gave them a four-point cushion approaching full-time. Rather than sit back and defend their lead as they did last Sunday, Dillon’s men went for the jugular and further points from McKeever and midfielder Fergal O’Kane put them six clear. There was one last surge from St John’s with Michael Bradley’s sideline being fisted into the net by Fitzpatrick deep into stoppage time and the Antrim star had a second goal-bound shot blocked with the final play of the game. Yet Portglenone were the better team over the two games and they progress to a semi-final meeting with Lámh Dhearg on Saturday, September  at Creggan.

For Martin Moreland, Principal of Mercy College, it was very dferent indeed.Born on the Ormeau Road in South Belfast, Martin was the youngest of six children. Having left school with no exams, Martin’s road to the classroom and education sector began as an engineer.“I never really thought I would be a teacher because I never had the confidence to be one,” he explained.“It was a dream in a sense but I never really thought it would be a reality.“I left secondary school with no exams. I went out into the world of work – it gives you a lot of le experiences or the real world as I call it.“I went into engineering and had several jobs. My we has a job in education and she told me about a course up in Derry that gave you access into university. I went and got a GCSE in English and Maths and spent three years up in Derry doing the course.Martin was accepted into St Mary’s University College and after his first teaching job in West Belfast, has moved to the North of the city.“With my engineering background, my first job was a Technology and Design teacher in St Colm’s in Twinbrook and I spent  years there. I loved it there, it was a great community and a school that was thriving.“I moved on to Mercy where there was just  kids. I started off as a teacher before becoming Principal and I’ve been in the role for ten years.”Martin then reflected on the many changes in education over the years, not least the challenges and successes of Mercy College.“When I came in, it was about building up confidence and profile of the school, given our location in North Belfast.“Pupil numbers now are  but our challenges now is very much to do with space and classrooms.“We have been co-educational for a few years now which is fantastic. We have a   ratio girls and boys in Year . Our LLS programme is still really successful and we were the first school to start that.“The standards are amazing – % of girls are getting three A-Levels from A* to C which is very unique. % of our GCSE students got five GCSE’s at the top grades and there are not many other schools in the North that can boast such results.“Finances remain a huge challenge for us. There is no room for any extra money in the system. It is not easy at all.”Away from school, Martin is kept a busy man being a father of ten children.“I am a family man. I am a father-of-ten so at home it is a very busy household, with the kids ranging from  to .“I am very much an outdoor person. I like nature and sunshine. I am also big into running and gardening.

There are other guys in Derry who are on the edge of that, the problem with this is and Declan Morgan was right, there is a human cost, a psychological cost, a physical cost.“People are getting their hopes built up thinking something is going to happen and then they’re deflated again, you can only pull yourself up so many times.“I’m having dficulty pulling myself up week by week, to continue fighting this, and it would be a hell of a lot more dficult for people who aren’t aware of the detail and the argument that goes into getting this far.”For victims it is about much more than monetary compensation, that comes secondary to an apology from the state and institutions responsible and a package that enables them to move on with their lives in a better way – which includes appropriate healthcare and support.Last Friday, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland Sir Declan Morgan said it was \"shocking\" that victims are still awaiting action.He revealed that before Sir Anthony Harte, who chaired the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry, died, he had expressed \"profound disappointment\" at the lack of progress.Sir Declan said it \"epitomises how the lack of an assembly impacts negatively on the lives of Northern Irelands citizens\".‘Absolute disgrace’The Historical Institutional Abuse Redress Bill was listed amongst parliament business on Monday but was not dealt with because of prorogation.Mr McCourt believes the suspension of parliament by Prime Minister Boris Johnson has essentially “killed off” the Redress Bill.“To all intents and purposes the Redress Bill is killed off. If the legislation is not passed and hasn’t gone through the House of Lords and received the royal seal of approval then it is killed off.“The fact that it hasn’t been dealt with at this stage is an absolute disgrace, Declan Morgan is right to bring it back up again.“Even at this point they are still talking about it being a devolved matter, the hope of having this dealt with through the NI Assembly does not exist, the only avenue for this to go forward is through Westminster.\"Speaking at Westminster on Tuesday, Independent Unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon said she was \"extremely annoyed and disgusted\" that the motion to discuss historical abuse in NI wasnt even moved because of prorogation.\"By proroguing parliament tonight, the Prime Minister has wilfully and deliberately deprived victims of a -minute debate. He has sent out a clear signal that those victims to not even merit a debate.“It’s appalling, I ask the Secretary of State to demand that the Prime Minister comes to NI, sits at the meeting and looks the victims of HIA in the face and explains to them why he is so disrespectful and discourteous of the hurt and the suffering that they have had to endure.”Unexpected and emergency debates were to blame, Julian Smith explained, and he apologised for the change in business which he said “in no way diminishes how seriously I’m progressing the issues or affected the commitments I have made.”Mr Smith said officials have prepared the policy and lawyers the draft law and he has asked that it be included in the Queen’s speech as a matter of urgent priority.He was however challenged about why legislation hasn’t been brought forward and was told that the state is failing victims yet again.Scotland’s progressIn Scotland their inquiry is ongoing, the report is not written, but the Scottish First Minister has instructed the civil service to initiate an advanced payment scheme. Anyone over  years of age or with a terminal illness can now apply for an award of £, – which is not their full and final settlement.Some child migrants who were taken from homes in Northern Ireland and shipped off to Australia have also received payments.Mr McCourt believes the same could have been done for victims in Northern Irelandthere had been the political will to do it.The HIA inquiry studied allegations of abuse in  homes and other residential institutions between  to .These were run by the state, local authorities, the Catholic Church, the Church of Ireland and the children’s charity Barnardo’s. The largest number of complaints related to four Catholic-run homes.A report in  recommended that victims should receive compensation, however, the process of securing compensation stalled when devolution collapsed in the same week.After a four-year Inquiry and over two and a half years since the publication of the report, the government has still failed to deliver a promised apology and financial redress.In recent weeks Secretary of State for NI, Julian Smith, gave assurances to victims that a Redress Bill would be fast-tracked through Westminster. But Brexit, and the suspension of parliament, has placed yet another roadblock in front of victims.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Termonbacca where historical institutional abuse took place.  Campaigner Jon McCourt has highlighted that another HIA victim has passed away before receiving compensation."},{"url":null,"title":"key city deal innovation projects outlined derry strabane council","story":"A number of innovative projects are being developed by Ulster University which will be funded as part of the Derry City Deal.In a detailed report laid out by the Council’s Chief Executive, John Kelpie, and experts from Ulster University , local councillors were told that signicant progress had been made in terms of the scaling and prioritisation of projects since the initial City Deal funding announcement in May.In relation to strategic projects included in the City Deal, the core focus of the UK Government £M City Deal funding remains the delivery of the centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationtogether with the key smart digital City and Region initiatives.At the meeting, representatives from Ulster University said that Outline Business Cases in respect of these priority projects are currently being further developed in line with Government funding guidelines.The word “transformational” was used numerous times by the  of experts from Ulster University.It was explained to councillors how the Cognitive Analytics Research Lab or CARL is a new cutting-edge Applied Research Centre from Ulster University will bring together businesses, government and Articial Intelligence expertise with academia.It will consolidate the expertise that already exists at the University and complement it with new resources to create a centre that is world leading in research and dedicated specically to cognitive analytics.The CARL innovation centre would provide the city with global opportunities to become world class in areas such as software engineering, advanced networks and sensors, data analytics and cyber security and would offer huge potential to the city and wider region’s economic development.Referring to the Centre for Industrial Digitalisation, Robotics and Automationinnovation project, councillors were told how the proposed innovation centre will support industry and commerce in Northern Ireland based at the Magee campus in the exploitation of industrial digital technologies, robotics and automation.Members were also informed that the overall aim of the CIDRA project is to future proof NI industry and provide pathways towards the development of innovative products and allow existing companies to increase their productivity.The importance of CIDRA in providing industrial and commercial support to businesses across Northern Ireland was highlighted to members who were informed that the innovation centre will focus on research, development and demonstration of the five key technologies – articial technologies, robotics, automation, the internet of things and industrial digital technologies – that are essential for future industrialisation.Once developed the centre will provide state of the art demonstrator facilities in robotics, automation and become a leader in pursuing international led research in the application of articial intelligence in industry and commerce. Members were told that a key element of this innovation project was the provision of mechanism to support the transfer of skills and expertise to company staff and university students.Personalised MedicineIn relation to the prioritisation of the Future Fund of £m and the further anticipated match funding from NI Government and other partners, the emphasis is on advancing with projects such as the Graduate Medical School as a key catalyst for the much-needed expansion of the Ulster University Magee Campus. The delivery of a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellenceat Ulster University and Altnagelvin is also a priority for this fund as is the provision of an integrated, Council-wide, multi-skills employment pathways intervention support programme.The report advised that work on these innovation projects as well as the proposed SMART and digital city projects were advancing in close collaboration with local industry and partners and relevant government departments, while the strategic outline cases for major regeneration projects for Derry City and Strabane Town Centre are at an advanced stage of progress.The Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence intends on harnessing the power of Genomics to predict and diagnose inherited and acquired disease, and to personalise treatments and interventions.The Ulster University representatives said it will expand its partnership with Genomics Ireland and other commercial enterprises to sequence the genomes of % of NI’s population contributing to a research database that can be interrogated to develop personalised medicine solutions with worldwide application and valuable I.P. and how it will also contribute to health improvement locally through a unique ‘community buy-in’ approach.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":"https://img.resized.co/derrynow/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3MzLWV1LXdlc3QtMS5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3N0b3JhZ2UucHVibGlzaGVycGx1cy5pZVxcXC9tZWRpYS5yaXZlcm1lZGlhLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAxOVxcXC8wOVxcXC8wOTEyMTkwNlxcXC9TVFJBQkFORS1ERVZJQ0UtLnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo2NDcsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjozNDAsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2NhY2hlLnJlc2l6ZWQuY29cXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhlOTFmNGZjY2ExNDE2YjZiOGFkN2MwMzExOGY0ZWQ0NThmOWJlMmIifQ==/strabane-device.png","title":"security operation creggan area derry following discovery mortar device strabane","story":"District Commander Superintendent Gordon McCalmont said: \"It is our assessment that the New IRA is responsible for the mortar device that was discovered outside homes in Church View Close in Strabane on Saturday morning th September. The people who left this device had every intention of killing my colleagues serving the Strabane community. They showed no regard for the families, elderly and vulnerable people who were forced to leave their homes and whose lives were put at risk.   As a parent myself it was terrying to hear local mother Aileen Mullan recount how close her children were to this deadly device.\"The New IRA members behind this attack are living in the community. They are building bombs and storing weapons and placing the community at risk. To further highlight the recklessness and total disregard shown by the New IRA,  a public safety operation is taking place in Creggan this morning th September involving approximately  officers and explosive detection dogs. Our assessment is that this group is concealing bomb making materials. We have a number of areas of focus but there is nothing definitive and no guarantees. However, our chances of success are vastly improved by support and information from the community.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot

For example, can lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights in the town centre  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking Cllr Curran said he believes that all the key players need to get together, suggesting years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors to the town.He added: ldquoIt is time to forensically examine the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward.

It was also an effective way to promote the work that we do and raise awareness among the regular customers to Asda. ldquoThe foodbank has noticed an increase in donations to our permanent collection point in the store since the campaign ands partnerships like this make our work so much more effective.Downpatrick store manager, Roger Croskery, said Asda has always always been proud to support the communities it serves.ldquoOur community champions work tirelessly to support charities, projects and initiatives that make a real dference to the people living around their Asda shop, he said.ldquoBut we want to do even more to help local communities across the UK to save money so they can live better. Wersquoll do this is by doing our part to tackle the growing issue of poverty in the UK and our Fight Hunger campaign is part of this work.Roger and Linda, along withy other staff members from the Downpatrick store, recently visited the Fountain Foodbank to see the impact the donations have made, to meet volunteers and find out more about how the foodbank works.The foodbank provides emergency food parcels to those who find themselves in dficult circumstances and has distributed over three thousand food parcels in the local area since opening in March .It also receives weekly donations of fresh food from Asda as part of an ongoing scheme with FareShare which has  yearsrsquo experience working with the food industry to safely ert edible surplus through a UK-wide network of frontline charities fighting food poverty.FareShare works with businesses and charities to get food to good causes in a way thatrsquos cost effective and makes sense for the business and the charities, with the Fountain Foodbank registered to receive some of this food.The volunteers say this particular initiative is an effective way to cut down on waste and help those who find themselves in dficult circumstances.Asda says that by the end of the Fight Hunger campaign, it aims to provide an additional  million meals every year by investing in the charitiesrsquo infrastructure and services so they can collect, store and transport more food.In addition, the store aims to provide , vulnerable people access to fresh food every year and make fresh food the norm in food banks and not the exception.Asda also wants to tackle the root causes of poverty, helping one million people with the food and support they need to help them out of the situation they are in and expand the companyrsquos existing food donation activities so every one of its stores has the ability to donate edible surplus food to local food banks and community groups..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C September 4%2C 1979  ","story":"WARRENPOINT mdash A plea by Official Unionists to adjourn this weekrsquos meeting of Down Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain.

It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables.

The proposed new school will also be in the trusteeship of the De La Salle Congregation.St Patrickrsquos Grammar has maintained its opposition to the merger proposal since it was muted in , while both De La Salle and St Maryrsquos support the merger.Mr Joe McCann, St Patrickrsquos Grammar principal, said he is ldquodisappointed that an apparent EA source had broken the news of the merger plan locally before his and the other schools were formally notied.St Patrickrsquos parent body mdash The Parents and Friends Associationmdash said that it will ldquovehemently fight these proposals with every means necessary, through the courts and, unfortunately, in the media.PFA spokesperson, Cormac Artt, criticised the EA on how the news was leaked ahead of the schools being notied last Thursday and the argument that local children will be educated together and the likelihood of capital funding for a single-site school build.Mr Artt continued: ldquoThis proposal cites an enrolment of  pupils and alleges that this yearly intake will be made up of up to % who will be admitted by academic selection.ldquoHowever, the census figures suggest thatall those who live within a three-mile radius and those for whom the school is the nearest Catholic grammar are admitted automatically without sitting the GL entrance assessment, there will be very few,any, places for those applicants seeking admission via academic selection.Mr Artt suggested that the outworking of this means that the rural communities and primary schools who have been an integral part of the grammar schoolrsquos -year history, will no longer have a place in this proposed super school, including those in Teconnaught, Loughinisland, Strangford, Kilclief, Dundrum, the Ards peninsula, Castlewellan and Newcastle.ldquoThe choice for boys in these areas who wish an academically selective education will therefore be travel to Newry or Belfast to try to secure a selective grammar school place in Catholic schools that are already heavily oversubscribed, he said.ldquoThe alternative for those who wish to keep the tradition and connection with Downpatrick will be to attend the state academically selective, Down High School. Aside from the injustice of this on the rural communities, is the impact this will have on families.While the EA said that the proposals have ldquoalready been subject to formal stakeholder consultation with parents, staff, governors and pupils, Mr Artt disputed that.ldquoParents of students from St Patrickrsquos Grammar requested a meeting with the De La Salle Trustees in April to discuss the Trusteesrsquo vision going forward. They finally responded in June by refusing to meet the parents citing rsquoit is not clear what,anything, will be gained by a meeting,rsquo which clearly makes the parents think that they do not care about the pupils of the school where they are Trustees.ldquoThe Board of Governors, staff and parents are overwhelmingly opposed to this proposal and for the De La Salle Trustees, who are the only stakeholder supporting this vision, to refuse to speak to the current parents is a disgrace.De La Salle principal, Ciaran Maguire, said he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He told the Recorder: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.ldquoThe De La Salle Congregation have been working on bringing post primary education in Downpatrick into the st century. In , they first proposed that St Patrickrsquos Grammar should become a co-educational school.ldquoThe Department of Education at the time wanted to see a proposal that was reflective and inclusive of all schools in the Downpatrick area. That advice was taken by the De La Salle congregation and they have been working, in partnership, on a solution to ensure that all children in the greater Downpatrick area have an education system that they can be proud of.Mr Maguire said the origin of the transfer test ldquowas a solution to a problem back then, suggesting the problem is dferent now and a new solution is needed.He added: ldquoWhat we need now for our children is something radical and exciting for all those involved. If we are the child-centred schools we say we are, then this is undeniably the right thing to do, not just for my pupils, but for the St Maryrsquos girls and St Patrickrsquos boys.Mr Maguire contended that while some may see the proposal as ldquoas an attempt to wipe out a schoolrsquos history and tradition, itrsquos an opportunity for them to continue their great work in preparing our children for le.He said that it will cater for all children from the local feeder schools, without the fear of having to sit and possibly fail a test.Mr Maguire added: ldquoWe are removing barriers those same barriers that our children currently struggle with, the fear and anxiety of not fitting in, not being good enough. I urge all parents to get behind this proposal, your opinion matters and should count.Welcoming the proposed merger, St Maryrsquos High School principal, Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, said ldquoit has the ability to deliver.She added: ldquoWe are very proud of our school as a centre of excellence and we look forward to this new opportunity of proposed change to serve all young people..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Migle.jpg","title":"Migle thanks foster parents for help in education success  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH woman has thanked her foster carers for the key role they played in her educational success.Miglehas revealed how growing up in foster care helped shape her future career as the Regional Adoption and Fostering Service launches a new campaign encouraging more people to become foster carers across the Provincersquos health trusts.Migle was fostered by South Eastern Trust foster carers Michael and Martha eight years ago and is currently studying Computer Science at Queenrsquos University Belfast.She moved in her with foster parents when she was  and admits she would not be where she is today without their support.ldquoBefore I went to live with Michael and Martha I never even thought about going to university, said Migle who moved to Northern Ireland in  from Lithuania.ldquoThey were able to help me choose what I wanted to do with my le.

Over the past three years Irish Lights has proactively engaged with the local community and relevant state agencies to establish the best approach to the site. he continued.ldquoWe have now developed and tested new technology to achieve a sustainable solution that will enable retention of the historic lens and sweeping beam at St. Johnrsquos Point. I look forward to meeting with the community to discuss these plans in more detail.The Lecale Lightkeepers say that while they accept there is some concession on CILrsquos part in proposing to keep the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, they have been informed by the Commissioner that the range of the beam will be reduced by up to nine miles. They also claim that the beamrsquos iconic ldquoloom will be lost, robbing the lighthouse of what they describe as its ldquointangible heritage.A spokesperson for campaigners said that through their freedom of information requests for communication between CIL and others, they have found a ldquolack of appreciation for the intangible heritage of lighthouses and a disregard of the views of coastal communities.ldquoWe have seen examples of modernised lights and none have retained their original characteristics. The new light source proposed for St Johnrsquos Point would be an LED which, in itself is suspect, as according to the Royal Society Publication April , LEDs have detrimental effects on Epaunal Marine Communities.Campaigners say Newry Mourne and Down Council has already voted unanimously to protect the sweeping beamrsquos current mechanism and trustsrsquos that CIL will not be given planning permission to proceed with its proposal.ldquoThe lighthouse is a listed building and its character, the light, must be protected, declared the campaignersrsquo spokesperson.ldquoWith the loss of the historic lights at Fastnet, Mew and Tory it is even more vital that St Johnrsquos Point should be kept for heritage purposes. Moreover, it is a beautul feature of our nocturnal landscape, much loved by the local communities.Turning to concerns about the mercury in the current lighthouse mechanism, the spokesperson said mercury vapour is a known toxic substance, arguing that vaporisation only occurs in certain circumstances, notably in very warm conditions where there is poor ventilation.ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is fully automated and the lantern room is well ventilated.ldquoAccording to the late attendant Henry Henvey, the mercury had not needed any attention in at least  years nor were there ever any concerns about its safety.Next Wednesday eveningrsquos meeting in Ardglass starts at pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th September 2019 Red.jpg","title":"Red High 25 group in fundraising drive  ","story":"NEARLY  years on, the loss of Ballynahinch teenager Mark Quinn is still keenly felt today mdash by his grieving family, schoolmates and his fellow soccer players.The  year-old took his own le on December , , with his funeral service one of the biggest his home town has ever seen.Earlier this year, Markrsquos former classmates at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School in Downpatrick joined together to fundraise in support of community mental health initiatives in his memory coming up to his anniversary.The former students, now grown men, many with sons of their own, all found that Markrsquos death hit them in dferent ways then and throughout the following years.The group, known as Red High , decided that they wanted to raise money to help support other young men who may feel in despair.Markrsquos family is fully behind the initiative and other planned events which will go to support Ballynahinch Counselling Services and The Edge Youth and Community Centre.The gesture comes with the knowledge that Ballynahinch has one of the highest suicide rates in the district.World Suicide Prevention Day was marked yesterday and Department of Health officials announced plans to reduce suicide rates in Northern Ireland by % over the next five years.Speaking of behalf of her parents, Peg, and the late Hugh Quinn, and siblings Lynda, Michael, John, Patrick, Jarlath, David and Jemma, Markrsquos sister Katie Cassidy said they were ldquooverwhelmed to have been contacted during the summer holidays by Markrsquos school friends from the Red High.Katie said: ldquoTheir effort to keep Markrsquos memory alive while also raising awareness about mental health issues is more relevant now than ever.

Talking can make all the dference, we wish we knew then what we know now.ldquoThe pain and devastating reality of living without your son, brother, nephew or uncle truly causes physical pain. But there is also help in dealing with the loss of someone to suicide. In the early days after Markrsquos death when our faith was extremely tested, we received tremendous support from our parish community.Katie also asked for support for the upcoming football tournament at St Patrickrsquos Grammar next Saturday, September  and for Ballynahinch Olympicrsquos annual fundraising effort.She said: ldquoWe hope everyone will come along to the Red High next weekend to enjoy the football tournament. Itrsquos sure to be good day and all money raised will go to Ballynahinch counselling services and The Edge, as we feel that the Edge contributes enormously to the youth of our town.

He said: ldquoSo far the lads have raised over pound, with great support from past pupils, ex-teachers and of course Quinnyrsquos family.ldquoThese are dferent times now compared to . Mental health awareness is something that people are much more open about these days. It has a high profile in the media too which makes it easier for people to hold up their hands and admit that they are struggling with their own mental health.ldquoIn particular, young people feel a lot of pressure from unhealthy relationships with social media.ldquoBut still, suicide is still very high in Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and other parts of the county.

With maize planted later than usual, owing to the spring rainfall, the potential for frost damage was heightened. However, with long range forecasts pointing toward a warm September, this risk is being reduced.Further, disappointing US trade data added additional pressure to Chicago futures. In response, US funds further extended their net short positions in both maize and wheat futures, expecting markets to fall yet further.With the majority of the Northern Hemisphere grain production harvested or weeks away, weather conditions in the Southern Hemisphere will become of increasing importance.Warm and dry weather in Brazil is forecast to persist, with low soil moisture in both the south and south east regions.

However, cheaper Canadian seed may limit the upside for prices.Soyabeans - Larger than expected sales of US soyabeans to China offers some support. However, large global supplies and weak new crop demand is keeping prices subdued.Global MarketsSoyabean prices fell last week despite larger than expected sales of US beans to China. Greater than expected exports in August offered early support for prices. However, the weight of global supplies and limited new season US soyabean export sales have continued to cap the market.US sales of new crop soyabeans stand at just .Mt, signicantly below last year’s level. Moreover, the improved outlook for crop development will likely add pressure to markets. Temperatures in the US appear warmer over the next fortnight, negating any risk of frost damage for the crop.The area planted to soyabeans in Brazil is expected to increase by just .% , compared with the five year average increase of .%, the smallest season-on-season increase for  years.

However, there has been no confirmation from the inquiry of when it expects the report to be complete and unofficial suggestions of ious publication dates have consistently proved to be incorrect.Ms Bradley said she was “satisfied that the response was swt and thorough.” She added: “Given the volume of evidence gathered it was always envisaged a reasonable amount of time would be required to

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Several motorists were warned about their speed but the sad thing was that two motorists received Fixed Penalty Notices for speeding.“On top of this one motorist obviously didn’t see us driving behind him when he decided to lt his mobile and start chatting to a friend instead of concentrating on the road. As a result this motorist also received a Fixed Penalty Notice for his misjudged action.“I would prefer to inform you that we had a successful day and caught nobody as it truly saddens me to issue these fixed penalty notices but some people just will not learn.“What I also noticed today was that not one person waved to us. That also saddened me as we are only out trying to keep everybody safe, so when you see us out and about please wave at us as it makes our day go in that bit quicker.”Family appeal for missing cat

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/greggssss.jpg","title":"greggs to open new belfast city centre store","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Greggs looks set to open a new store in the heart of Belfast city centre, it can be revealed.
