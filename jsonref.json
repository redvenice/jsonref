[{"url":null,"title":"HARRY WALLOP justify 15 price coffee Alain Ducasse cafe","story":"    A cup of Yemeni coffee from Le Cafe Alain Ducasse cafe in Coal Drops Yard, a new shopping-and-restaurant development near Kings Cross, costs a whopping £15. Harry Wallop said the prices were enough to give him palpitations considerably stronger than you get from caffeineThe cafe is tiny: about eight foot wide and 12 foot long. The staff, dressed in stylish leather and denim aprons, prepare the coffee with ceremony: turning on Brewista kettles that rest on temperature-controlled electronic pads. Customers sit on skinny, uncomfortable stools.Then I saw the prices. They were enough to give me palpitations considerably stronger than you get from caffeine.A cappuccino was £5, and a cup of ‘single-origin’ filter coffee from Kenya or Costa Rica £6.Share this articleBut that was only the bottom half of the menu. At the top was a coffee from France (the Réunion Islands, French overseas territories, grow coffee). It cost £13.Even more shockingly, a Yemeni coffee was £15. That’s correct: I haven’t missed a decimal point. £15 for a filter coffee.I had just eaten steak, chips and salad at a nearby restaurant. That lunch cost less than £15. According to Allegra, the market research company that monitors the coffee shop market, the average price of a high-street cappuccino in the UK is £2.67. Visit McDonald’s and you can get a surprisingly drinkable espresso for 89p.          A cappuccino was £5, and a cup of ‘single-origin’ filter coffee from Kenya or Costa Rica £6I made my excuses and slunk out.But not before slyly taking a picture of the menu and tweeting it with the caption: ‘A single cup of coffee at the tiny, cramped Alain Ducasse cafe in Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross . . . £15. I mean there’s taking the p***, and then there’s inviting revolution.’It was meant as a light-hearted dig at both Ducasse and the Coal Drops Yard development, which is — as the name suggests — the former dumping-ground for all the coal from the north-east of England that, before the Second World War, would arrive by train into King’s Cross.It is now full of achingly cool fashion boutiques and neon art installations. When I first moved to the area in the Nineties, these (by then) derelict Victorian warehouses were the site of an edgy nightclub, prostitutes and drug-dealing.           Alain Ducasse poses with a cup of coffee. His London cafe has described the coffee as \u0027one of the best in the world\u0027It made me smile to think that, 20 years later, they’ve become the site of another form of extortion. But on Twitter, where nuance and humour go to die, people decided that it was worth waging a culture war over £15 coffee.I was accused of being an ‘outrage hunter’ and a ‘prat’ trying to stir up trouble. Others screamed ‘daylight robbery’, and that anyone willing to spend that sort of money on a coffee was ‘clearly a muppet’.Then Ducasse’s general manager Olivier Fellous took to the press to defend his prices: ‘We’re offering an expensive coffee for sure and we know not everyone can afford it,’ he told the London evening paper.But, he insisted, this was ‘one of the finest coffees in the world’.It’s certainly true that exporting coffee from war-torn Yemen is a more complex business than from, say, Brazil or Kenya. Ducasse’s coffee has to go through 60 checkpoints before it gets to the port, according to the chef’s HQ.          This tiny cup of Yemeni coffee cost a whopping £15, with the cheapest item on the menu at the cafe near Kings Cross a hefty £5But even the experts think that £15 for a 250ml cup of coffee, or £59 for a 100g packet of beans — which the cafe also sells — is eye-watering.‘Bloody hell, that’s expensive,’ said Nigel Green, a master coffee roaster for Dorset Coffee Co., which imports Yemeni coffee and roasts it at its base in Dorchester. (Their Yemeni beans cost £28 for 500g, a tenth of the price on a per-gram basis.) Is any cup of coffee worth £15? ‘No. I don’t think it’s right. I’m sorry, but I don’t like elitism in this business. Coffee should be available for everyone to afford.’Others were not surprised at the prices. Ben McCormack, the restaurant reviewer and editor of the Square Meal restaurant guide, said: ‘In France, Alain Ducasse is like the Sun King . . . the god of French cuisine.‘People who dine at his three-star restaurants don’t bat an eyelid at paying hundreds of euros for a meal they are off-the-scale expensive.’At Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athenée, the flagship in Paris, the cheapest starter, a plate of root vegetables with ‘preserved wax cherries and artichoke yoghurt’, will set you back €80 (£68). Main courses go up to €195 (£167): for that you get ‘refreshed Brittany langoustines and golden caviar’.Speaking to me yesterday from Paris, Fellous implored me to try the coffee, assuring me that Ducasse had ‘Michelin stars in his DNA’ and this was no ordinary brew.So that’s what I did. I returned to the cafe and ordered the £15 Yemeni coffee.I was served by Ian, who like the other staff, calls himself a cafelier, rather than a barista. ‘It’s like a sommelier for coffee,’ he said, explaining the coffee was brewed using water heated to exactly 91c any hotter would scald the drink.The water is slowly dripped through a metal filter for three minutes. Strangely, the filter coffee favoured in American sitcoms is now the hipster brew of choice. How the circle turns.The drink was served to me in a miniature glass flask. ‘Let it cool a little,’ implored Ian. ‘The flavour then opens up, the acidity becomes more gentle, going from milk chocolate to honeysuckle sweetness.’It was certainly a different cup of coffee — very delicate, with none of that harsh, dark, roasted flavour you get in many filter coffees. It tasted fresh, almost lemony and it slipped down easily.For some of the clientele, the price was ‘very reasonable’. By chance, at the counter was Phil Wain, a regular customer and editor of Caffeine Magazine, dedicated to chronicling Britain’s addiction to coffee, which now runs to 19.5 million cups a week, according to Allegra.          But Phil Wain, editor of Caffeine Magazine, said of that the £15 price covers more than the coffee.  \u0027It’s all about the experience,\u0027 he said. This is a beautiful space, you get to chat with the cafelier and see the whole process\u0027 ‘These guys are buying their Yemeni coffee from Qima, an importer that has set up a profit share with the farmer. This is better than Fair Trade.’I tell him that I think the coffee is delicious, but I’m struggling to think it’s worth £15 for a cup.‘It’s not just about the coffee, though, is it? . . . It’s all about the experience. This is a beautiful space, you get to chat with the cafelier and see the whole process. My understanding of the whole experience here at Alain Ducasse is that it is very, very reasonable.‘Would you rather queue up at Starbucks and pay only slightly less, or sit here and enjoy the atmosphere? This is a luxurious experience, which for many people is worth the money.’Well, the fuss caused by my tweet has certainly helped sales of Yemeni coffee. Ian says that they’ve sold considerably more in the past 48 hours than usual.But if I had £15 to spend on a coffee, or even £8 for that matter, I could go to Claridge’s hotel and sit in a comfortable armchair, enjoy a free newspaper and watch the world’s A-listers go by.The Yemeni coffee was certainly tasty, but just not £15 tasty. And certainly not when drunk while siting on an uncomfortable, if trendy, stool. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/07/08/272128E300000578-6780971-image-a-14_1551945691544.jpg","title":"BBC tests new hi tech technology including random TV","story":"    The BBC has introduced several new features to help people chose what programmes to watch on iPlayer, which can be linked to normal TVs like this one (pictured) \u0027We want to make choice fun,\u0027 Libby Miller, a senior producer at the BBC research and development unit, told The Times. \u0027Our research showed very strongly how difficult it is to choose things, particularly for people with children, and older couples.\u0027The developments are part of a shift towards improving digital services at the BBC, which its director general is set to warn will be \u0027the only ones some of our audiences use\u0027 in as little as five years. Archers fans up in arms over the BBC Sounds app because it...Michael Jackson\u0027s nephew Taj defends King of Pop on BBC...Share this articleViewers are increasingly moving away from linear channels to digital services such as iPlayer and Netflix, Lord Service will say today on a speech about the future of TV. The director-general will say audiences \u0027need to get value for their £154.50\u0027 licence fee.\u0027Increasingly, they expect to get that value through iPlayer, through BBC Sounds, through News Online,\u0027 he will say.With audiences moving away from linear television to streaming and catch-up services, he will add: \u0027It might be five years away, it might be 10, but soon our digital services will be the only ones some of our audiences use.\u0027          BBC director general Lord Hall (pictured in 2015) will make a speech about the future of TV today In 2016 a loophole that allowed viewers to catch up on shows on BBC iPlayer without paying the licence fee was closed.Lord Hall will say there must be \u0027a new contract\u0027 between the BBC and the public, with a service \u0027that is more personal\u0027.\u0027Not long ago, traditional broadcasters and media organisations could each do our thing and expect audiences to make time to come to us.

Because my heart is so big people betray me and I keep forgiving em,\u0027 he cried.King, without missing a beat, told him he sounded like he was \u0027playing the victim.\u0027 He cried into his hands in response and said: \u0027I\u0027m just telling the truth!

The Motion Picture and Television Fund is supported by a lot of people from Hollywood … it’s a good idea, because I think the success of the A-list stars, if they realize that the success of the minority is based on the work of a lot of people around. And they give something back.’He adds: ‘That is a good way to send respect for the people who are not in the focus.’The campus, open to residents age 70 and over, offers impressive facilities the grounds include acres of walking paths, rose gardens, a community greenhouse, a putting green, dining options, a café, lounges and game rooms. In addition to options for independent living such as the cottages and bungalows, there’s a long-term care facility with 40 beds and a specialized Alzheimer’s and Dementia unit called Harry’s haven – named in memory of Kirk Douglas’ father, Harry Deminsky.Perhaps most importantly, however, the home features multiple creative outlets. There’s a 247 closed-circuit channel that showcases the original work of residents. There’s a studio, a writing group, and reading and video libraries. ‘Creativity is ageless,’ the MPTF community’s website boasts.And that’s exactly what filmmaker Gaulke – clearly enamored with the place and its residents – witnessed firsthand.‘The atmosphere at the retirement home, there was this kind of energy, this kind of creativity – and every one of the residents was interested in doing something, and they had all the facilities to do this,’ he tells DailyMail.com. ‘What impressed me was that their whole life, they were struggling. They had to earn money and they had to work hard, and now they were free to do what they want.’Gaulke’s film showcases a broad array of MPTF residents, all of them brimming with personality. Among them is actress Sawyer, who sadly passed away at the age of 105 before the film’s international debut.Growing up in Oakland, California, she dreamed of being an actress, but her father made her go to business school. She lasted three weeks in an office job before she quit and started acting on stage and screen, forging a lifelong career performing. She lights up as she watches herself on screen as a young woman, acting alongside Susan Hayward, Dean Martin and other luminaries.‘Do you know what she’d eat for lunch?’ she says of Hayward in the documentary. ‘A tomato and a hard-boiled egg. No wonder she had such a little waist.’Sawyer continued auditioning almost up until her death in recent years, she appeared in everything from Ray Donovan and New Girl to How I Met Your Mother and The Office.Other actor residents featured include Faulkner and King – but many members of the MPTF retirement community built their careers behind the screen.Producer Daniel Selznick, for example, may not be instantly recognizable, but he comes from what is akin to Hollywood royalty – and has been responsible for blockbuster successes himself.Both of his grandfathers were studio executives, including Louis Mayer, the head of MGM – who’d playfully bite his grandson’s arm when he visited the studio, pretending to be the iconic MGM lion, Selznick grins in the documentary.His father, David Selznick, was the award-winning producer of Gone With The Wind.‘My parents didn’t insist that I go into the film business they said, you know, “You can choose it if you like, but we won’t be unhappy if you don’t choose it.”’          The campus, open to residents age 70 and over, offers impressive facilities the grounds include acres of walking paths, rose gardens, a community greenhouse, a putting green, dining options, a café, lounges and game rooms  Actress Anne Faulkner, right, played a recurring role as the boss of Roseanne Barr on the ribald comedian’s titular sitcom, left, appearing in most scenes alongside a young George Clooney – who, to this day, lights up when he sees her          Screenwriter Tony Lawrence, right, who worked on projects ranging from The Twilight Zone to Bonanza, moved to the MPTF Home with his wife more than a decade ago.

After the elder Selznick’s death, however, ‘I felt badly about the fact that I’d never worked in motion pictures,’Selznick was 28, and he took a job at Universal Studios, working in ‘a new unit for low-budget movies that will appeal to the younger audiences under 30.’ One of the films Selznick selected was a screenplay by two USC students, attached to an up-and-coming director – named George Lucas. The film was American Graffiti.‘The film cost $750,000 and ended up grossing $60million,’ Selznick says in the documentary, proudly proclaiming it the ‘highest percentage in the history of Hollywood of budget to gross to this day. And so George became a star overnight.‘Then he was invited to go to 20th Century Fox to make Star Wars – so you can say the rest is history.’He ended up at the MPTF home after the sudden death of his wife.‘A number of my friends kind of converged on me and said, “Daniel, why don’t you move to the Motion Picture Relief Fund?” It took a little bit of persuading, but not too much,’ he says in the documentary.While many of the residents, such as Selznick and Sawyer, come to the home alone, the facility is also open to spouses of industry professionals, even if they work in different fields producer Joel Rogosin, for example, lives there with his wife, Deborah, a psychotherapist. The hilarious pair are heavily featured in the documentary as they work on a book together offering advice to other couples on how to stay married (they can’t agree on the title, which is delaying publication.)Screenwriter Tony Lawrence, who worked on projects ranging from The Twilight Zone to Bonanza, moved to the MPTF Home with his wife more than a decade ago. When she sadly passed away, he decided to stay.‘I had a choice of moving out or staying here, and I stayed here because there were so many things available to me,’ he says in the documentary.From Queen Anne to the Queen of Hollywood: Olivia Colman has...Men and women will BOTH start collecting their state pension...Shower hostess with the mostest!

Controversial plans drawn up by Lincolnshire County Council would see the Yorkstone cobbles of Stamford\u0027s Red Lion Square replaced with TarmacAs well as the square with cobbles, or setts, Stamford has honey-coloured buildings and Collyweston stone slate roofs to help make it a dream location for period dramas. The 17th-century traveller Celia Fiennes hailed it ‘as fine a built town all of stone as may be seen’. But this historic beauty will be ruined by the resurfacing plans, warned the Stamford Civic Society.Chairman Jim Mason said: ‘If you come into Stamford on a tour, you’ll walk into that square and it should be a delight and surprise feature. It’s much more appropriate that this is surfaced in something like stone setts that match the surroundings.’ Andy Moore, chairman of the society’s Urban Group, said some stones had come loose because the sand between them had not been topped up.

Harry Wallop said the prices were enough to give him palpitations considerably stronger than you get from caffeineThe cafe is tiny: about eight foot wide and 12 foot long. The staff, dressed in stylish leather and denim aprons, prepare the coffee with ceremony: turning on Brewista kettles that rest on temperature-controlled electronic pads. Customers sit on skinny, uncomfortable stools.Then I saw the prices. They were enough to give me palpitations considerably stronger than you get from caffeine.A cappuccino was £5, and a cup of ‘single-origin’ filter coffee from Kenya or Costa Rica £6.Share this articleBut that was only the bottom half of the menu. At the top was a coffee from France (the Réunion Islands, French overseas territories, grow coffee). It cost £13.Even more shockingly, a Yemeni coffee was £15. That’s correct: I haven’t missed a decimal point. £15 for a filter coffee.I had just eaten steak, chips and salad at a nearby restaurant. That lunch cost less than £15. According to Allegra, the market research company that monitors the coffee shop market, the average price of a high-street cappuccino in the UK is £2.67. Visit McDonald’s and you can get a surprisingly drinkable espresso for 89p.          A cappuccino was £5, and a cup of ‘single-origin’ filter coffee from Kenya or Costa Rica £6I made my excuses and slunk out.But not before slyly taking a picture of the menu and tweeting it with the caption: ‘A single cup of coffee at the tiny, cramped Alain Ducasse cafe in Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross . . . £15. I mean there’s taking the p***, and then there’s inviting revolution.’It was meant as a light-hearted dig at both Ducasse and the Coal Drops Yard development, which is — as the name suggests — the former dumping-ground for all the coal from the north-east of England that, before the Second World War, would arrive by train into King’s Cross.It is now full of achingly cool fashion boutiques and neon art installations. When I first moved to the area in the Nineties, these (by then) derelict Victorian warehouses were the site of an edgy nightclub, prostitutes and drug-dealing.           Alain Ducasse poses with a cup of coffee. His London cafe has described the coffee as \u0027one of the best in the world\u0027It made me smile to think that, 20 years later, they’ve become the site of another form of extortion. But on Twitter, where nuance and humour go to die, people decided that it was worth waging a culture war over £15 coffee.I was accused of being an ‘outrage hunter’ and a ‘prat’ trying to stir up trouble. Others screamed ‘daylight robbery’, and that anyone willing to spend that sort of money on a coffee was ‘clearly a muppet’.Then Ducasse’s general manager Olivier Fellous took to the press to defend his prices: ‘We’re offering an expensive coffee for sure and we know not everyone can afford it,’ he told the London evening paper.But, he insisted, this was ‘one of the finest coffees in the world’.It’s certainly true that exporting coffee from war-torn Yemen is a more complex business than from, say, Brazil or Kenya. Ducasse’s coffee has to go through 60 checkpoints before it gets to the port, according to the chef’s HQ.          This tiny cup of Yemeni coffee cost a whopping £15, with the cheapest item on the menu at the cafe near Kings Cross a hefty £5But even the experts think that £15 for a 250ml cup of coffee, or £59 for a 100g packet of beans — which the cafe also sells — is eye-watering.‘Bloody hell, that’s expensive,’ said Nigel Green, a master coffee roaster for Dorset Coffee Co., which imports Yemeni coffee and roasts it at its base in Dorchester. (Their Yemeni beans cost £28 for 500g, a tenth of the price on a per-gram basis.) Is any cup of coffee worth £15? ‘No. I don’t think it’s right. I’m sorry, but I don’t like elitism in this business. Coffee should be available for everyone to afford.’Others were not surprised at the prices. Ben McCormack, the restaurant reviewer and editor of the Square Meal restaurant guide, said: ‘In France, Alain Ducasse is like the Sun King . . . the god of French cuisine.‘People who dine at his three-star restaurants don’t bat an eyelid at paying hundreds of euros for a meal they are off-the-scale expensive.’At Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athenée, the flagship in Paris, the cheapest starter, a plate of root vegetables with ‘preserved wax cherries and artichoke yoghurt’, will set you back €80 (£68). Main courses go up to €195 (£167): for that you get ‘refreshed Brittany langoustines and golden caviar’.Speaking to me yesterday from Paris, Fellous implored me to try the coffee, assuring me that Ducasse had ‘Michelin stars in his DNA’ and this was no ordinary brew.So that’s what I did. I returned to the cafe and ordered the £15 Yemeni coffee.I was served by Ian, who like the other staff, calls himself a cafelier, rather than a barista. ‘It’s like a sommelier for coffee,’ he said, explaining the coffee was brewed using water heated to exactly 91c any hotter would scald the drink.The water is slowly dripped through a metal filter for three minutes. Strangely, the filter coffee favoured in American sitcoms is now the hipster brew of choice. How the circle turns.The drink was served to me in a miniature glass flask. ‘Let it cool a little,’ implored Ian. ‘The flavour then opens up, the acidity becomes more gentle, going from milk chocolate to honeysuckle sweetness.’It was certainly a different cup of coffee — very delicate, with none of that harsh, dark, roasted flavour you get in many filter coffees. It tasted fresh, almost lemony and it slipped down easily.For some of the clientele, the price was ‘very reasonable’. By chance, at the counter was Phil Wain, a regular customer and editor of Caffeine Magazine, dedicated to chronicling Britain’s addiction to coffee, which now runs to 19.5 million cups a week, according to Allegra.          But Phil Wain, editor of Caffeine Magazine, said of that the £15 price covers more than the coffee.  \u0027It’s all about the experience,\u0027 he said. This is a beautiful space, you get to chat with the cafelier and see the whole process\u0027 ‘These guys are buying their Yemeni coffee from Qima, an importer that has set up a profit share with the farmer. This is better than Fair Trade.’I tell him that I think the coffee is delicious, but I’m struggling to think it’s worth £15 for a cup.‘It’s not just about the coffee, though, is it? . . . It’s all about the experience. This is a beautiful space, you get to chat with the cafelier and see the whole process. My understanding of the whole experience here at Alain Ducasse is that it is very, very reasonable.‘Would you rather queue up at Starbucks and pay only slightly less, or sit here and enjoy the atmosphere? This is a luxurious experience, which for many people is worth the money.’Well, the fuss caused by my tweet has certainly helped sales of Yemeni coffee. Ian says that they’ve sold considerably more in the past 48 hours than usual.But if I had £15 to spend on a coffee, or even £8 for that matter, I could go to Claridge’s hotel and sit in a comfortable armchair, enjoy a free newspaper and watch the world’s A-listers go by.The Yemeni coffee was certainly tasty, but just not £15 tasty. And certainly not when drunk while siting on an uncomfortable, if trendy, stool. "},{"url":null,"title":"Chinas Huawei sues US federal ban using products","story":"    Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant, has accused the United States of hacking into its serversGuo said the company was seeking unspecified damages.\u0027The U.S. government is sparing no effort to smear the company,\u0027 he said at a news conference at the tech giant\u0027s corporate headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen.Guo even countered that the U.S. government \u0027has hacked our servers and stolen our emails and source code\u0027, without providing details.Washington has long considered Huawei a potential threat, fears originally centring on the background of founder Ren Zhengfei, a former Chinese army engineer.The concerns have escalated as Huawei has risen to become the world leader in telecom networking equipment that connects much of the world, and one of the top smartphone manufacturers alongside Samsung and Apple.Share this articleThe lawsuit says the legislation is an \u0027unconstitutional exercise of executive andor judicial power\u0027 and deprived Huawei of a \u0027fair hearing\u0027 to rebut the allegations against it.A law recently enacted by Beijing that obliges Chinese companies to aid the government on national security has added to the concerns about Huawei.The U.S. has warned that Huawei\u0027s equipment could be manipulated by China\u0027s Communist government to spy on other countries and disrupt critical communications, and is urging nations to shun the company.This comes just as the world readies for the roll-out of ultra-fast 5G telecommunications, an advancement in which Huawei will play a key role and which will allow widespread adoption of next-generation technologies like artificial intelligence.Huawei has responded to the pressure with an aggressive PR campaign in recent months, with its reclusive founder Ren Zhengfei emerging to deny the claims in foreign media interviews.This week the company gave news organisations a tightly guarded tour of its massive production lines and R\u0026ampD facilities in southern Guangdong province.The clash is heightened by ongoing U.S.-China trade talks and the December arrest of Huawei\u0027s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, Ren\u0027s daughter.          Huawei has been making headlines in recent weeks after the December arrest of its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted in the United States for allegedly violating sanctions against IranA Canadian court on Wednesday set a May 8 date for the start of Meng\u0027s hearing into a U.S. extradition request over charges that she and Huawei circumvented U.S. sanctions against Iran. Two affiliates also have been charged with stealing trade secrets from telecommunications group T-Mobile.Two Canadians were subsequently detained in China in suspected retaliation over Meng\u0027s arrest.Huawei officials said the company, which operates in 170 countries, had never been party to any major security breaches and never received any request from the Chinese government to install security \u0027backdoors\u0027 in its equipment or to gather intelligence.Chief legal officer Song Liuping acknowledged, however, that Chinese laws may require Huawei to respond to government requests for assistance but said it would only do so in matters such as terrorism or criminal activity.\u0027But if this went beyond express stipulations of the law, we would reject such a request,\u0027 Song said, adding that installing backdoors would be commercial \u0027suicide\u0027 if such things were revealed.Huawei officials denied that the privately held company was \u0027owned or influenced\u0027 by China\u0027s government.Some China-watchers, however, say it is highly unlikely that Ren could have steered his company to such heights in such a strategic sector without the support of Beijing, which has clearly stated its goal of becoming the world\u0027s high-tech leader.Much of the U.S. concern is rooted in fears that China, through Huawei, may export the high-tech security state that is accelerating under President Xi Jinping.Guo suggested the U.S. campaign to contain Huawei was prompted in part by the US\u0027s belated realisation that the company had become a rival to American tech leaders.Huawei\u0027s equipment is seen as considerably more advanced than that of competitors such as Sweden\u0027s Ericsson or Finland\u0027s Nokia.\u0027Is it afraid that other countries may catch up to and overtake its use of advanced 5G technologies?\u0027 Guo asked."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/03/07/08/272128E300000578-6780971-image-a-14_1551945691544.jpg","title":"BBC tests new hi tech technology including random TV","story":"    The BBC has introduced several new features to help people chose what programmes to watch on iPlayer, which can be linked to normal TVs like this one (pictured) \u0027We want to make choice fun,\u0027 Libby Miller, a senior producer at the BBC research and development unit, told The Times. \u0027Our research showed very strongly how difficult it is to choose things, particularly for people with children, and older couples.\u0027The developments are part of a shift towards improving digital services at the BBC, which its director general is set to warn will be \u0027the only ones some of our audiences use\u0027 in as little as five years. Archers fans up in arms over the BBC Sounds app because it...Michael Jackson\u0027s nephew Taj defends King of Pop on BBC...Share this articleViewers are increasingly moving away from linear channels to digital services such as iPlayer and Netflix, Lord Service will say today on a speech about the future of TV. The director-general will say audiences \u0027need to get value for their £154.50\u0027 licence fee.\u0027Increasingly, they expect to get that value through iPlayer, through BBC Sounds, through News Online,\u0027 he will say.With audiences moving away from linear television to streaming and catch-up services, he will add: \u0027It might be five years away, it might be 10, but soon our digital services will be the only ones some of our audiences use.\u0027          BBC director general Lord Hall (pictured in 2015) will make a speech about the future of TV today In 2016 a loophole that allowed viewers to catch up on shows on BBC iPlayer without paying the licence fee was closed.Lord Hall will say there must be \u0027a new contract\u0027 between the BBC and the public, with a service \u0027that is more personal\u0027.\u0027Not long ago, traditional broadcasters and media organisations could each do our thing and expect audiences to make time to come to us.

But the DUP’s Westminster leader now looks set to be a central player in determining if there is a way for the UK out of the Brexit quagmire.In April 2013, he was carted off to hospital by ambulance when he collapsed at work at Westminster. Months later on the Twelfth of July he was knocked unconscious when struck by a brick hurled by a loyalist rioter during one of the regular parades disputes in north Belfast.But the biggest blow that he, his MEP wife Diane and two surviving children suffered was in 1998 when his eight-year-old son Andrew, who suffered from spina bifida, died unexpectedly.Two years earlier when Dodds was visiting Andrew at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children, the IRA carried out a gun attack, wounding one of his police guards. The officer recovered from the injuries suffered in what Dodds described as a “grotesque” incident. The IRA said the attack was not against the politician, but rather the RUC.“I have no way of knowing if that is true or not,” says Dodds in his north Belfast office ahead of a flight to London for another bout of very serious Brexit politics. “But certainly a lot of people are convinced that it was more than just the police officers the IRA was targeting.”The memories of Andrew are alive and strong for all the family. “He brought a lot of joy to people. He was very outgoing. Death was very sudden, it was a big shock to us . . . You never get over that, you live with it.”Dodds started his political career as Ian Paisley’s chief aide in the European Parliament where the late DUP leader was an MEP.“Andrew was a very bright wee boy. He had no inhibitions about going up to people and speaking to them. Ian Paisley used to think this was hilarious. He enjoyed a bit of joshing with him.”‘Moral bankruptcy’Dodds says the juxtaposition of the 1996 attack with doctors and nurses caring for gravely ill children and parents visiting those children demonstrated the “absolute moral bankruptcy of the IRA and what they were about”.But still that experience didn’t prevent him and the DUP going into the Northern Executive with Sinn Féin. He says he would be happy to do so again if the powersharing administration could be reinstated.For years there appeared to be a natural succession chart framed on the wall of DUP headquarters: Ian Paisley, then Peter Robinson and then Dodds, but instead he surprisingly swerved away from the leadership when Robinson stood down in 2015, Arlene Foster taking over instead.His argument remains that it did not make sense to be leader when he was over at Westminster as an MP rather than at Stormont as an Assembly member where most Northern Ireland business was done. Some wondered did those knocks convince him he did not need the stress of the leadership. Not so, says Dodds.Regardless, he is under pressure again. He is the DUP leader in the House of Commons and in a real sense one of the most powerful politicians in Britain. The DUP holds the balance of power and how he and his fellow nine DUP MPs vote in next week’s Brexit vote or votes may decide if there is some resolution to the Brexit conundrum. There is a hint of movement. Over recent days he has been pivotal to an initiative portrayed as an olive branch from hardline Brexiteers to Theresa May. He was selected as one of eight lawyers for Jacob Rees Mogg’s hardline European Research Group (ERG) deputed to propose some compromise that could reconcile the bitterly conflicting positions of Leavers and Remainers.That work continues apace and probably will run to the eleventh hour and maybe a bit beyond as well. That’s about finding a solution that ensures no hard border on the island of Ireland and doesn’t dilute, as unionists claim is inherent in the backstop, Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom.How to square that circle has baffled great political and legal minds. “There is definitely a way through this. Whether there are people in Brussels and Dublin who are prepared to make changes remains to be seen,” says Dodds.He argues that Michel Barnier and Leo Varadkar would need to be in the mood for accommodation as well, and reflects on how ahead of the 2016 Brexit referendum the then British prime minister David Cameron was sent home from Brussels with his tail between his legs when he sought concessions to try to carry the Remain case.“If history were to repeat itself I think Europe might be much more favourably disposed to a David Cameron-like ask,” he says.Dodds was born in 1958 in the same Waterside General Hospital in Derry as another DUP MP Gregory Campbell – “I’m not sure what you can draw from that,” he offers. His late father Joe – who was a DUP councillor in Fermanagh – was a customs officer. They then moved to Enniskillen where Dodds spent most of his boyhood, attending Portora Royal School. He went to Cambridge in 1977 to study law, emerging with a first. Initially, Cambridge was a shock. “I came from Fermanagh, never having been out of Northern Ireland much, into this very grand institution, feeling very much an inferiority complex as very many people form Northern Ireland do coming to these sorts of places.“But I very soon realised that actually we were as good as anyone else there. I enjoyed the stimulus, the debates, the political activity, the legal challenge – it was like opening up a whole new world to me. I enjoyed it immensely.”He also enjoyed the break from the Troubles. He returned, however, for a year to Queen’s to prepare for what probably would have been a lucrative life at the bar. It was there he met his wife Diana who was studying history, and as an MEP should shortly be out of a job.His mother Doreen still occasionally muses, as does he, what life would have been like if he had taken the legal rather than the political path. “I got the offer to work with Ian in the European Parliament which was a fabulous opportunity. Once I took that route it meant the law took second place. Politics is either in your blood or it is not.”Incendiary quotesChatting to Dodds you don’t get the same lively and often incendiary quotes you can readily elicit from Sammy Wilson. Dodds is the soft cop in this project. Equally he has survived in the brutal sectarian cockpit of North Belfast where against Sinn Féin encroachment he has held his House of Commons seat since 2001. So, he can fight dirty. But generally he is considered and measured in his comments.He allows, up to a point, that the DUP’s staunch line on Brexit has helped give rise to the civic nationalist movement.In the past year former DUP leader Peter Robinson made a couple of key speeches advising unionists to be mindful of demographic changes and how it was vital for them to achieve rapprochement with nationalism.“Unionists would be wise not to disregard what he is saying,” agrees Dodds. But notwithstanding the tumult of the UK quitting the EU he believes the position is retrievable once Brexit is resolved – if that is possible. And he believes too that unionism, so to speak, “gets it” – that it is not unattuned to the shifting political zeitgeist.“I don’t think anyone in unionism today fails to grasp the fact that we do need to work together, that we need to have a powersharing government, that we need to have a good relationship North and South, and we need to have a situation where people are comfortable with Northern Ireland and the union.“Brexit has changed some of the dynamic but I am reasonably optimistic that once we work through our period of uncertainty and the worst of the fears that are out there on all sides, that we can begin to get that consensus in Northern Ireland.”Dodds is 60 now. He understands, based on experience, that as you get older you must be mindful of the pressures and the problems they can cause – you have to look after your health. “But I feel fine,” he says. “There are a lot of challenges that I have to see through.

They said she was a special dog, that she brought luck to the expedition,” Mr Wargowsky said. “Some even thought she was blessed.”At one point Mera spent two nights sleeping out exposed on a glacier leading Mr Wargowsky to fear she would die of cold. But she seemed unharmed and later shared his tent and ate his food.On the day of the final ascent, he said she seemed unconcerned by the altitude or precipices on either side and bounded ahead of the group.“I have no clue if she’d been up there before, but she seemed very confident in what she was doing,” he said.She ran ahead of him on the final ridge approaching the summit and waited for him panting with her tongue out, he said.“I’d never been on top of something like that with a dog. She was leaning up against me and wanting to be petted. It was pretty surreal.”Mera now lives with the expedition\u0027s base camp manager, Kaji Sherpa, he said. Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Kew murder: Body of woman, 34, found in shallow grave two days after she was reported missingBrexit latest news: EU gives UK 48 hours to come up with new plan for backstop toThree dead after mortar attack on high-profile political gathering in KabulThe Queen publishes her first Instagram postFrench cardinal mooted as possible future pope convicted of covering up child sexual abuseCountdown to Brexit: \u0026#39If we extend Article 50, I fear we will never leave\u0026#39 - our young readers on leaving the EU Leaving Neverland: who is Brett Barnes, Jackson’s ‘other boy’?Labour faces formal inquiry over handling of anti-Semitism amid claims it breached equalities lawThe Aids endgame: how the UK and US are committed to wiping out HIVBlow for Thai democracy as opposition party is disbanded for nominating princess as prime ministerAssad accused of crimes against humanity in \u0026#39breakthrough\u0026#39 case at The HagueLent 2019: What to give up, how long it lasts and the meaning behind the datesGwyneth Paltrow turns trip adviser: Are hallucinogens the next big thing?Comment: Why I\u0026#39m joining the fight to end the silence around women in conflictTeenager arrested after deaths of woman and young child in IpswichPolice plan £10m surge in extra officers and new stop-and-search powers - as another man dies in knife crime epidemicThousands of offenders caught with knives are escaping justice amid 25pc slump in chargesCyber attacks rob future elections of their legitimacy, Jeremy Hunt warnsTrendy peanut butter snacks contain \u0026#39as many calories as a meal\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 7 march 2019","story":"Rachel Curwen, Collections Care Assistant at inspects the collection of copper pans in the kitchen at Harewood House.

It will decide our future, whether we can continue on our path,” he said, urging party supporters to stay at home out of fear of unrest. The dissolution verdict was widely expected. Five of the nine judges overseeing the case have in the past ruled against other politicians deemed to be allies of Mr Shinawatra, who left the country after a 2006 coup. Human rights groups were swift to condemn the verdict. Brad Adams, Asia director of Human Rights Watch warned that the ruling showed that Thailand was moving towards a “bogus” election. “Thailand’s military junta and the Palang Pracharat party it controls have used every dirty trick in the book to tilt the political playing field their way and now the constitutional court just did them a big favour with a highly dubious ruling that destroys a major opposition political party,” he said. Leading candidate Chaturon Chaisang on the campaign trail ahead of the court verdict“PM General Prayut Chan-ocha and elites behind him are clearly quite keen to establish a sock-puppet democracy, one which keeps a passing resemblance to popular rule while soldiers control all the power,” added Mr Adams. “The big losers today in the dissolution of Thai Raksa Chat Party are the Thai people and their hopes for a return to a rights-respecting democracy.” The TRC would have boosted Pheu Thai’s ability to form a government in a newly crafted proportional representation system in the 500-seat House of Representatives, although some analysts argue that the party’s voters will switch to other democratic forces and not to the regime’s Palang Pracharat.  In the run-up to the court decision, Thai Raksa Chart continued to hit the campaign trail across the country, focussing its agenda on improving Thailand’s moribund economy and raising living standards. While meeting voters at the Damnoen Saduak floating market on the outskirts of Bangkok on Sunday, Chaturon Chaisang, a former deputy prime minister and one of the party’s leading lights, told The  that “we don’t believe that this election will be free and fair.”He added: “The fundamental problem of this country is the fact that democracy has been interrupted by several coups.” Mr Chaisang was unavailable for comment immediately after the verdict. Please review our commenting policyKew murder: Body of woman, 34, found in shallow grave two days after she was reported missingBrexit latest news: EU gives UK 48 hours to come up with new plan for backstop toThree dead after mortar attack on high-profile political gathering in KabulThe Queen publishes her first Instagram postFrench cardinal mooted as possible future pope convicted of covering up child sexual abuseCountdown to Brexit: \u0026#39If we extend Article 50, I fear we will never leave\u0026#39 - our young readers on leaving the EU Leaving Neverland: who is Brett Barnes, Jackson’s ‘other boy’?Labour faces formal inquiry over handling of anti-Semitism amid claims it breached equalities lawThe Aids endgame: how the UK and US are committed to wiping out HIVAssad accused of crimes against humanity in \u0026#39breakthrough\u0026#39 case at The HagueLent 2019: What to give up, how long it lasts and the meaning behind the datesGwyneth Paltrow turns trip adviser: Are hallucinogens the next big thing?Comment: Why I\u0026#39m joining the fight to end the silence around women in conflictTeenager arrested after deaths of woman and young child in IpswichPolice plan £10m surge in extra officers and new stop-and-search powers - as another man dies in knife crime epidemicThousands of offenders caught with knives are escaping justice amid 25pc slump in chargesPublic satisfaction over the NHS is lowest in a decade, despite £20bn ‘birthday boost’Cyber attacks rob future elections of their legitimacy, Jeremy Hunt warnsTrendy peanut butter snacks contain \u0026#39as many calories as a meal\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/09/15/brexit-betrayal-march-14.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6736721  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/12/09/15/brexit-betrayal-march-14.jpg","title":"brexit no deal recession economy impact oecd","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In its latest economic outlook, the OECD said growth is expected to remain weak in the UK for the foreseeable future. Based on a smooth Brexit and a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, the OECD has forecast GDP growth of below 1 per cent in the next two years. However, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by around 2 per cent in the UK for the next two years. The OECD said: “The effects could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to EU trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross-border supply chains.”The group said the costs associated with a cliff-edge departure from the EU could be magnified by a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruption in financial markets.

Meanwhile, the think tank said the impact of trade arrangements on WTO terms would vary across the EU, with smaller countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark “relatively exposed”. The biggest impact would be felt in the agriculture, machinery and equipment sectors. The OECD’s predictions echo previous warnings from the Bank of England, which last year said a no deal could plunge the UK into a larger recession that the global financial crisis 10 years ago if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. Based on the bank’s worst case scenario modelling, the UK economy would contract by 8 per cent, house prices would fall by a third, unemployment would spike to 7.5 per cent, interest rates would shoot up to 5.5 per cent and the value of the pound would fall to below $1.We’ll tell you what’s true.

What will these votes mean for the UK economy, jobs and wages?\u0026nbspThe Brexit vote has hit growth. There is a strong consensus that, to date, the UK economy is perhaps 1 to 2 per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been (and, correspondingly, real household incomes are 1 to 2 per cent\u0026nbsplower).\u0026nbspThat was mostly down to the impact of the fall in the pound in the immediate aftermath of the referendum.More recently, growth in the final quarter of 2018 was 0.2 per cent – weak, but not disastrous. But the most up-to-date data is considerably worse looking at the monthly data, there’s been essentially no growth since the summer. Part of this reflects global economic developments – the eurozone economy is also weak.Created with Sketch.

I fear elements of the Brexit white paper will inevitably put me in direct conflict with the views expressed by a large section of my constituents. I am not prepared to compromise their wishes to deliver a watered-down Brexit.But there are obvious Brexit effects as well, in particular the slowdown in business investment and a record rise in “stockpiling”, as factories try desperately to ensure that they won’t run short of vital components if trade is disrupted by a no-deal\u0026nbspBrexit. \u0026nbspIf no deal actually materialises, it seems likely we’d see a further significant fall in sterling, pushing up import prices and inflation, and reducing real wages.\u0026nbspConsiderably more worrying, however, would be the impact\u0026nbspon consumer and business confidence, and hence spending. Businesses would be hit by rising input prices, resulting both from the fall in sterling and the need to replace EU imports with more expensive ones sourced from outside the EU.Consumers would face rising inflation at a time when they will be trying to reduce discretionary spending, and with little prospect of large pay rises. Any actual disruption to business activities, through the disruption of supply chains or cutting off access to EU export markets, would come on top of this – and could be very severe indeed.To some extent, these could and would be mitigated by policy actions from the UK government. The Bank of England would be likely to raise interest rates more slowly than it otherwise would have done. And although the deficit will widen if the economy slows, the government will –\u0026nbspvery sensibly –\u0026nbsprespond to that as Gordon Brown did in 2008 by spending more, not less. The government has learnt\u0026nbspfrom George Osborne’s mistakes.\u0026nbspNo-deal Brexit could push UK into recession, think tank warnsWould all this mean a recession?\u0026nbspI’d be very surprised if it doesn’t – and indeed I’ve put my money where my mouth is, but it will of course depend crucially on political developments.If the UK and the EU keep talking and try to minimise the damage, we might get away with a relatively limited downturn. If things spiral out of control with tit-for-tat measures, then it could be very grim indeed.Over the longer term, it will be the future trading arrangements between the UK and the EU27 (and, to a lesser extent, the rest of the world) that determines the long-term economic impact\u0026nbspof Brexit.\u0026nbspUnder no deal, the UK and the EU would revert to trading under rules governed by World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements, although the default assumption must be that when the dust settles, various bilateral agreements to facilitate trade within the WTO framework would likely be agreed.\u0026nbspCredible estimates of the long-term impact of this on the UK economy suggest that it would reduce output by up to 10 per cent. And – unlike the inherently unpredictable short-term consequences of a “chaotic Brexit”\u0026nbsp– these can be modelled quantitatively using standard economic models.The government’s own estimates are that this would reduce GDP and wages by 8-10 per cent\u0026nbspover the next 15 years.\u0026nbspOf course, whatever happens with Brexit, many other factors – including UK domestic economic policy – will drive economic growth between 2018 and 2033.The expectation is still that the UK economy will continue to grow. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that a hard\u0026nbspBrexit would prove a significant drag on growth over the medium to long term.What about if the deal is passed? Business will undoubtedly breath a sigh of relief as the immediate threat of no deal is lifted. But while the government claims that the deal offers business certainty, that is only true only in the short term, and only by comparison to the chaos of no deal. A transition period will guarantee the status quo until at least the end of 2020, but we still know little about what happens after that.\u0026nbspThe deal sets out a broad framework – the “political declaration” for the future relationship between the UK and the EU – but only a framework, which is not binding on either side. And given that political instability both in the UK and continental Europe seems far more likely than not, it is unclear how much it will constrain negotiations.\u0026nbspWhat is certain is that just, as in the Article 50 negotiations, the UK will have by far the weaker hand, and will need to make big concessions on issues from fish to financial services.Sterling would rise and confidence would recover to more normal levels, but the long-term question marks over the UK economy and its access to European markets would remain. For these reasons forecasts of a “Brexit boom” after a deal seem misplaced it’s more likely to be a “dead cat bounce”. Particularly given that – for reasons that have nothing to do with Brexit – world trade growth is already slowing, UK growth seems likely to remain fairly disappointing this year.What about the long-term impact\u0026nbspof May’s deal?\u0026nbspAssuming that the future relationship is indeed based on the customs backstop written into the withdrawal agreement, then there will be no tariffs on UK-EU trade, no customs checks at the border and no need for firms to satisfy rules of origin requirements. All good news, especially for manufacturing. However, for the UK’s dominant service\u0026nbspsector – 80 per cent\u0026nbspof the economy, nearly half of exports to the EU, and almost certainly the main driver of future export growth – the news is much worse.\u0026nbspLeaving the single market will mean substantial new barriers to UK companies, and there is little or nothing in the political declaration to suggest we will get much in the way of special treatment.\u0026nbspAnd we are not just talking about the City and financial services here, but a whole range of sectors from broadcasting to transport. Indeed, while UK manufactures are furious with the government’s handling of the negotiations, most economists find it even more baffling that the UK government has essentially done nothing to protect the interest of some of the most dynamic and successful sectors of the UK economy.Nor are trade deals with non-EU countries likely to make up the difference.\u0026nbspRecent days have shown how large the obstacles will be to any UK-US trade deal, which would inevitably involve major concessions by the UK in politically difficult areas – not just chlorinated chicken.\u0026nbspIndeed, the UK is likely to be in a considerably weaker position in negotiating such deals than it would be within the EU.\u0026nbspSo the overall impact of May’s deal, while considerably smaller than no deal, will still be negative – the government’s estimates, which may be optimistic, are of a hit to GDP of 2 to 4 per cent our own estimates are 2 per cent\u0026nbspto 5.5 per cent. And if Theresa May is replaced by a more hardline Brexiteer who seeks to negotiate his or her way out of the backstop, and hence a customs union, the prognosis will be considerably worse – much closer to the no-deal scenario.\u0026nbspWhat this means is that while no deal is clearly worse for the economy than the deal on the table, and comes with further unpredictable downsides, there are big negatives to Theresa May’s deal both continued uncertainty for the next couple of years and the likelihood of a very damaging outcome for important parts of the UK economy, leading to a significant drag on growth for the medium term.And finally, what if we “kick the can” and seek an extension of the Article 50 process? In the short term, this is the outcome which maximises uncertainty, since nothing will be resolved.\u0026nbspMost businesses would nevertheless prefer it to the certain downsides of no deal but it clearly is not a solution.During the period of extension, businesses would still have to plan for the possibility of no deal, even while hoping for something better. If – and this is of course a big if – it led to a softer\u0026nbspBrexit, which at least left open the possibility of continued customs union and single market membership (including freedom of movement) then the long-term economic downsides of Brexit would largely vanish.\u0026nbspBut if it simply leads to a delayed no deal, or a slightly tweaked version of the same deal, then it’s hard to see what we would gain.So our MPs are in a bind.\u0026nbspThere is no option that will resolve the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the UK economy any time soon, and none which can credibly claim to avert the risk of substantial long-term damage.\u0026nbspThe chancellor famously claimed that “no one voted to be poorer”. Maybe, maybe not. But next week most of our elected representatives will almost certainly – one way or the other – do just that.\u0026nbspJonathan Portes is a senior fellow at academic think tank UK in a Changing Europe and professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London.We’ll tell you what’s true.

But it is.\u0026nbspThe Access to Cash Review\u0026nbspwas put together by an independent panel of financial experts with the work funded by, but independent of, Link, which operates the UK’s network of cash machines.It’s authoritative, raises some important points, and also (crucially) floats some ideas for tackling them.\u0026nbspUK’s cash system in danger of ‘collapse’, leaving millions strugglingOne in five Brits have a ‘side hustle’ to make extra cash, says studyUK companies hoarding cash ahead of Brexit, new data showsThe reason why it’s a Brexit issue is this: will any of those points get the attention they deserve paid to them by a crisis-wracked government focused on just that one thing?\u0026nbspThe rapid decline in the use of cash ought to be an issue for the Treasury, which should be well aware of it. The issue has also been raised by the Payment Systems Regulator (repeatedly)\u0026nbspthe Financial Conduct Authority, which considered access to bank branches and ATMs in its Financial Lives of Consumers last year\u0026nbspand a variety of other organisations.\u0026nbspSome of the brighter sparks in the civil service congregate around Number 11 Downing Street, and they will doubtless be cognisant of the fact that the inability to use cash will pose a serious a problem for some groups the poor, the elderly, those living in rural areas where broadband connections are lousy, hampering the use of recent technological innovations.\u0026nbspThe problem is that the crisis is a looming one. There is still time before it becomes full blown. Given that the government’s time horizon currently doesn’t extend much beyond getting through the day without yet another disaster of its own making crashing down on its, and our, heads, it will likely feel that this is one of the many issues that can wait.\u0026nbspNo one has the faintest idea what’s happening with Brexit, businesses are screaming, and the economy is wilting. That’s before one considers the impact of a no-deal cliff edge and the fact that it could still happen, either by accident or the design of the extremists or the allies of extremists whom Chancellor Philip Hammond sits around the cabinet table with.\u0026nbspThat’s what the Treasury is focused upon, and it doesn’t have much choice.\u0026nbspEverything else is on the back burner.\u0026nbspSo you can forget consideration of the\u0026nbspreport’s\u0026nbspsuggested solutions\u0026nbsprequiring that essential services provided by utilities and councils allow for cash payments, having the banks create a body that would step in if rural communities run short, among other things.

Trouble is he doesn’t want the job.\u0026nbspThe company delivered a 44 per cent rise in sales in 2018, while pre tax profits came in at £102m against a £76m loss last time. Its preferred measure for earnings (underlying EBITDA) showed a rather more modest improvement of 6 per cent to £174m. But that was still more than handy given that this is a fast growing business facing considerable competitive pressure, notably from the likes of Deliveroo and Uber Eats, that’s investing heavily in what it does.\u0026nbspDuffy has also been credited with an improvement in margins, despite that competition, and while the shares fell today, they’ve been run up strongly over the past few weeks, so don\u0027t read too much into that.\u0026nbspJust Eat pledges to remove all restaurants with zero hygiene ratingRestaurants on Just Eat giving ‘life-threatening allergen information’The company’s acting boss is even confident that he can make money from offering a delivery service. As well as matching customers to takeaways, which handle their own deliveries, Just Eat wants to grab a bigger slice of that marketplace.\u0026nbspAs such, it’s muscling in on its rivals’ territory, working with branded restaurants to deliver food.\u0026nbspMaking money from doing that is not easy. But Duffy reckons the company can do it all the same, promising profits from Canada this year, and Australia and the UK further down the line.\u0026nbspThat’d be quite the trick.\u0026nbspDespite its achievements, however, the company finds itself in the cross hairs\u0026nbspof a US activist investor, in the form of Cat Rock. It thinks Just Eat should pursue a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway (in which Cat also holds shares) and give control of the combined business to the latter’s CEO Jitse Groen. Who\u0027s not much keen on the idea.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspActivists would be a good thing if they addressed corporate governance issues, silly pay packages for executives, and the like and sometimes they can have a positive impact on under performing businesses with bad bosses and boards.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.High-end slipper retailer Mahabis has gone into administration. 2 Jan 2019Coca-Cola has paid £3.9bn for Costa Coffee.

In its latest economic outlook, the OECD said growth is expected to remain weak in the UK for the foreseeable future. Based on a smooth Brexit and a transition period lasting until the end of 2020, the OECD has forecast GDP growth of below 1 per cent in the next two years. However, a no-deal Brexit would reduce GDP by around 2 per cent in the UK for the next two years. The OECD said: “The effects could be stronger still if a lack of adequate border infrastructure and a loss of access to EU trade arrangements with third countries were to cause serious bottlenecks in integrated cross-border supply chains.”The group said the costs associated with a cliff-edge departure from the EU could be magnified by a further decline in business and financial market confidence and disruption in financial markets.

Meanwhile, the think tank said the impact of trade arrangements on WTO terms would vary across the EU, with smaller countries like Ireland, the Netherlands and Denmark “relatively exposed”. The biggest impact would be felt in the agriculture, machinery and equipment sectors. The OECD’s predictions echo previous warnings from the Bank of England, which last year said a no deal could plunge the UK into a larger recession that the global financial crisis 10 years ago if a no-deal Brexit goes ahead. Based on the bank’s worst case scenario modelling, the UK economy would contract by 8 per cent, house prices would fall by a third, unemployment would spike to 7.5 per cent, interest rates would shoot up to 5.5 per cent and the value of the pound would fall to below $1.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The average price of a house rose to £236,800 in the three months to February, up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period one year prior. This is a marked contrast with the 3 per cent month-on-month decline recorded in January. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “The shortage of houses for sale will certainly be playing a role in supporting prices. “People are still facing challenges in raising a deposit which means we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being. However, the number of sales in January was right on the five year average and, at over 100,000 for the fifth consecutive month, the overall resilience of the market is still evident.”Lucy Pendleton, founder of estate agents James Pendleton, said: “This market is rattling around like a ricocheting bullet. It’s an incredibly unusual shift, even for monthly prices which are known to be more volatile.

If accepted this would have made the property he most expensive single home ever to be sold in Britain. It was originally listed with an asking price of £300 million –more than double the price of the UK’s second most expensive home.“At first glance this monthly surge could be a bout of pre-Brexit confidence but nothing has changed. We have as much certainty over Britain’s exit from the EU as we did a year ago. “The more likely answer is that in key areas low supply is squeezing those buyers who have a need, rather than just a desire, to move and just can’t put it off any longer.”Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the volatility shown in the latest figures provoked “little confidence in Halifax’s index as a reliable indicator of the housing market”. “Its extreme volatility… undermines its validity,” he added. “Like others, the index is seasonally adjusted, but it uses an outdated methodology which potentially is contributing to its excessive volatility. All other indicators suggest that house prices essentially are on a flat trend.”UK house price growth grinds to halt as Brexit uncertainty bitesBrexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023Mr Tombs said: “The support to house prices from the combination of faster growth in nominal wages and extremely low unemployment is being offset, for now, by anxiety about Brexit. The housing market likely will revive for a short period if, as we still expect, MPs sign off a Brexit deal by the summer. But a Brexit deal also will give the green light to the MPC to push through further increases in bank rate. “With loan-to-income ratios at a record high, even modest increases in mortgage rates will greatly dampen house price growth. As a result, we still expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5 per cent over the course of 2019.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nearly 200 families are in limbo waiting to hear where their child will be for the start of the\u0026nbspautumn term.So why are more children missing out on places at their preferred schools? Quite simply, there are more pupils entering secondary school than in previous years, making the competition tougher.And in some cities, the provision of school places is failing to keep up with a\u0026nbsppopulation bulge which is now moving into secondary education. Often, more housing is approved before a new school has opened up, making matters worse.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police and bomb disposal services outside the University of Glasgow after the building was evacuated when a suspect package was found in the mailroomPolice officers secure the scene where a suspicious package was found near Waterloo railway station.

Government forecasts show that secondary school pupil numbers will rise by 15 per cent over a nine-year period. The population is expected to peak at 3.3m in 2027 –\u0026nbsp418,000 more than in 2018.But not all parts of the country will experience a shortage of school places. A child’s chance of winning a place at their preferred school\u0026nbspvaries significantly depending on where they live.The problem appears to be most acute in London and its surrounding counties, as well as other cities with significant population growth.Parents to protest after children left without any school placesA recent survey suggests that only 6 per cent of children in Somerset did not get their first choice secondary school, compared to more than a third in London. And more than 700 children were left with no secondary school place at all in the capital last week.All this has angered\u0026nbspparents, who say multiple warnings were made about the baby boom and its impact on places.For a number of years, councils, schools and unions have spoken up about a potential shortage of secondary places. And yet in some areas, not enough forward planning appears to have taken place. \u0026nbspThe government says it\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspincreased the number of free schools to ensure there are enough places, but these are not always in the right areas. And some may not have not opened in time.Moreover, councils, who are responsible for making sure there are enough places, are not able to create schools. They also cannot force academies and free schools to expand to take more pupils.And it can be difficult to encourage a school to expand if they lack the space and resources to do so.State schools are struggling to pay for repairs to their existing buildings and class sizes have been rising amid squeezed budgets.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspMowlem\u0026nbspwas instrumental in the negotiations which led to the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

It shows that, surprisingly, the atmosphere is evenly mixed in a way they had not expected.Any explanation for this has to be unorthodox, Stevenson said.It could be that the strange atmosphere is formed by weather events that are concentrating large amounts of ice, liquids and gas across the atmosphere. But it is still not clear.Other instruments on Juno have sent back strange data about its gravitational and magnetic properties. Jupiter seems to have unexplained spots where the magnetic field is either unusually high or low, and it is very different across the northern and southern hemisphere.It\u0027s unlike anything we have seen before, Stevenson said.Scientists also found from gravity data that inside Jupiter – which is at least 90 per cent hydrogen and helium – there are also much heavier elements, which amount to more than 10 times the mass of Earth. But they are not squashed into one core and are instead mixed in with the hydrogen above, which is found in the form of a metallic liquid.And the data also gave new information about the outer parts of both planets. The amount of heavier elements there is uncertain, but the outer layers are playing much more of a role in the magnetic field than the scientists had expected.Researchers now hope to mimic their pressures and temperatures on Earth, in an attempt to understand what is happening on the planets themselves.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There were ideas, but there were never, until now - maybe there will be today because I know talks are going on in Brussels - but we are waiting for a sustainable proposal.”Earlier in the week Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar told the Irish parliament the UK had proposed no actual legal text for the EU side to consider.After his latest meeting Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said on Wednesday: “I cant reveal the discussions, they are private and confidential discussions but we are into the meat of the matter, both sides have exchanged robust, strong views and we are now facing the real discussions.”A leaked diplomatic note from the EU side suggests the UK has proposed two possible changes to the controversial policy.\u0026nbspThe note, first reported by BuzzFeed News, includes plans for an arbitration panel that would allow the backstop to end if one side or another was not judged to have taken “reasonable” steps to find alternatives to it.\u0026nbspThe second proposal is that of a “mini-backstop” which would limit regulatory alignment only to areas crucial to avoiding infrastructure on the Irish border.EU officials are said to have rejected both these plans because they believe they would undermine the certainty of the backstop preventing a hard border in Ireland.Talks are said to be somewhat ill-tempered, with EU officials resenting yet another change of interlocutor on the UK side, following the departures of David Davis and Dominic Raab, a switch from visits by Ollie Robbins and the eclipsing of Stephen Barclay by Geoffrey Cox. Michel Barnier and Sabine Weyand have remained the EU\u0027s main negotiators throughout the process.Theresa May is expected to visit Brussels herself either this weekend or on Monday, if there has been enough progress to produce some kind of concession.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentHer visit would come one day ahead of the second planned meaningful vote on her deal, where the Government hopes to overturn MPs’ first decision to reject the plan. If her deal is rejected MPs are then on Wednesday scheduled to vote on a no-deal, and on Thursday whether Article 50 should be extended.Brexiteer MPs\u0026nbspdo not like the backstop becuase they fear it will trap the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU. The DUP, on whom Theresa May relies for a majority, do not like it because it treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. The UK government agreed to the plan but then said it would renegotiate it after pressure from Tory MPs. The EU says the policy is necessary to prevent a hard border in Ireland and preserve the peace process.We’ll tell you what’s true.

that takes time, he told the Today programme.What you have to do is redirect your resources, change your priorities, to deal with the immediate priority issue.The chancellor argued that securing a Brexit deal would allow him to turn on the spending taps, as the government scrambles to win support from MPs\u0026nbspahead of the so-called meaningful vote on Tuesday.He said: If we get the right Brexit deal done, and a smooth exit from the European Union so that we can release the money that we\u0027ve set aside to deal with the possible disruption of a no-deal exit, then that will give us more money still that we can put into public services over the next three years.If MPs reject the deal, Mr Hammond argued it was\u0026nbsplikely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article 50 procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain.He added: For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run risk of us moving away from their preferred course of action if we don\u0027t get this deal through on Tuesday.If the deal is voted down, the prime minister has promised to allow the Commons a vote on whether to veto a no-deal exit on Wednesday, and a further vote on the prospect of a short delay to Brexit the following day.Mr Hammond refused to be drawn on how he would vote, amid fierce speculation on whether the prime minister would allow her cabinet to have a free vote to avoid resignations.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentI\u0027m not going to speculate about something that hasn\u0027t happened and I don\u0027t think will happen because I think the government is very clear where the will of parliament is on this, he told Today.Parliament will vote not to leave the European Union without a deal next Wednesday, I have a high degree of confidence about that.But we do need to have clear confirmation.

I want to apologise. I am profoundly sorry for the offence and hurt that my words have caused. The language was wrong and even though this was not my intention, it was deeply insensitive to many of those who lost loved ones.I know from those families that I have met personally just how raw their pain is and I completely understand why they want to see justice properly delivered. I share that aim and that is why I launched the public consultation on addressing the legacy of the Troubles.My position and the position of this government is clear. We believe fundamentally in the rule of law. Where there is any evidence of wrongdoing this should be pursued without fear or favour whoever the perpetrators might be. That is a principle that underpins our approach to dealing with legacy issues and it is one from which we will not depart.Andrea Leadsom confirms to MPs that a second meaningful vote on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal will be held on Tuesday.\u0026nbspShe says that in the deeply regrettable event\u0026nbspthat MPs reject the deal, she will make a further business statement in order to allow for votes on whether to pursue no-deal or extend Article 50.Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who has suffered antisemitic abuse, has welcomed the EHRC\u0027s decision to look into allegations that the\u0026nbspparty has discriminated against Jewish people.\u0026nbspShe said:This is a devastating indictment on the Labour Party. Decent members will be horrified that we have got into this position.However, after three years of appalling incidents of antisemitism, from a small number of racists within our ranks which the leadership failed to tackle, this is a necessary step.I welcome the EHRC intervention but today is another dark day in the history of our party which could and should have been avoided if concerns raised had been heeded last year.Labour has responded to the\u0026nbspEHRC\u0027s announcement that it is looking into whether the party discriminated against people based on their ethnicity and religious beliefs.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA Labour spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be cooperating fully with the EHRC.\u0026nbspLabour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations.\u0026nbspAntisemitism complaints received since April 2018 relate to about 0.1 per cent\u0026nbspof our membership, but one antisemite in our party is one too many.

We are discussing texts with the European Union.\u0026nbspI am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last 48 hours that the proposals are not clear. They are as clear as day and we are continuing to discuss them.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAnswering questions from MPs in the Commons, Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general, says he has had focused, detailed, and careful discussions with the EU and adds: We continue to seek legally-binding changes to the backstop which ensure that it cannot be indefinite.\u0026nbspNegotiations with Brussels will be resumed shortly, he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokesperson for the Equalities and Human Rights Commission said:\u0026nbsp“We believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs. Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond.”BREAKING: The Equalities and Human Rights Commission says is believes Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs\u0026nbspThere are reports swirling around this morning that the equalities watchdog could be on the verge of launching an inquiry into antisemitism in Labour.\u0026nbspJewish groups have previously handed files of complaints to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and are awaiting a formal response.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe\u0027ll of course keep an eye on this and bring you the latest as soon as it happens.Jeremy Corbyn met with Tory MPs Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles yesterday in a bid to forge a cross-party consensus on a softer Brexit deal that could win a majority in the Commons.\u0026nbspWriting in today\u0027s Daily Mirror, the Labour leader said he was\u0026nbspmore certain than ever that we can find a way to work across parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs.He said:I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children\u0027s future than a customs union.Labour respects the result of the referendum and a close economic relationship is the best Brexit compromise for both 17 million Leave voters and 16 million Remain voters.But we can\u0027t accept a damaging Tory Brexit or a no deal outcome, so we also support preparing for a public vote in case parliament is not able to achieve a sensible Brexit.We will do whatever we can to find a solution that can unite the country so, together, we can face down the real challenges and seize the opportunities in this moment of great change.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Not only that, but we should also be in a customs union with the EU, which is an even closer relationship than Norway’s.\u0026nbspThere is some overlap between their plan and the Labour Party’s policy, which is to keep Britain in a permanent customs union with the EU. So it is significant that Jeremy Corbyn is holding talks with Boles and Letwin.\u0026nbspSome MPs are thinking ahead to Tuesday next week, and asking what will happen if the prime minister’s deal, possibly with a legal codicil attached (on the Irish border question), is voted down again.They wonder if there might be a cross-party majority in the House of Commons for a softer Brexit based on a compromise between Labour policy and the Boles-Letwin plan.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.You can see how the parliamentary arithmetic might work. At the moment, Theresa May cannot get her deal through because neither hard-Brexit Tory MPs nor soft-Brexit Labour MPs will vote for it.\u0026nbspIf she made her plan softer – that is, if she switched to proposing an even closer economic relationship with the EU after we have left – maybe the vast majority of Labour MPs would vote for it. This might more than compensate for the number of Tory MPs she would lose off the other end of the seesaw, and might give her the Commons majority she needs.\u0026nbspOur Labour party can unite behind Corbyn\u0027s challenge to a Tory BrexitThere are obvious drawbacks to this cunning plan, which is why it hasn’t happened so far.One is that May would be left with a rump Tory party. She would probably be able to retain the support of only a minority of her MPs for such a deal – led by Amber Rudd and Philip Hammond in the cabinet and a large cohort of junior ministers, but a rather depleted contingent of backbenchers.\u0026nbspShe would be in a position mirroring that of Ramsay MacDonald, the Labour prime minister who led a government of mostly Conservative MPs after the economic crisis of 1931.\u0026nbspIf the PM’s deal is defeated on Tuesday the Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the European Union without a deal, but after that things become less clearAnother problem is Corbyn. Even if the compromise gave him everything he says Labour wants – a permanent customs union, protections for workers’ rights and so on – it would be hard to imagine him whipping his MPs to prop up a Tory prime minister, even one who was implementing a “Labour Brexit”.\u0026nbspAs it is, Theresa May’s Brexit deal is very close to what a Labour government would have negotiated.Indeed, there is no material difference between the withdrawal agreement that Corbyn says he wants and the one she presented to the Commons in January. The government and opposition disagree only about details of the long-term trade relationship with the EU that has to be negotiated after we leave.\u0026nbspA third problem is that Norway-plus is in effect EU membership without voting rights, and it would mean accepting the free movement of people – possibly with a few token restrictions that are claimed to be compatible with EU law.\u0026nbspBut who knows what could happen if the prime minister’s deal is defeated on Tuesday? The Commons would certainly vote the next day against leaving the EU without a deal, but after that things become less clear. MPs might then vote to postpone Brexit – or they might vote against that too.\u0026nbspEither way, it is possible that Norway-plus might be one of the options that comes into play. In which case, the extent of the common ground that Corbyn, Boles and Letwin found today could decide the nation’s future.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This means leaving the customs union and pursuing an independent trade policy.“The House of Commons has previously voted against a customs union with the EU and we will seek to have the Lords decision reversed when the Bill returns to the Commons.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The average price of a house rose to £236,800 in the three months to February, up 2.8 per cent compared to the same period one year prior. This is a marked contrast with the 3 per cent month-on-month decline recorded in January. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, said: “The shortage of houses for sale will certainly be playing a role in supporting prices. “People are still facing challenges in raising a deposit which means we continue to expect subdued price growth for the time being. However, the number of sales in January was right on the five year average and, at over 100,000 for the fifth consecutive month, the overall resilience of the market is still evident.”Lucy Pendleton, founder of estate agents James Pendleton, said: “This market is rattling around like a ricocheting bullet. It’s an incredibly unusual shift, even for monthly prices which are known to be more volatile.

If accepted this would have made the property he most expensive single home ever to be sold in Britain. It was originally listed with an asking price of £300 million –more than double the price of the UK’s second most expensive home.“At first glance this monthly surge could be a bout of pre-Brexit confidence but nothing has changed. We have as much certainty over Britain’s exit from the EU as we did a year ago. “The more likely answer is that in key areas low supply is squeezing those buyers who have a need, rather than just a desire, to move and just can’t put it off any longer.”Meanwhile, Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said the volatility shown in the latest figures provoked “little confidence in Halifax’s index as a reliable indicator of the housing market”. “Its extreme volatility… undermines its validity,” he added. “Like others, the index is seasonally adjusted, but it uses an outdated methodology which potentially is contributing to its excessive volatility. All other indicators suggest that house prices essentially are on a flat trend.”UK house price growth grinds to halt as Brexit uncertainty bitesBrexit uncertainty will push rents up faster than house prices by 2023Mr Tombs said: “The support to house prices from the combination of faster growth in nominal wages and extremely low unemployment is being offset, for now, by anxiety about Brexit. The housing market likely will revive for a short period if, as we still expect, MPs sign off a Brexit deal by the summer. But a Brexit deal also will give the green light to the MPC to push through further increases in bank rate. “With loan-to-income ratios at a record high, even modest increases in mortgage rates will greatly dampen house price growth. As a result, we still expect the official measure of house prices to rise by just 1.5 per cent over the course of 2019.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Passengers reported that officials were asking more questions than normal at passport control, and security checks on bags were also taking longer than normal.“Customs officers are strictly applying the rules and reinforcing controls,” David-Olivier Caron, an official from the CFDT trade union, said.May could force ministers to vote for no-deal Brexit, Fox saysWorkers are demanding more staff to help them after Brexit, as well as better overnight pay and a danger allowance ahead of the UK’s departure, which on paper is set to happen on 29 March.Philippe Bollengier from the CGT union added: “There will be stronger controls. Today you have a demonstration of what is going to happen.”A spokesperson for Eurostar said: “Eurostar trains departing Paris today are subject to delays of up to 60 minutes.\u0026nbsp“This is due to passport and security checks, carried out by French customs officers, taking longer than usual.

Only a blank so blank that it screams.”But it was “two-dinners” Watson, before his dramatic weight loss, whose “curry house conspiracy” with Gordon Brown toppled triple election-winner Tony Blair.It was Watson who was forced to apologise after using Parliamentary privilege to smear dead Tory Leon Brittan with “evil” child sex slurs.And it is Watson who aims to wreck free speech by gagging the Press.Jew-baiting Marxist Jeremy Corbyn seems a saint by comparison.His bleak imagery will come as no surprise in Westminster, but it explains the tidal wave of ministers who walked out of her Cabinet in exasperation.To her shame, Amber Rudd and her fellow Ruddites lacked the courage to follow suit last week. Instead, they simply destroyed any last chance of using No Deal as a negotiating card.Ms Rudd once saw herself as a potential Tory leader or a “king maker” to Boris Johnson or Michael Gove.“After last week, any association with Amber would be the kiss of death not just in Westminster, but with the party at large,” said a Tory MP.“She is poison. Everyone wants to leave on March  — other than those who don’t want to leave at all.”That prospect now relies on silver-tongued Geoffrey Cox wangling an escape clause on the Northern Ireland backstop — dubbed “Cox’s codpiece”.The Attorney-General needs to sell his formula not just to Theresa May, but to fellow Leavers — including eagle-eyed veteran eurosceptic Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee.If they approve, Mrs May might clinch Brexit as promised this month.And then navigate her way to a dignied and honourable Therexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV. It’s overwhelming.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In the northern hemisphere, the spring equinox always falls in what month ”Anne: “December.”Ben Shephard: “The Ace Of Spades was a UK Top Ten hit in  for which hard-rock band ”Ang: “N-Dubz.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What McVitie’s chocolate biscuit is named after a flightless bird ”Andy: “Dodo.”Ben Shephard: “In the  film The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which British actor starred as Doctor Frank N Furter ”Tracey: “Sir Anthony Hopkins.”YOU think Theresa May’s got a job on her hands   Spare a thought for the staff on E’s Celebs Go Dating, where they’ve signed up Kerry Katona for the new series. ’Cos that really is the TV equivalent of trying to shove a boulder up Kilimanjaro.Hiring a woman who introduces herself to every potential suitor by announcing: “I’ve got five kids and three ex-husbands, but don’t let that put you off” and describes herself as a “blue-tick shag”, which I thought had wiped out nearly every sheep in West Glamorgan back in .In fairness to Kerry, it does also hint at a level of fame that’s way above the rest of the agency’s clients, who include the thoroughly obnoxious Che Healey, from Hollyoaks, Made In Cha manchild Sam Thompson, Pete Wicks off Towie and someone called David Potts, who could be Mark “The Beast” Labbett’s Chase stunt double, judging by the size of him.None of them, of course, will find anything approaching love on a show where they now boast an impressive  per cent failure rate across six series. What continues to stop it being the most pointless exercise in TV history, though, is the narrator Rob Beckett, who’s fantastically dismissive about everyone and everything involved with Celebs Go Dating.So when David finally reveals “I’m a club rep”, he mutters: “I was thinking either that or a jockey,” and when Kerry reminds yet another person, “I used to be in a girlband,” Rob adds: “Before realising her dream of flogging frozen prawn rings.”In the brutal and relentless process, he’s somehow turned this epic non-event into one of television’s funniest shows, and I just wish the industry could come up with a better reward for him than All Together Now.The Real Marigold On Tour, Paul Nicholas: “There is humour in everything.” See Martin Clunes’ sitcom Warren for proof there really isn’t.BEST news of the TV week is that Channel ’s admirably un-PC The Bachelor has ed to our screens after a seven-year hiatus.Prize this time is a civilian called Alex, who was “bullied at school” , found salvation in the gym and now spends his days running along beaches, like a right dobber.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

It’s like a runaway horse.“Don’t watch it go, or let others be the ones to tame it.“The current lot are still in the stable, events have overtaken them and they cannot catch that horse now.”He will add: “We must tame it – our generation. It’s time for a new generation to take over and govern dferently”.Blasting today’s political leaders as “a profession of insincerity”, Mr Mercer will also insist all MPs must be more honest and upfront with voters to win back their trust.Turning on some older Tories, Mr Mercer - tipped as a future Tory leader – will go on: “I love many of my colleagues dearly, but we’ve selected too many of the wrong people over the last twenty years.“We must be courageous enough to hold a mirror up to ourselves”.Speaking at an event organised by the think tank Onward, Mr Mercer will also call for the Tories toto a more compassionate brand of One Nation politics after two years of bitter feuding over Brexit.Showing empathy is the key to reclaiming millions of centre ground voters who currently feel politically homeless, he will argue.The Plymouth Moor View MP will insist Tory MPs must “walk in people’s shoes, govern with compassion as well as fiscal competence, look for common ground, reject the extremes, and ditch the spin”.He will added: “There is a country out there, full of hope, full of optimism, desperately looking for something to vote for.“We are not a hard left country – people don’t want the socialism of Jeremy Corbyn. They want a modern, centre-right values led party.“If we do that, we’ll reach out to plenty of people who feel politically homeless. We’ll connect. We’ll build a movement, not a party.”Mr Mercer will also name-check a series of younger Tory MPs as the party’s future in his speech.He will champion two campaigners for causes from more ordinary backgrounds, AE nurse Maria Caulfield and former postman Scott Mann.And he also heaps praise on Tracey Crouch, who resigned as Sports Minister to force through curbs on fixed odds betting terminals, as well as Cabinet Office minister and ex-No aide Oliver Dowden.Mr Mercer’s broadside heaps yet more pressure on Mrs May to set her departure date for later this year once Brexit has taken place.The PM was forced to promise she would stand down before the  general election in December to fend off a bid by angry Brexiteer Tories to oust her.But despite her own MPs growing frustrations with her, Mrs May last week signalled she wants to stay on in No for some time yet to deliver on her domestic agenda.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mr Hammond said: The Labour Party has been talking for a long time about the idea of a customs union grafted onto the Prime Ministers deal.Those of my colleagues who feel very strongly against that proposal need to think very very hard about the implications of voting against the Prime Minister’s deal next Tuesday. Because we will then be in unknown territory where a consensus will then have to be forged across the House of Commons. And that will inevitably mean compromises being made.  Last night the Brexit Department announced the UK and EU agreed to consider a joint work stream to consider alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop. But its not the alternative many hope for. It would only come up with this alternative after March , once a deal has been signed off.  The EU is said to be willing to work through the weekend. But it needs something to work with and it claims the ball is in Britains court. A grim diplomatic note from the EU was leaked to BuzzFeed which described a meeting to discuss the UKs plans as negative - and claimed Britain was seeking a “legal solution to a political problem.” Furious Attorney General GeoffreyCox today admitted talks with the EU will almost certainly continue through the weekend - but said he was surprised at reports of insanity. He also bizarrely boasted about the contents of his underpants, saying his plan has come to be called Coxs codpiece. What Im concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order, he added.  The Attorney General told MPs: We are discussing detailed, coherent, careful proposals. I am surprised to hear the comments that have emerged over the last  hours that the proposals are not clear. They are as clear as day and we are continuing to discuss them.He added: We have been engaging in focused, detailed and careful discussions with the Union and we continue to seek legally-binding changes to the backstop which ensure that it cannot be indefinite. These discussions will be resumed shortly.   Alternatives were said to include widening the scope of an arbitration  on whether the UK can quit the backstop, or a watered-down version of the original plan. At the very latest the final agreement needs to be made by around dawn on Monday, in time to be put to MPs in a motion on Monday afternoon before Tuesdays vote. If Tuesdays vote fails, there will be a vote on Wednesday on whether to proceed with No Deal. If No Deal is blocked, there will be a vote on Thursday on whether to delay Brexit. But Jeremy Corbyn could throw a spanner in the works by stitching up an amendment with Tory MPs to push for a customs union. That could allow a softer Brexit but anger Labour MPs, who thought theyd finally persuaded the leader the throw his weight behind a second referendum. Writing in todays Mirror, MrCorbynsuggested MPs were coming round to the idea of a soft Brexit. He said he was more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across Parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs.   One worried minister told the Sun: “If we lose on Tuesday, absolutely everything is going to be s***. I cannot see how we go forward with whatever softer Brexit that gets imposed on us without the party splitting in two. It will be a complete disaster.” Meanwhile, French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau restated that the -page Brexit deal cannot be reopened, and insisted the controversial Irish backstop was a last resort solution. She told BBC Radio s Today programme the deal was the best possible solution, and said: We cannot reopen this negotiation on the Withdrawal Agreement because it is balanced... We dont like the backstop, we dont want to have to implement it, andwe have to, we dont want to stay in the backstop.

This demands we change the economy’s rules and claim a better future for the many, not the few. Another world really could be possible. But we are stuck. I feel it and I speak to people right across our country, who feel it too. Were stuck in the mess the government has made of Brexit. It is dragging our communities down, whether they voted leave or remain, and driving deep ision. It’s time we raised our sights from this  ide and moved beyond Brexit to deal with the real pressures facing people. Over a million elderly people are not getting the care they deserve. Take home pay has barely risen since the financial crisis and household debt is growing six times faster than wages.   We are experiencing a surge of violent crime on our streets, with fatal stabbings at their highest levels since records began. Our schools are sending begging letters to parents and even closing early on Fridays because they can’t afford staff and supplies. Last month, thousands of school children demonstrating in towns and cities across our country and biblical scenes of wildfires in England, Wales and Scotland on the hottest February day on record should have shamed us all into immediate and radical action on climate change. Instead, the issue barely registers in Westminster.   Getting Brexit right is vital but it can’t block out everything . That’s why I am holding meetings with business groups, trade unions and senior MPs from across Parliament to try to deliver a majority in the House of Commons for a close economic relationship with the EU, so we can move beyond Brexit. On Tuesday, I met the five biggest organisations that represent Britain’s businesses, large and small. They want what Labour wants, the uncertainty to end and a sensible deal to be struck.   Yesterday, I saw senior Labour and Conservative MPs to discuss a close economic relationship with the EU, which would help protect jobs like those of the Honda workers in Swindon, some of whom I also met. I left both meetings more certain than ever that we can find a way to work across parliament to force the government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs and more determined to achieve it. I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children’s future than a customs union.   Labour respects the result of the referendum and a close economic relationship is the best Brexit compromise for both  million leave voters and  million remain voters. But we can’t accept a damaging Tory Brexit or a no deal outcome, so we also support preparing for a public vote in case parliament is not able to achieve a sensible Brexit. We will do whatever we can to find a solution that can unite the country so, together, we can face down the real challenges and seize the opportunities in this moment of great change.

British-made small arms, surveillance and border security equipment were on show for overseas governments. Attendees included Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all of whom have been criticised for their police forces’ heavy handed tactics.

Andrew Smith of Campaign against the Arms Trade said: “Many of those in attendance have a history of torturing and executing journalists and activists. “By arming and supporting them, the UK Government is making itself complicit in these abuses. “Events like this only strengthen the UKs links to dictatorships and entrench its role as a global arms dealer. They undermine the Governments claims to be promoting human rights and strengthen the position of repressive regimes.”   In his speech, Dr Fox said: “This sector plays a vital role in the UK’s prosperity: totalling some pound. billion of our exports - and it continues to grow.” A Government spokesperson said: “The Government is proud to support British industry and to do all it can to help keep British people and British interests safe both in the UK and overseas.” "},{"url":null,"title":"you renew your passport friday","story":"NewsYou may have to renew your passport by this Friday - or be barred from EuropeTravellers could fall foul of rules for entering countries in the Schengen zone such as France, Spain and ItalyShareCommentsByOliver Milne:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe warning comes from consumer rights experts Which  \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe deadline to renew your passportyou are planning to travel in Europe could be as soon as this Friday - a consumer rights group has claimed.

Former goalkeeper Jade Almond was originally hospitalised in July last year after falling back off a chair and smacking her head. The accident left the -year-old struggling to concentrate properly, suffering from uncontrollable shakes, and unable to walk. Doctors diagnosed her with al neurological disorder , which required intensive, privately-funded physio treatment. And after seven gruelling months of pound, crowd-funded physio, Jade was incredibly able to walk, run and dance again. She was discharged on February  this year, with footage from that day showing the teenager excitedly running up stairs.  She was also filmed jogging on a treadmill for the first time in seven months as she marked the end of her treatment. But in a cruel twist of fate, Jade, from Abram, Greater Manchester, was involved in a car crash on the M on her way home the same day. The former Wigan Athletic Ladies youth team goalkeeper was joined by mum Michelle Almond, sister Josie and two pals at the time. They claim the other cars driver was leaning over and trying to pick up popcorn from the vehicles floor when she ploughed into them. The impact of the crash has left Jade bed bound with the strength of a newborn baby, partially paralysed and unable to sit up unaided. The courageous teen said: Its heartbreaking being in this position and knowing all that hard work has been undone.  I was pretty much back to normal - able to run, dance and play football again - I was  per cent there and only had a bit of a tremor in my leg. After the car crash its worse than its ever been as now its affecting my whole body. During the crash, the other car allegedly ploughed into the groups vehicle, causing Jade to bang her head twice. She first realised there was a problem when she was unable to move her right arm to comfort her friend. Her legs then gave way as she tried to get out of the car. She recalled: On the day I was discharged from Sheffield we were all so happy. That night I had a commercial and street dance class and was so excited to go for the first time in ages.  We had music on in the car, were singing along and just having a really good time. I was talking to my friend when the crash happened and was facing left, I flew forward and banged my head and then again when we stopped. I first noticed that the back of my friends head was bleeding. I went to hug her because she was so upset and my hand wouldnt move, I was so confused. My left arm was moving but when I tried to move my right arm it was just stuck. I tried to stand up getting out of the car and I fell to the floor, my mum had to catch me. She added: In hospital I was just sitting there and couldnt move, my mum was tapping my leg but I couldnt feel anything at all. I was so scared and did panic because Id never had those symptoms before. I had an instinct it was an FND relapse, Id never had those symptoms before so it was a huge shock.  You couldnt make it up that on the day I left physio this happened. It was heartbreaking knowing all the hard work had been undone. Jade was initially treated at Salford Royal Hospital before being transferred to the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan. Footage shows how she is unable to sit up unaided. Instead, she is forced to rely on mum Michelle to prop her up. Jade said: From the elbow down on my right arm is paralysed, I cant move or feel it at all. Both my legs are really numb and weak and when I try to stand on them they just collapse. My sitting balance has completely gone - my core and my neck are really weak - and I cant sit straight. It seems like Ive lost all my strength, its like Ive only got the strength of a baby.  Even when Im lying down I have to have pillows under me or I fall to that right side. Its so frustrating not being able to move, all I want to do is get up and back to where I was or at least move instead of just lying in a bed all day. The family have already spent pound, on Jades original treatment. Now, they are raising more funds through GoFundMe to help cover the cost of further treatment needed after the crash. Jade said: Im desperate to get back to physio because weve learnt that intensive rehab is the way forward for me. Its what I need but the only place that provides it is expensive, weve got the proof it works but its hard to get back to that. We didnt put up a GoFundMe at first because we didnt want to ask for money. We didnt want to feel like we were begging for money - it felt wrong.  It took a few months to pluck up the courage to put one together but when we did we got pound in a few hours. We were shocked at the number of people wanting to help. The number of people wanting to help has been amazing. Treatment is expensive but its worth every penny - you cant put a price on it.She added: The dream is to be able to go back to football, dancing and acting - I just want a normal le back. Former NHS worker and mum Michelle, , said: Its heartbreaking seeing what shes going through now after everything. It was devastating seeing her go from a perfectly healthy girl and then go through what she did. Her le was on hold for those seven months as she couldnt go to college or do the things she loved such as football, acting and dancing.  Seeing her be able to run up stairs for the first time since it happened, go for a jog and dance again last month was absolutely amazing - it was the best feeling. [On the day of the crash] traffic had gone to a complete standstill. The woman behind me was apparently picking up popcorn off the floor and careered into the back of us at what felt like -mph. Jade was in the back and had direct impact, it was awful. For this to happen is heartbreaking but Jade has been so positive about it as shes seen she can improve.

And yesterday, he joined colleagues from Yorkshire, the North East, Kent and Nottinghamshire to deliver the ,-name document to Downing Street, demanding back the cash that so many have been “robbed” of. Ken, who worked at Oakdale Colliery, said: “We’ve had tremendous support but it’s been shocking to discover even miners themselves are oblivious to the depths of this betrayal. “Their communities have been destroyed and they’ve been left to scrape by on a pittance while the Government uses their pension billions as a slush fund to dip into at will. “Gathering signatures, I spoke to one widow who gets pound. a week.

Paul Stevey was an electrician at Manchester’s Agecroft Colliery and is now living in a caravan on a pension of just pound a week. The -year-old, of Allonby, Cumbria, said: “I sold my home six years ago and the caravan was meant to be a stop-gap while I found something smaller. But the cost of living ate into my savings and now I can’t afford to buy a home.

It can revolutionise how a company works in so many areas, from more efficient front line production to improved data analysis. But with technological advances moving at a faster rate than human skills, it is vital for small and medium sized businesses to keep up. So to help, Yorkshire Bank’s Group Business Banking Director, Gavin Opperman, is here to answer your questions... Q How can small businesses reduce costs associated with new technology  A Every small business needs technology to support them to make their business more efficient. Technology is moving faster than human skills are, which is why it is necessary for small businesses to weigh up exactly what piece of technology they want to own, its longevity and whether its development can be outsourced. Q Is understanding the latest technology essential for all small businesses  A Most small businesses will need to adopt some level of technology to make their business run efficiently. However,small businesses get caught up in the technology race too much they can move away from their core business. Remember to find a balance between what is needed and how to make the businessoptimally. Q What technology should small businesses be looking out for  A Every small business is dferent. There’s a number of exhibitions that they can attend to see what technology is most suited to them. Small businesses should look for options that will give them long-term sustainability at an economical rate and ultimately make their business more efficient. Q Many small businesses are struggling with the complexity of new technology – how can they simply the concept  A At Yorkshire Bank, we strive to bring industry experts and like-minded people together. Many of the sectors or businesses are prepared to share their knowledge to others in the industry. It is about finding the right technology to fit your business, and one that is suitable over a long period. Q How can small businesses keep up to date with the latest products and services available  A When it comes to technology, Yorkshire Bank provides a relationship model. We as bankers aren’t there as technology experts, but what we can do is share best practice. We can introduce small businesses to experts in our portfolio who can advise on the latest products and services available. Q Many small businesses are hindered by time and internal resources – how can they still embrace new technology  A The biggest challenge Yorkshire Bank has identied with small businesses is the skills shortage, which puts pressure on internal resources. A lot of universities are developing skills in technology, but it’s how small businesses can retain the talent within that. The aim would be to keep the intellectual property within \u2028the region, so small businesses can embrace new technology without added time or training.Find out more about a business bank that works for you at YBonline business"},{"url":null,"title":"queen sends first instagram post","story":"NewsThe Queen sends her first Instagram post from Londons Science MuseumThe -year-old monarch posted on Instagram about her visit to the Science Museum in London - where she also wrote her first tweet five years agoShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsQueen Elizabeth II arrives at The Science Museum this morning \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailQueen Elizabeth has sent her first ever Instagram post while visiting the Science Museum in London.The -year-old monarch is now an Instagram influencer with her post about Prince Albert and Queen Victoria, her great-great-grandparents.In , at the same place, she sent the first royal tweet under own name.

She was  but had the mental age of a baby and after thorough examinations, experts said she demonstrated the most severe case of child abuse on record. The teenager was mute and could not chew so instead held food in her mouth until saliva broke it down. Regardless of where she was she constantly spat, snfing and blowing her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. Genie occasionally touched herself intimately without caring who was near and, despite getting upset and angry, she never cried. The -year-old showed understanding of only her own name and two phrases - stop it and no more. She was abnormally pale, grossly malnourished and the lead her father kept her on had caused a thick, bruised callus to form on her backside.   The case of Genie the feral child became known to the world as one of the most horric examples of child abuse and neglect ever uncovered in the United States. From , she had been imprisoned in the second bedroom of her family home by her dad, Clark Wiley, because he suspected she was mentally disabled. After Genies rescue in , Clark was discovered to be a controlling man who hated noise and did not want children.   His first child died after being left in a cold garage and a second from birth complications. A third, a boy named John, survived, followed five years later by the girl who would become known as Genie. According to researchers, Clark did not speak to her and he instructed her we, Irene, and son John to do the same. From -months-old, Genie had been strapped into a handmade straightjacket and tied to a potty chair in a silent room during the day.   At night, she was locked inside a cot with a wire cover and fed almost entirely on liquids. Clark growled and barked at his daughter like a dog andshe made a noise, he beat her with a stick. Irene, stricken by fear and poor eyesight, finally fled the house of horrors in . Plagued by cataracts, she mistakenly blundered into the wrong welfare office seeking a disability pension and a social worker spotted Genie. She seemed unsteady on her feet, her limbs jerked and she held her hands in front of her body like a rabbit. Clark Wiley was charged over their treatment of his daughter but killed himself on the day of his trial. According tohe left behind a note that read: The world will never understand.The girls story was told in newspapers and TV bulletins around the world, and later sparked an Emmy-winning documentary,Secret of the Wild Child. Scientic researchers also flocked around the feral child and Genies status soon changed from welfare case to case study. After a long hospital stay, she was moved through a series of foster homes as experts continued to monitor her growth and behaviour. It is not publicly known where Genie is now. It was reported in  that she was living in a state care facility, approaching her th birthday.

The trio have revealed their love story to shed light on how polyamorous relationships work without jealousy - and in the bedroom. They say they would even like a three-way wedding one daythe law ever changes to allow polygamous marriages. The Australian couple had been together for seven years and were considering tying the knot when they spotted a gorgeous stranger at their hotel and asked him to join them for sex.Adelaide workplace trainer Thomas Fennemore, , and Jonny, , a senior admin worker at a defence company - who does not want to reveal his surname - were on holiday in Perth, Western Australia in May  when they made the fateful decision. Thomas said: Jonny and I had never even thought about being polyamorous before. We had watched random documentaries about it and thought, Good for them, but it’s not for us.  It wasnt something we planned to do until we went on holiday to Perth, where we met Anthony, who is  and gorgeous. We were staying in the same hotel and came across him in the elevator and later logged into a local gay dating website to seewe could find him - and we did. Jonny and I agreed he was good looking, and I ended up bumping into him again in the bar. One thing led to another and we had a threesome in our hotel room. None of it was planned, and we thought it was just casual sex, but it turned into a lot more than that. After the encounter, the three men exchanged phone numbers and agreed to get in touchthey were ever in the same city again. But when they learned that product manager Anthony was in Perth on business and lived in Sydney - two hours by plane and  hours by car from Adelaide - they did not expect to see him again.   After joining a WhatsApp group together and messaging constantly as friends, however, they met up again in Adelaide in July  and had another threesome. We all had this underlying feeling that it would progress into something more, but none of us said it at first, said Thomas. After Jonny and I saw Anthony again in July, we agreed we both liked him. It was weird when we admitted it, but communicating helped. By August  we asked himhe wanted to date us, after he also admitted he had fallen for us both. Anthony was equally surprised when his emotions changed from lust to something more. He said: At first, I was surprised they wanted me to date them, as it started as just casual sex. But we spoke so much on the phone and when we met in person again the excitement only grew. Ive never been polyamorous before either and it never crossed my mind. But I did some digging when I met Thomas and Jonny, and the articles I read made me realise it was possible. Id be lyingI said I didnt expect it to be dficult, but its been smooth and were all happy.   After becoming officially polyamorous in August , the trio - who see each other as equal members of one relationship - set ground rules for their sex le. Because of this, for the first six months they only had sex as a throuple when they saw each other every two weeks - but with Anthony still living in a dferent city, problems began to arise. Thomas explained: We didnt want anyone to feel left out, so we made an agreement to only have sex when the three of us were together, but our schedules didnt always match up. Lets face it, its hard enough to match up two people, let alone three - and sometimes one of us isnt in the mood. After a while, quite naturally, we just started having sex with each other and it felt right. Surprisingly, Thomas claims he has not felt an ounce of jealousy when he has known Jonny has been sleeping with Anthony without him - adding that their sex le has remained just as good, despite the addition of a third person. Meanwhile, when the throuple enjoy date nights together, people assume, as there are three of them, that they are just a group of friends. We dont do a lot of hand holding or kissing in public, so people think were just gay friends on a night out, Thomas explained. Throuple relationships are so obscure and out of the norm that no-one assumes were together. This means we never feel judged or shut-in when we all want to go on a dinner date. Although gay marriage has been legalised in Australia, the trio hope that in the future the law will change to allow them to marry as a throuple – however, they want to get to know Anthony better before taking the plunge. And, in time, Thomas believes he and Jonny will consider moving to Sydney, so the three of them can be together. Now that they have stopped being a monogamous couple, Thomas cannot imagine going back. He continued: Going back to monogamy doesnt feel right, butAnthony ever left us Im not sure we would actively seek out a new third boyfriend. We havent had issues or arguments, so I cant see a break-up looming. In fact, always having a third person makes little bickers easier to get over. If either of us argue with each other, theres always another person to go to and ask for help, or just a person to mediate and calm a situation - which works perfectly. Jonny also believes the relationship has been good for everyone. He said: Thomas and I have had our ups and downs, but weve grown from every experience and being poly has been the biggest growth of all. We all fulfill each others dferent needs and this is a new and exciting time. But, despite how well their throuple is working, Thomas would not advise every couple to rush into a threesome, with the hope of it becoming poly. He said: If youve been together long enough and are strong enough then you can attempt it. You have to have great communication and not pressurise your partner, though, as it could really make or break a relationship. Luckily for us, it truly worked and we re excited to see the next chapter of our lives.

Three-year-old Madeleine went missing on the evening of May ,  from an apartment at the Ocean Club complex in Praia da Luz, Portugal, where she was sleeping with her twin siblings. A new podcast, Maddie, hosted by Australian journalist Mark Saunokonoko, features contributions from former Nottinghamshire officer Peter MacLeod. Madeleines mother Kate McCanns speculation that an abductor could have carried her out of a window as she and her husband Gerry said they believed someone had jemmied open the shutters to get into the bedroom was discussed on the second episode.  Mr MacLeod, who had visited Praia da Luz and inspected Madeleines ground floor bedroom window at the resort, said it was not possible for a man to carry a three-year-old child out the window, Nottinghamshire Live reports.In the second episode of the podcast, released on Sunday March , Mr MacLeod said: The window is only absolute maximum cm wide, in reality about cm wide, and its already a metre off the ground. I had a [inaudible] at that and my shoulders are wider than that little window. So although you could climb in sideways you certainly cant jump inyou are a normal-sized person. I frankly do not think its possible.   He then expressed other concerns about the window and said it raised a first red flag. He said it was obvious from local television footage that the window shutters were not damaged, smashed, forced or jemmied. And this was in contrast to the stories in the British media that both the window and the shutters were damaged.   Peter MacLeod retired in  and moved from his West Bridgford home to the village of Ronda in south Spain with his partner Claire Casson the following year. He has visited Praia da Luz and written an e-book about the case called What Really Happened to Madeleine McCann  which looks a number of key aspects of the case, including the sightings of a man carrying a child, the photos taken at the time, and whether Madeleine and her siblings were sedated. Madeleine would now be , turning  in May this year. In November , Operation Grange, the Met Police investigation into her disappearance, was given a further pound, from the Home Office, providing funding up to March  this year.   The parents, Kate and Gerry, last updated the official Find Madeleine website on the th anniversary of her disappearance last year. They wrote: Thank you to everyone who continues to support us and wish us, especially Madeleine, well. After eleven years such warmth and persisting solidarity is truly remarkable, and at the same time a real tonic and boost to our spirit.So far three episodes of the podcast have been released.

She took advice from medical advisers and friends - drinking wine before sex, practising foreplay and even using numbing cream around the labia. But nothing worked and she eventually turned to doctors for help. Revati was put under general anaesthetic for checks and she was later diagnosed with a condition known as vaginismus - when the muscles around the vaginal opening contract involuntarily. The doctors surgically cut her hymen and dilated her in the hopes that she would overcome the condition. However, it had little effect so the couple tried IVF and got pregnant in May last year.   Revati said: We were desperate to overcome it because we wanted to get pregnant, so I looked at the vaginismus support groups for ways to get pregnant. They suggested using syringes to collect semen then inserting it as far as possible into the vagina. We tried an IUI under general anaesthesia because of vaginismus which failed. So we did our first IVF cycle and our second cycle finally worked. Revati had always intended on a C-section delivery due to her vaginismus, but after meeting with midwives and attending birth classes, Revati knew that shed made it this far, so she wanted to experience the full birthing journey.  During the delivery, Revati had to psyche herself up for pushing and despite her vaginismus, she welcomed daughter Eva in February . My daughter was born on February  after  hours of labour. I was at a . cm dilation when I finally had to ask for an epidural because my contractions were getting too intense and I was in great pain. When my midwe said it was time to start pushing, I asked for five minutes to brace myself. I thought about my struggle with vaginismus since my teens, the years of being told to relax and it will happen. I thought of how bad I felt each time I was deprived of something that came naturally to most, yet this was my only chance to experience the miracle of vaginal birth. And then I was ready to start pushing.   Revati said they have not tried sex yet but she is not confident that it wont be a barrier anymore. Ill always remind myself thatI can push a six-pound baby with a head circumference of  cm out my vagina, I can easily take in a penis with much lesser circumference inside of me, she said. I want to show that vaginismus doesnt stop you from giving birth to your baby. Coming from someone like me with severe primary vaginismus -I could do it, you can too.

He got the wire out of his finger last week.“He can start his comeback proper and he’s keeping Andrew Davies company at the moment – they’ve done a lot together on the bikes and they’re doing running on the training ground so it’s great to see them coming back.”Meanwhile, two bodies he’d like back sooner are nearing aand Jim is hoping he’ll have his striking options boosted for Saturday’s home clash with Hearts.Frontmen Andrew Nelson and Craig Curran missed the - defeat to Rangers last midweek but have a chance of athis week.“They are coming on, slow,” Jim said.“They aren’t back on the training ground yet but we’re hoping we’ll have at least one back training by the end of the week.“Craig had an injection in his stomach last week which has settled down nicely but it needs time.“Nelson is his heel which he picked up celebrating his goal at Livingston.“Again that is better but it’s not fully away yet.“What we don’t want to do is bring him back too early and there is a recurrence.“We’ve tried a couple of dferent things but he was tender last week and we had to back off.“It was better over the weekend so we’ll see what he’s like by the end of the week.”At Ibrox, Jim opted for on-loan forward Scott Wright to lead the line in an attempt to catch Steven Gerrard’s Rangers on the hop with pace and will have that option again. However, he’d welcome goalscorer Nelson and “focal point” Curran back.The Dens gaffer said: “Craig has been a focal point for us and brings a lot of people into play in terms of the work he puts in and how he doesn’t let defenders settle.“We went for pace against Rangers by putting Scott Wright up and pace on the sides with Jesse Curran and Andy Dales.“That wasn’t an easy decision because we had Kenny Miller’s experience there as well but we felt we could get down the sides of them when their full-backs went forward but we met them on a night when they were excellent.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee gaffer mcintyre delighted at signing winger josh todd","story":"Dundee manager Jim McIntyre is “delighted” to have secured the pre-contract signing of winger Josh Todd.The -year-old has impressed at Queen of the South over the past year and the Dens Park boss says he’s been a fan of the former St Mirren man for a while.The Tele revealed back in January the Dark Blues were making a move for the Englishman to bring him in at the end of his contract after he shone for the Doonhamers in their - Scottish Cup draw at Dens Park.Todd set up the opening goal for Stephen Dobbie and was a constant menace to the home defence – something Jim is hoping to see from the midfielder in his side next season.He said: “Josh Todd is a player I have liked for a while.“I went to watch him a couple of times before we played them and he did exceptionally well and then did really well in the game here at Dens.“I’m delighted we managed to do that so I’m looking forward to seeing him in the summer.“He’s not a traditional winger that’ll hit the byline but he makes great runs beyond the strikers and he’s got a goal in him.“He’s an athlete, he can get up and down the pitch, has really good conditioning and knows where the goal is.“He’s also quick. You can’t have enough players with pace.“He’s played No  as well and he fits the bill in terms of the type of player we want to bring to the club.”Despite the club’s immediate future unclear as they battle relegation from the Premiership, that’s not stopped Jim putting preparations in place.In the immediate future, however, is Hearts on Saturday at Dens Park.Jim was at Firhill on Monday night to watch the Jambos draw - with Partick in the Scottish Cup and is hopeful his side can repeat their - success at Tynecastle last month.He added: “We had a really good result against them last time.“They’ve had a wee sticky period with injuries but we know we’ll have to defend better than we have because we will be tested.“I always feel we have a chance of winning games, especiallywe can get our strikers fit and, with the wide players we have, I feel we are always going to create.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee skipper martin woods says side need to keep their heads to avoid relegation","story":"Martin Woods says Dundee need to keep their heads in the “crazy” Premiership run-in as they attempt to battle their way to safety.The Dark Blues dropped back into the relegation play-off place after a - thumping dished out by Rangers last Wednesday on the back of a - home defeat to Hibs.However, it was a surprise result at Pittodrie that saw Woods  Co. drop back down the league as Hamilton Accies defeated Aberdeen -, with Saturday also seeing St Mirren close the gap below to one point by defeating Livingston -.Woods, has captained the side recently in Josh Meekings# continued absence, said: “Hamilton was a real shock, I didn’t see that coming at all.“Coming in to hear that after the game was a blow but there will be lots of ups and downs between now and the end of the season, we just need to take care of our own business and, hopefully, that will be enough to steer us clear.“I don’t think anybody would have seen after their game against Rangers, Hamilton going up to Aberdeen and winning - but it’s a crazy league.“Weeks ago, nobody would have seen us going to Tynecastle and getting a result so there will be ups and downs and we have to stick together.“We’ve looked through the Rangers game and seen what we can do better defensively as a team and take that on to the next bunch of games to get some points on the board.”With no match over the weekend due to the Scottish Cup taking priority, it’s been a welcome break for the Dark Blues after a couple punishing results.Woods hopes the breather will allow them to up their game when Hearts come calling on Saturday.“I think it’s been a tough run of games so it’s been good to sit back, reflect and get ready to go again,” he added.“We’ll work on a few things in the training ground and take it into the next bunch of games which are going to be vital.“We have a couple of tough ones coming up with Hearts at home, which we hope to get something out of, and then Celtic at home will be a day we have to be disciplined and get off to a lot better start than we did at Rangers.”If they keep their discipline and manage to up their level from the first half at Ibrox, Woods is confident their luck will turn to help them make it two wins in a row against Hearts, after their - victory at Tynecastle in January.He added: “Against Livingston, they went down to  men, we got a goal in the last seven minutes, we could’ve had a penalty against us so we’ll get days where things go for you.“That’s probably two in a row where nothing’s gone for us at all against Hibs and Rangers.“There will be loads of twists and turns before now and the end of the season, we just need to focus on our performance levels and try to keep that high.“We dropped in the first half against Rangers which wasn’t great but that was a mixture of both them being really good and us not doing as well as we could.“The first goal from a set-piece, we weren’t tight enough and got punished.“From there you could see them get a lt and that’s an important thing to do at Ibrox, to start well.“It was very frustrating but we’ll not be judged by games like away at Ibrox, there will be a lot of big games to come before now and the end of the season.”Woods is also keen to repay the club’s support that has been starved of home success this season with the number of home wins the worst in the ision.“The fans have stuck with us and they were brilliant against Hibs.“I think they can see the performance level has been better in recent weeks.”"},{"url":null,"title":"embrace title race pressure urges dundee uniteds reynolds","story":"Mark Reynolds says the pressure is only going to increase on Dundee United as the season nears its end but he’s backed the Tangerines to embrace it by running down leaders Ross County.The Staggies have a five-point advantage on Reynolds  Co. going into United’s final  matches of the campaign and the on-loan Aberdeen man expects the intensity to increase game by game in the race to promotion.He said: “You need to embrace the pressure.“If you are in a team that’s got aspirations to go up and compete in the Premiership you need to deal with pressure.“There are players that don’t deal with that but they don’t play in big teams.“We have a good enough dressing-room and boys who want it and are used to playing under pressure in big games.“Everyone has the capability of thriving in it and that’s what we need to do.“We just need to keep on winning. Ross County will just keep doing what they do but the good thing is we play them twice so it can still be in our hands.“If we beat them in those games then it starts to put the pressure on but we still need them to slip up to make up the eight points.“We’ve left ourselves a lot to do but all we can do is win the games in front of us.“Regardless of who it is, every game will be huge and three points will be massive.”After the disappointment of losing Sunday’s Scottish Cup quarter-final against Inverness, United are targeting an immediateto their recent good league form with  points picked up from their last  available.They take on bottom side Partick Thistle this weekend at Firhill and Reynolds has urged the Terrors to “step up” and grab the three points.He added: “It was disappointing on Sunday and the boys were hurting – it’s right we feel that disappointment and let it sink in before getting back to training yesterday and then focus on the league.“We realise that was a chance to get in a semi-final but the next  games will be like cup finals.“There will be pressure, teams will try to stop us, they’ll make it horrible and we’ll be a scalp.“Teams will want to take points off us but we need to deal with that, step up and find ways to beat them.“If we keep winning then the pressure will increase and increase and it’ll get harder and harder but we need to deal with that.“We need to step up and,we do that, then we’ll have a good chance.”After a testing double header against Inverness Caley Thistle last week with a league win followed by that cup defeat, Reynolds expects the Highlanders to be a handful for their semi-final opponents – whether it’s this weekend’s opponents Partick or Premiership Hearts.He said: “Inverness are a big physical team – they put the ball up the park and play off the back of it and they have good players in amongst that.“Last Tuesday I thought we stood up to that and we won more balls, picked up more seconds and did enough to keep them out.“We didn’t do that on Sunday, we were second to too many balls.“Inverness can do that to teams. They will cause problems.”Reynolds, meanwhile, is happy to see no astroturf surfaces on the horizon after missing recent away trips to Queen of the South and Falkirk on physio’s orders.“That’s the last game on plastic pitches so, unless we go to the play-offs and have to play on one it’ll be fine.“It was just too early, that’s me not long back from a cruciate ligament injury so the advice from the physios was not to play on it and not risk it.“They were the guys that got me back so it would be daft not to listen to them.”"},{"url":null,"title":"fife firm misses out on lucrative wind farm contract as unions call for holyrood to intervene","story":"BiFab trade unions GMB and Unite have today said a ‘level playing field’ is neededScotland is to secure the large-scale manufacturing contracts from its own offshore renewables sector – and they are asking the First Minister and the Scottish Parliament to intervene.It comes after lucrative contracts for the fabrication of turbine jackets and floating s from the Moray East and Kincardine offshore wind farm projects were awarded to firms in the UAE, Belgium and Spain, leaving empty-handed BiFab yards in Fe.Unions say that despite the best efforts of BiFab owners DF Barnes, the firm cannot realistically compete for major contracts on the basis of cost against European and international competitors who are heavily backed by state subsidies and sovereign wealth funds.Union leaders will write to the First Minister and the Convenor of the Economy, Energy and Fair Work Committee, and ask what steps the Sottish Government have taken to ensure offshore developers commit to domestic manufacturing and for an inquiry to identy the barriers which have prevented Scottish-based firms from capitalising on a renewable manufacturing bonanza.And on the same day the UK Government launch a New Offshore Wind Sector Deal with aspirations of tripling employment in the sector.  GMB and Unite say the empty yards in Fe are a sobering reminder of long-term political failure at both Holyrood and Westminster.GMB Scotland Secretary, Gary Smith and Unite Scotland Secretary Pat Rafferty said: #Ten years ago we were promised a ‘Saudi Arabia of Renewables’ but today we need political intervention to help level the playing field in Scottish offshore renewables manufacturing.#The truth is that state funded European energy and engineering firms, backed by Far East finance and Middle East sovereign wealth funds, are carving-up thousands of jobs and billions of pounds from our renewables sector, and firms like BiFab are left fighting for scraps off our own table.#That one hundred per cent of the manufacturing of the turbine jackets for Moray East and five s for Kincardine will be done in yards outside of Scotland is an absolute scandal.  This cannot continue unchallenged.#To working class communities in Burntisland and Methil there’s no ‘just transition’ or ‘green jobs revolution’ here, just a future that looks heavily rigged against their hopes for employment and prosperity. That’s the real cost of long-term political failure at all levels of government.#The Scottish Government and the public have a stake in BiFab and with it our renewables manufacturing future we owe it to our ourselves to tackle the spaghetti bowl of vested interest groups that’s dominating our renewables sector and to fight for Scotland’s share.#ENDSContact: Peter Welsh, GMB Scotland Communications, on   and Andrew Brady, Unite Scotland Communications, on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee player gerry remembered fondly by some of his school pupils","story":"The photo of former Dundee FC player and coach Gerry Follon was featured on October .This showed Gerry with a group of pupils from St John’s, where he was a teacher, a profession he pursued after giving up playing football.Rob Boag sent in the original tale and put the date of the photo as ‘circa ’.However, one reader was more precise with the date – because he was in the photo.Kirkton reader Andy O’Neill offered: “This photo is of first-year pupils at St John’s in -.“Gerry was a good teacher and a nice man.“He was our register teacher and was always nice to the lads, but could be strict when he had to.“I’m pictured in the second back row, second from right.“Also in the photo, the lad in the centre of the front row is Billy Briggs, brother of Dundee United legend Jimmy Briggs.“Another pupil in the back row, second from left, is John Waddell.

He has marshalled a slight upturn in fortunes in recent weeks which has only been offset by the improved form of their relegation rivals Hamilton Accies and St Mirren, also.However, for Macca, it won’t be job done until Dundee are mathematically safe.And that is a long way off, as they sit in the relegation play-off place, three points behind Accies and only one ahead of the Buddies.Tonight, the Tele takes a look at the Dark Blues’ run-in to the split to see where they can pick up much-needed points.Dundee v Hearts # Saturday, March One of Dundee’s four wins this season, and their only one against a team which currently occupies the top six, came at Tynecastle at the end of January.That - success in Gorgie, coupled with the Jambos’ recent struggles – they are without a win in their last four league outings – will give the Dark Blues confidence going into Saturday’s clash at Dens Park.However, the Dee have only won once at home all season and need that to changethey are to have any hopes of staying in the ision.It’s must-win, for me, and I think they will rise to the occasion.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Celtic # Sunday, March A game in which Dundee will not be judged on come the end of the season but one,they keep it tight at the back, could see them sneak a valuable point.However, I fancy Celtic to go on a really good run as they look to wrap up eight titles in a row under new manager Neil Lennon.They’ll have too much.Verdict: No points.St Mirren v Dundee # Saturday, March One word. Ten letters. Hyphenated. Six-pointer.If the teams go into this one still practically neck and neck, which I expect they will, a win would be extremely valuable for both.However, I feel, with the enormity of the occasion, they will cancel each other out in Paisley.Verdict: One point.St Johnstone v Dundee # Wednesday, April The Dee and Saints have had some tasty encounters in recent seasons and this one should be no dferent with both teams likely to still have plenty to play for.St Johnstone may still be in the mix for the top six while Dundee’s situation is self-explanatory.I fancy the Dark Blues for this one, they play better on the road and have more to lose than the Perth men.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Aberdeen # Saturday, April You have to go back to November  for the last time Dundee got a win of any sorts against the Dons.That’s a run of  games without a win, with  losses in a row.That run has to end at some point, so I’ll back the Dee for a hard-earned draw.Verdict: One point.Total points: Eight points.That would leave Dundee with  going into the split and, you would like to think, put them in a decent position to stay up. That is, depending on how Hamilton and St Mirren get on with their fixtures .Hamilton – Motherwell , Hearts , Kilmarnock , Livingston , St Mirren .Verdict: Five points.St Mirren – Kilmarnock , St Johnstone , Dundee , Celtic , Hamilton .Verdict: Eight points.That would leave Hamilton level and St Mirren a point behind Dundee."},{"url":null,"title":"musical workshop for youngsters at dundees caird hall","story":"Dundee youngsters are to get the chance to hone their musical and performance skills at a workshop in the city next month.Applications have now opened for the Soundbase Byte Music Workshops that will take place at the Caird Hall in April.A spokesman for Leisure and Culture Dundee, which organises the event, said: “Soundbase Byte is a three-day song writing, recording and loop-based music project.“It takes place from Monday April  to Wednesday April .“The event offers the opportunity for young people to work with a team of professional musicians – Paul “Lefty” Wright, Callum Mackie, Alison Whyte and Euan Ross – and learn new skills.Those taking part will learn new skills, improve technique in guitar bass, drums and vocals, write new material and work on performance skills.For further details contact Angela Doran on   or at angela.doran@ leisureandculturedundee.The booking form is available at leisureandculturedundee culture music-development-dundee soundbase.The event costs £ for the three days, with sessions starting at .am each day."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/medw-tele-sports-podcast-twa-teams-4-846x564.jpg ","title":"podcast twa teams one street must win weekend ahead for dundee and united after disappointments","story":"This week, the Tele#s sports reporters George Cran and Calum Woodger are joined by the newsdesk colleague David Wren as they discuss Dundee United#s trip to Partick and Hearts# visit to play Dundee at Dens Park on Saturday.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Shoppers stopped in their tracks and shopkeepers stood on their doorsteps to honour an Ayrshire soldier. Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist. He was laid to rest with full military honours at Drongan where he spent his boyhood and where parents Dan and Rita live. The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund. Jock was laid to rest at Drongan Cemetery, where a guard of honour fired three volleys from their rles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrince CharlesRoyal Scots Dragoon GuardsSouth Ayrshire CouncilMiddle EastArmed forcesRoyal FamilyLove and romanceDundonaldAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr boxing king calvin mccord","story":"NewsAyr boxing king Calvin McCord crowned Scottish Lightweight Champion after thrilling bout at Trump TurnberryThe Ayr star won his first Scottish title in an exciting bout before a sell-out crowd in the Donald J Trump ballroom.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsCalvin McCord celebrates with his title\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRing king Calvin McCord told how he got off the canvas twice to land his first Scottish title.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end line rnli ayr charity","story":"NewsEnd of the line for RNLI Ayr charity branchThe Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.Share Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsAlicia Watson , Robin Whiteand David Macpherson\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a le-saving charity branch following failed attempts to gain members and volunteers. The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

One of the ways is by going into local businesses to encourage them to cut down on what they use.ldquoAn idea we have also had is introducing a pint deposit scheme, similar to the one which is in place at Murrayfield.ldquoThat is something we could look at bringing to Melrose at events such as the Rugby Sevens to cut down on single use plastic. Everyone pays for one pint pot and it is reused, rather than just thrown away.The Scottish Government is also currently shaping a lsquodepositschemersquo for drinks containers following positive feedback in a public consultation.If brought in, it would see consumers reclaim a percentage of the cost of every plastic bottle they recycle.A similar scheme has also been introduced in Norway.Val Miller, vice chairwoman of Melrose Community Council said: ldquoPlastic Free Melrose can take our support as a given.ldquoThere is so much plastic these days.

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane march 1 2019","story":"Ellen Sager, , from Tumbler Ridge, sent a letter to the Courier in August , asking for information about her Campbeltown-born grandfather, Thomas Douglas.Ellen said she knew very little except what her mother, Isabella, who emigrated to Canada in , had written in her grandmother Bessie’s obituary.It read that -year-old Bessie was the widow of Thomas Douglas, a lighthouse keeper who drowned at McArthur#s Head Lighthouse, Islay, in November , just nine months after Isabella was born.Ellen received two replies to her  request, from relatives who gave her the name and address of Robert Douglas, Thomas#s nephew, who was born in Campbeltown in  but moved to Australia in .Ellen said: #When I contacted Robert, he said he did not know that his uncle Thomas had a family.#I have been blessed to have many letters that Robert has written describing le in Campbeltown.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

People pick up dferent ideas from other peoplersquos weddings and events in other parts of the world and then they want that for themselves. Itrsquos an aspiration thing and the Internet has a lot to play, making people more educated, savvy and know what they want. Because of this, people think out the box and are able to put their own personal touch on the wedding to make it unique.Thinking outside the box is definitely what Hassanrsquos clients do well. The biggest wedding he has planned in his career involved a dizzying , guests. With clients more cost-savvy now, he describes how over-the-top ideas from couples are never far.ldquoThe craziest idea wersquove had was when a couple wanted , flowers hung from the ceiling two years ago, Hassan remembers, amused. ldquoIn big spaces like conference rooms, it softens the space, but these things are expensive - particularly with fresh flowers - so we then have to look at the next best thing, how we can achieve it, how it can be set up. We would then have to work with other professionals who can work at heights.In the first episode, we get to see a wedding being put together in the cityrsquos Crowne Plaza as Hassan and his staff scramble to hang hundreds of flowers from the ceiling, albeit fake ones.He explains: ldquoFresh flowers are obscene and not everyone can afford it, so we then look at articial flowers, which look just as real. For the sake of a few hours, they want it to look good, obviously.What is it about weddings that have Asian families going over-the top ldquoPakistanis are not that extravagant in their day-to-day lives, but a wedding is when theyrsquoll either be welcoming a new addition to the family or giving their daughter away, so theyrsquoll spend the most, says Hassan.ldquoWith pound, budgets, you have to take everything into consideration, including clothes and jewellery, which are a big expense. Clients travel to Pakistan and India to get their shopping done. Remember, Asian weddings can last for days as well. Some families will put marquees up at home and host pre-wedding events where the whole family comes together. It does add up to quite a lot of money, but the Bank of Mum and Dad can help out. Though, these days, professional couples themselves are very much in control and can pay everything themselves. Many live with their parents so they have that additional income saved up, he adds.Viewers will get to see a Falkirk mum planning a joint walima for her two sons in episode one as Hassanrsquos clients work on ways to cut down costs.Hassan says: ldquoSome will realise itrsquos too extravagant and theyrsquoll decide to put money into a house instead. But, nowadays, clients will cut down on the number of events they have and just roll it all into one day to cut down on costs.Working with demanding clients and large families comes with its tribulations. Hassan says: ldquoWhen yoursquore working with two families trying to create one event, sometimes it gels really well and other times itrsquos the opposite and you get friction. Usually, one family will sit back and let the other take control. If both families have dferent views, they can clash. Irsquove had that before and it does get tricky. Wersquove witnessed barnies happening right in front of us and it can get awkward, but itrsquos just about stepping in and mediating. In the end, theyrsquore always smiling.Itrsquos been his busiest year on record and, as Asian weddings continue to evolve, whatrsquos next for Hassan and his team ldquoWersquore seeing people sht away from having weddings in Scotland and opting for destination weddings. Several clients have gone out to Turkey, Dubai, South of France and Italy. Thatrsquos a new, up-and-coming trend, to take all the guests out on a holiday and have all your events out there.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9522631.jpg?type=article-full","title":"glasgow-university-evacuated-after-suspicious-package-found","story":"Police have now confirmed they have carried out a controlled explosion.UPDATE:University of Glasgow: Bomb disposal experts carry out controlled explosionA number of buildings on campus were evacuated as a precautionary measure.The buildings that have been evacuated will remain closed for the rest of the day with classes in the affected buildings cancelled.A police spokesperson said: \"The package was not opened and no one was injured.

How is she at miracles, though  Any chance of her turning her hand to the political equivalent of changing water into wine  For that is what Scottish Labour needs as it staggers towards its spring conference in Dundee this weekend.With membership falling, donations down, and impact lessening by the day, the long, slow decline of Scottish Labour continues. The party has become the embarrassing relation of Scottish politics, the one that has to be invited to events because, well, the poor soul does not get out much. They are not doing any harm in the corner, nursing a drink and talking about the old days when vast swathes of Scotland were the colour of the peoplersquos flag.It is a cautionary tale every political party should heed. There is a long list of reasons for the condition Scottish Labour is in, from the partyrsquos arrogance-induced idleness to its inability to adapt to Scotlandrsquos changing political landscape. If we were to go through all the factors in detail we would be here till Christmas , and itrsquos Brexit OrsquoClock already and not a dish washed.Just as a patient at AE undergoes assessment, so the political doctor, spin or otherwise, must zero in on what action needs to be taken immediately, and what can wait. In short, we need to talk about Richard.Richard Leonard  Leader of Scottish Labour  Medium height, grey hair, Tetley tea folk accent, given to wearing red ties  Asks the third question at FMQs  Yes, thatrsquos the one.To appreciate the sorry state of Scottish Labour today one only has to have watched the first instalment of Paul Mitchellrsquos enthralling new documentary Yes No: Inside the Indyref, containing as it did interviews with Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Jim Murphy. It was like the famous graphic showing the evolutionary stages of man, from crouching to upright, but in reverse. Once, Scottish Labour produced future Prime Ministers and Chancellors of the Exchequer. Beginning with Jim Murphy, however, the calibre of leader has been less high office and more David Brent from The Office. No offence to Brent.On the eve of any party conference it is customary for grievances to be aired and tussles take place over the agenda. Conferences are one of the rare times when parties can more or less be guaranteed coverage, evenit is just a line in a radio bulletin. What better time to raise your voice Spin doctor number four for LeonardBut Mr Leonard is now embroiled in not one, not two, but three pre-conference fights. First, his inability to show the faintest leadership in tackling anti-Semitism within the party has been demonstrated, once again, by the rejection of a conference motion demanding ldquorobust disciplinary measures for such behaviour. The Eastwood branch that proposed the motion has been told to submit it to the party conference in September. Good luck with that. So an ideal opportunity to take a strong stand against the toxic racism that has swept up from down south has instead become another own goal for the party.Debating the matter in Dundee would have shown that Mr Leonard was his own man, ready to take steps to distance himself from London when necessary. This has been an unofficial part of the job description of Scottish Labour leader since Johann Lamont quit the post in frustration at London treating the party in Scotland as a ldquobranch office. Mr Leonard, however, seems to go out of his way to give the impression that he and Jeremy Corbyn are as close as two coats of paint, asthis is some kind of recommendation. Any other half-able UK Labour leader would have the party surging ahead of the Conservatives amid the chaos of Brexit. Instead, Labour has become a grisly sideshow, its dithering leader unable to form a position that he can communicate clearly, or get behind fully.Eve of conference bout number two involves Mr Leonard and Gary Smith, the head of Mr Leonardrsquos own trade union, GMB Scotland, for which he worked for more than  years. Mr Smith told The Herald on Sunday that the Scottish Labour leader had not done enough to tackle anti-Semitism, and had missed a chance to pick up on Remain sentiment in Scotland by backing a second EU referendum. Attacks by union leaders on Labour politicians are hardly novel , but this one hit home because it summed up general criticism of Mr Leonard.Union chief slates Labour leaderBout number three is the latest one, involving Mr Leonardrsquos predecessor, Kezia Dugdale. As reported by Tom Gordon, political editor of this parish, Ms Dugdale is furious at her partyrsquos leader, accusing him of airbrushing out of history, or rather the conference guide, a statement from former MEP Catherine Stihler supporting a second EU referendum.Ms Dugdale has now lodged a formal complaint about the man who gave her a written warning for running off to join the Irsquom A Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here circus instead of serving her constituents in parliament. That last sentence sums Scottish Labour up perfectly for the blend of low farce and mutual recrimination it has become.At this point it would be the done thing to suggest writing Mr Leonardrsquos leadership off as an interesting failure and naming possible replacements. Yet no-one of any serious merit wants the job, for to do so means throwing in their lot with the current leadership in London. What ails Scottish Labour cannot begin to be tackled until the rot stops in London, and it will take a General Election, or a very bad Brexit, to bring that to a head. The peoplersquos party is letting down those most in need of its help. If that does not change soon it will not deserve to exist.Read more: Leonard and Dugdale at war"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9524395.jpg?type=article-full","title":"theresa-may-says-snp-have-no-mandate-to-pursue-independence","story":"They demanded a correction and accused the Prime Minister of choosing to ldquoscurry from the Commons chamber rather than hear their complaints.It followed a series of noisy exchanges at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions on the constitution.Aberdeen North MP Kirsty Blackman, the deputy SNP leader at Westminster, raised Tuesdayrsquos unique double vote at Holyrood and the Welsh Assembly on Brexit.The devolved legislatures voted simultaneously against no-deal and urged the UK government to extend the withdrawal process in order to find a better deal than Mrs Mayrsquos.:Whitehall flatly rejects claim Nicola Sturgeon has mandate to call for indyrefMs Blackman said: ldquoIsnrsquot it the case that the Prime Minister has no mandate from Scotland for either no-deal or her deal Mrs May replied: ldquoWe entered the European Union as the United Kingdom.

Itrsquos also true that every business will have its particular obstacles to negotiate.In a packed programme, the day-long conference will feature speakers and discussions on the world of work, but there will be particular focus in some sessions on inclusivity for those attendees, looking at how their own workforce balance has to change.The CIPD in Scotland is working closely with the Scottish Government to effect change. Lee Ann Panglea is Head of CIPD in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and will act as conference chair.ldquoIn Scotland CIPD is working closely with the Scottish Governmentrsquos Workforce Equality team. In this we can support its women and gender equality programme, helping them test our practical tools with employers on developments in flexible working and reducing the gender pay gap.Also representing CIPD at the conference is Tony Vickers-Byrne, Chief Adviser for HR Practice, who will be chairing a session on facilitating and sustaining ersity and inclusion to drive creativity.ldquoThey are losing out on the innovation and creativity which a erse workforce brings ndash and existing employees with protected characteristics will be less likely to put themselves forward for promotion or development projects and programmes, he said.MESSAGE IS FLEXIBILITYThe importance of flexible working is a strong message at energy firm SSE, where Rosie MacRae, HR Service Centre Manager says there is a big drive to encourage it across all roles.ldquoItrsquos one of the starts we track quarterly too. How many of our vacancies went out with a lsquoHappy to talk flexible workingrsquo logo on them. Flexible working can help so many people within an organisation and itrsquos cited as the one thing that should reduce your gender pay gap in  years.Rosie says that the old-fashioned view by some leaders in organisations that flexible working translates as part-time working, is changing but the message needs to be stronger. ldquoItrsquos not the case that most people donrsquot want to work a full week ndash they just need some scope. We need to make sure that roles can be done in a more agile way.Rosie is also aware that no one element can be used to build an inclusive culture. She says it requires a forensic review of every process and every procedure.ldquoAnd thatrsquos from the point before people join the organisation ndash how to attract them. Then we need to look at the complete employee lecycle to how they exit the organisation. Thatrsquos really where last yearrsquos focus was in SSE and where it will be over the next two years.WORKING FOR CHANGEThe challenges in some companies are greater than others, particularly those that have had a traditionally white male workforce.As Group Head of People at Arnold Clark, Lynne McBurney is working to change the image of the motor trade as a potential employer. She agrees with Tony that the change needs to come from the top.ldquoWe are lucky here ndash there is solid support from the top. I really think thatthe directors arenrsquot on board then anybody will struggle to get this journey under way. We are coaching our managers on the benefits of inclusivity, providing training on unconscious bias and good recruitment techniques. We need to make sure that we get a good blend of people through the door and are not just recruiting in your own image ndash which has been happening and is why the motor trade is full of white straight men.Arnold Clark has been hosting internal focus groups with female employees, asking how their experience has been and what they think might be barriers to women coming into the business.ldquoThis is a path to letting people know that in reality, everyone is welcome here. We are working hard to create an environment where anybody can feel comfortable applying and working.Diversity is equally as important for the health of business. Organisations should represent their customer base and develop real trust with them. Twice as many people are currently leaving the UK workforce than are joining it from full-time education, he adds.ldquoThe Government has set a target of increasing the number of employees with a disability by one million by  and flexible working is so important to also help older people and carers to continue to offer their skills and experience to organisations. So a erse workforce is not lsquonice to haversquo ndash itrsquos a business imperative as well as being the right thing.The CIPD Scotland Annual Conference takes place at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre on Thursday, March . www.cipd scottishconference"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9130109.jpg?type=article-full","title":"european-parliament-to-keep-scotland-office-after-brexit","story":"According to the BBC, the parliaments Edinburgh operation will stay open until at least.MEPs are said to be in favour of keeping the office open to provide advice toEU citizens living in Scotland and allowing Scottish organisations to maintain links with the EU post-Brexit.:Brexit passport deadline: Renew before Friday in case of no-dealThe decision taken by the European parliaments president, Antonio Tajani, has been welcomed by the Scottish government who said they hoped the office would become permanent.European parliament to keep Scotland office after BrexitA spokesperson for the Scottish government said: \"We are pleased that the European Parliament is to retain its office in Edinburgh and hope that it will maintain a permanent presence.\"Labour MEP, David Martin, said that the move made \"absolute sense\" as EU laws will still be applied up to Brexit goes aheadwith a deal.:Letters: Theresa Mays bung pales beside the EU funding we will loseHe also added that it made sense as the European Parliament would also be aware of the political situation in Scotland with the SNP government seeking independent membership of the EU.SNP MEP, Alyn Smith, said the decision \"proves the active interest in whats going on in Scotland\"The European Commission has already decided to close its office in Scotland, despite efforts by the first minister and others to keep it open.

And itrsquos about a lot more these days than merely hunting down the wonky veg on the shelves.According to a recent study by Retail Week and the legal business DWF, nearly half of UK consumers are more concerned about environmental impacts than they were a year before. Some % are now actively shopping with companies promoting ethical or sustainable packages.Modern, green-conscious shoppers know exactly what they want. Their top demands are plastic free produce and packaging, compostable carrier bags, plant-based foods, natural fabric clothes and clothing resale and recycling schemes.The message is clear. Selling sustainably may help the climate and therefore be a good thing in itself, but itrsquos also extremely sound business. In what is currently an extremely tough retail climate, it can be a real dferentiator in attracting customers.To maximise the impact of this growing demand, retailers and social enterprises with a real commitment to sustainable trading need to grow and develop their links with each other.These enterprises, % of which are led by and accountable to local communities, supply a wide range of ethical products, helping to meet demand from the big retail buyers wanting to burnish their green credentials.So therersquos a strong mutual interest in getting it right. To further build links across the industry north of the border, the finance and development organisation Social Investment Scotlandis bringing the two sides together at a residential Retail Academy in Falkirk during May.ldquoEthical products with a social purpose are in much greater demand among consumers across the country, these days, says Alastair Davis, the Chief Executive of SIS. The organisation is itself a charity and social enterprise and has invested pound million in more than  organisations across Scotland since it launched in . This is the third retail academy wersquove run and the previous ones have been a success, he adds.ldquoThe event is about facilitating relationships. We hope that ultimately, social enterprises will be able to secure supply deals and be stocked by the retailers involved.ldquoEssentially, the academy is a pitch ndash a meet-the-buyer process. But as well as that, they have the opportunity to learn from the retailers and receive mentoring and guidance. Early stage social enterprises can then make an informed decision aboutthese are business opportunities they want to pursue.The event might also open up investment opportunities, providing funding to qualying social enterprises. The finance can come from SIS itself or from one of its support programmes. The social enterprises taking part may be able to strike a deal with one of the big retailers involved or take advantage of the mentoring and education they offer.ldquoSomeone may not get a deal but learn a lot about how they can grow their business in other says, explains Alastair Davis. ldquoIf thatrsquos the case, we would be entirely happy with that.ldquoTherersquos a whole raft of evidence showing that consumers are becoming more interested in supply chains and the retailers are aware of that. Itrsquos what shoppers are looking for and it can help to retain business. This sort of event also serves to make retailers more aware of what social enterprises are doing.Social enterprises are now an important part of the Scottish business landscape. A census carried out in  showed there were , such operations north of the border, with a third located in rural areas and almost two thirds ndash % ndash led by women. Total annual income was estimated at pound. billion.One of the highlights of the academy will be a pitching session, where each social enterprise will be invited to explain its products. Retailers will be encouraged to provide their own expert feedback and help each potential supplier refine its pitches for future product listing opportunities.The retailers will also have the opportunity to continue their discussions with inidual enterprises andappropriate to offer product listings in their stores. This yearrsquos main sponsor for the event is the supermarket chain Asda.It has been involved in previous academies and has already established trade relationships with a number of social enterprises including the Edinburgh craft brewery Brewgooder, a supplier that donates all its profits to clean water enterprises. Its lager is now available in more than  supermarkets.Polly Jones, Asdarsquos Corporate Affairs Manager, says that the SIS Retail Academy has been an excellent way for the retail chain to throw its weight behind the social enterprise movement.ldquoWe have also discovered new products which wersquove been able to introduce to our stores across the UK.ldquoBy harnessing the power of our retail experience and expertise alongside our store estate and online shopping ision, we can help social enterprises to enter the large retail market while providing our customers with better access to ethical products.The deadline for social enterprises to apply to take part in the academy, which runs between May  and , is March .--------------------------------------------------------------------Drive forward use of public transportGovernment must help prioritise buses as a sustainable method of travel, says Paul White Deputy Director of CPT UK ScotlandThe Scottish Transport Statistics, published last week, should serve as a wake-up call to those tasked with reducing Scotlandrsquos transport emissions.Bus remains by far the most-used public transport mode with more than  million passenger journeys each year. However, despite heavy investment from operators in new fleet and the latest smart technologies, bus patronage has fallen by % over the past five years.The statistics also show that operating costs per bus journey remain higher in Scotland than the UK average. This, and an % reduction over the past five years in funding from local and national government, has a real impact on the bus industry with consequences for both fares and services.It is not just the commercial bus market that is suffering in this climate. Due to budgetary pressures, some Scottish local authorities have taken the tough decision to end funding for supported bus services altogether.The picture is especially bleak when you consider that delivering air quality improvement by tackling car use is dependent on providing a viable, attractive public transport alternative.A recent KPMG study found that there are many contributing factors to bus patronage decline in Scotland including the low cost of car ownership, increasing congestion, and the growth in online shopping . KPMG concluded that % of the factors that impact on bus patronage are outwith bus companiesrsquo control. As such, coverage which lays blame for patronage decline solely at the feet of bus operators is wideof the mark.Bus companies want to carry more people. However, the bus sector requires political will and brave leadership ndash nationally and locally - to create a supportive framework that prioritises sustainable and active travel. It is  years since John Prescott labelled the bus a workhorse ldquofamiliar, even friendly, but rather dull and unexciting.Sadly, wersquore still fighting that uninformed perception today. More still has to be done to put bus and bus passengers on an equal standing with other modes.Bus passengers can only look on with envy at projects like the refurbishment of Glasgow Queen Street Stationor the delivery of the Subway refurbishment programme . Meanwhile Buchanan Bus Station, responsible for  million bus journeys per annum, is due to be refurbished at the cost of poundk. The disparity in funding between modes is staggering.The Scottish Government will shortly embark on a new Scottish Transport Projects Reviewthis summer. The review will look at means to address government aims around reducing emissions and improving journey times, quality, accessibility and affordability.More grand projects that cater for the car or allocate huge chunks of funding for small but expensive rail schemes are not the answer.I hope the STPR process will acknowledge the importance of the comparatively low-cost infrastructure improvements required to make walking or cycling easier and safer ndash and bus journey times quicker and more reliable. This latter ask could form part of a local Bus Partnership with local operators committing to service improvements in .Meeting Scotlandrsquos air quality targets means getting people out of cars and onto more sustainable modes of transport. Nobody will leave their car behind when therersquos no viable, attractive transport alternative. Providing a framework for bus patronage growth is a key piece in the air quality jigsaw.Hopefully these recent statistics serve their purpose and Scotlandrsquos bus passengers, responsible for % of all public transport trips, become a priority andnot an afterthought within Scotlandrsquos transport policy.------------------------------------------------------------------Project makes world our oysterConservation is the aim of the lsquopound Billion Challengersquo where private, public and non-profit partners drive investment in Scotlandrsquos natural environmentAN ambitious new initiative aims to pioneer new ways of funding nature conservation in Scotland through the launch of the pound Billion Challenge.Led by the Scottish Wildle Trust and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , the Scottish Conservation Finance Project aims to generate new forms of investment in Scotlandrsquos stocks of natural capital in ways that will deliver signicant environmental, social and economic benefits, as well as s for investors.Natural capital can be defined as the worldrsquos stocks of natural assets which include geology, soil, air, water and all living things.The project brings together organisations from the private, public and non-profit sectors to develop cutting-edge investment and funding models for large-scale nature conservation activities, for example planting native woodlands, restoring oyster reefs and creating urban green spaces.ldquoGlobally, investment in nature needs to increase substantially to meet the growing challenges posed by climate change and bioersity loss, says Jonny Hughes, Chief Executive of the Scottish Wildle Trust.ldquoScotland was among the first nations in the world to pledge support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and has been at the forefront of a number of pioneering environmental initiatives, including the World Forum on Natural Capital.ldquoThe aim of this new initiative is to provide a practical opportunity to come together, exchange ideas and collectively achieve a lasting impact. Ultimately we want to begin to drive billions of pounds of investment into Scottish conservation in the coming years.According to a  report by Credit Suisse AG and the McKinsey Center for Business and Environment, an estimated - billion per year is needed globally to preserve healthy ecosystems on land and in the oceans. Currently only around  billion is available per year, mostly in the form of public and philanthropic funds.Terry ArsquoHearn, Chief Executive of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, said: ldquoIn Scotland, we currently using the resources of three planets, but only have one.ldquoGood leaders say ndash therersquos only one planet, we have to work within it. But great leaders say ndash how do we turn this from a threat into an opportunity for our organisation  The Scottish Conservation Finance Project is an exciting opportunity to bring the right people together to meet this challenge.The pound billion Challenge was showcased in London last week at the Natural Capital Investment Conference at the Royal Society, following its successful launch in Edinburgh in early February."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-dismisses-idea-of-wildcat-independence-referendum-at-fmqs","story":"It comes after Keith Brown, the SNP depute leader, suggested that a referendum could occur evenit was rejected by the UK Government.:SNP deputy leader Keith Brown backs wildcat IndyrefKeith Brown said:ldquoIf we want to have a referendum, then we decide wersquore going to have a referendum. and that Brexit could becomeldquonormalisedthe Yes movement ldquodidnrsquot go relatively soon for independence.However, the idea of such a referendum seemed to be dismissed by Nicola Sturgeon at FMQs.When quizzed by opposition during First Ministers Questions, Nicola Sturgeon said:\"The legal basis for the next independence referendum should be the same as the basis for the last independence referendum.\"And the only reason were talking about this issue is the disgracefully anti-democratic stance of the Conservatives, who refuse to recognise a mandate at two elections and endorsed by this Parliament.\"When responding to claims that the SNP were obsessed with the idea of a second independence referendum, the First Minister said:\"Let me tell Jackson Carlaw what my obsession is right now.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

It is shameful that it has taken a fiasco like this for the Scottish Government to sit up and take notice.\"Thankfully, the mother and both babies are healthy and we must thank the local NHS staff for their excellent work.\"However, this is a situation that neither the mother nor the staff should have been put in and we desperately need action from the Scottish Government.\"Geography and distance should not be something expectant mothers have to deal with and the government must accept that no-one should lack access to health services simply because of where they live.\"He spoke out after the womans ordeal was made public. She went to Caithness General Hospital in Wick in November after her waters broke when she was  weeks pregnant.It was decided she should go by ambulance to Raigmore in Inverness, over  miles away, to have her babies.But as she was near Golspie, her contractions became stronger and she was taken to the local community hospital, the Lawson Memorial, where she gave birth to a boy.A helicopter was then to take the woman to the Highland capital but was unable to land due to frost on its propellers so she made the rest of the journey by ambulance and gave birth to the second twin.Labours Rhoda Grant raised the case in parliament and claimed the air ambulance should have been called when the woman went into labour.She asked: \"It begs the question why was the air ambulance or emergency retrieval team not tasked initially to airlt the mum from Caithness \"Will the First Minister investigate this and will she make sure that the air ambulance treats situations like this as a priority \"Nicola Sturgeon promised to investigate and asked Scotlands health secretary, Jeane Freeman, to look into it.Bill Fernie, the chairman of Chat, said the case highlighted the groups concerns about mothers having to travel to Inverness to give birth.\"Fortunately, we have not had a tragedy yet and hopefully we never will ndash but this underlines the fears we have had since the changes were made to the local maternity unit.

He questioned Minister for Public Finance, Kate Forbes MSP, in the Scottish Parliament earlier this afternoon, Wednesday, asking how this shortfall squares with the government’s commitment to the principle of fair funding for our leline internal ferry services.According to the Orkney MSP, the minister responded by saying that the government recognise the challenges in running these ferry services and that they have been clear in their budget that adequate funding is to be delivered.Commenting after the exchange, Mr McArthur said: “We now know that the Scottish Government has cut funding for Orkney’s internal ferry services by £, compared to last year.  This has left a £.m shortfall in the Council’s budget for delivering these leline services.#It is baffling how Ministers think this approach is consistent with their commitment to the principle of fair ferry funding.  It certainly flies in the face of the will of parliament, which voted for the government to deliver on its earlier promises.“Meantime, the island communities that rely on these leline services are left picking up the tab, including a three per cent increase in fares this year.  Ministers may ‘recognise’ the challenges of running these services, but they also must recognise their obligations genuinely to provide adequate funding.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also signals the desperation with which the Scottish Government is now approaching the whole area of education –you can’t mend it, chuck a barrel of money at it. Well, the EIS’s head is well inside the mouth of this particular gt horse, and we can leave them there for the moment. What is necessary, and what isn’t happening, is a much more radical discussion of where Scotland lies educationally, so here are some more thoughts for public consideration, while the teachers and the Government discuss how to deliver more of the same at agreater cost.I have already suggested that we need a much more inidually tailored and much more flexible approach to the way schools are structured, but of course there is also the issue of what we actually teach in the schools. As you will know, the current Scottish curriculum goes under the title of ‘Curriculum for Excellence’when, as many commentators have pointed out, it’s not a curriculum at all, and it doesn’t seem to be leading towards excellence. A fairer name would be something like ‘A Theory towards Vagueness’ or possibly a ‘Prescription for Citizenship’. The Curriculum for Excellence took as its starting point what were called the four ‘capacities’, which were – and like many Scottish teachers, it took me months to learn them – that children should be effective contributors, responsible citizens, confident iniduals and ... wait for it ... successful learners.: The grim reality of le as a pupil in a Scottish school – Harriet SweatmanI can’t imagine there is anyone – parent, pupil or teacher – who doesn’t think that schools have a duty to produce successful learners. Scottish schoolchildren – and this in itself is an issue worthy of discussion – spend about seven hours a day, four-and-a-half days a week,  weeks of the year in schools. This amounts to only about  per cent of their entire time for  years,they stay to S. What has happened is that all of society’s expectations for young people are now meant to be managed by schools. It’s as , on entering hospital with a broken leg, the expectation is that hospitals will – as well as mending the leg – make children better, more confident, happier people, ready to face the world, and deal with every aspect of their capacity as young citizens of Scotland. These other qualities, of kindness, social awareness and confidence, can be achieved in other ways, and it’s simply not feasible to carry on with CfE when academic standards, including the basic levels of literacy and numeracy, are dropping.I believe that primary education needs to have a bit less faffing about and focus, in the classroom, on reading, writing, numeracy, IT skills, science, creative thinking and resilience, this latter through things like outdoor education and team building, with the aim of beginning to combat this huge epidemic of unhappiness, some of it actual mental illness, which is afflicting teenagers.: Cameron Wyllie: Face the facts, some kids are just smarter than othersI think that the first step in closing the poverty-related attainment gap should be to ensure that all Scottish schoolchildren can read and write and use a computer at a level appropriate to their age by the time they leave primary school. I would have a certicate of literacy, as previously suggested but eventually rejected by the unions and others, at age . Then I think that in secondary education, after S, there needs, in combination with the flexible approach to academic and vocational education, to be much greater flexibility with regard to subjects studied and the levels of study. We have a problem in Scottish classrooms which I characterise as the S French problem, though it applies in other subject areas too. Many, many Scottish pupils do French in S and lots of them, particularly less ‘academic’ boys and girls don’t like it in my view the modern language courses are particularly bad, despite the best efforts of teachers to teach them. Many, many children are bored in S French, either because it’s way too easy, or because it’s simply something they are not interested in or can’t do. We have children sitting in French classes who can’t read or write properly in English.At every turn, when we are deciding on what subjects should be taught and what level each child is being taught at, the watchword should be ‘appropriate’ – appropriate to that child. We do need to look long and hard at what we offer and its applicability. And the patronising view that every child needs to have an extended bash at academic learning so they are not shut off from entering university needs to be questioned hard, while at the same time we do more to push our most academic pupils. One personal, fairly large, bee in my mortar board is to ask why it is that we don’t insist that young people know more about Scotland today – most young people would struggle to identy the dferences between Scottish political partiesbut we expect them to grow up and vote about Brexit – remember the Scottish Government wants young people to vote at but the education system doesn’t do much to help them.So my cheeky finishing thought is this – let’s make the modern studies curriculum more Scottish biased, and let’s make it a compulsory subject from S to S.

She added that Mr Leonard had insulted the pair by failing to ensure their years of service were marked at the conference.Her letter also criticised his stance on Brexit and expressed “disappointment” at his recent remarks that he would rather there was a Labour leave deal than a second referendum to remain in the EU. However, a Scottish Labour source said that there had been a “genuine misunderstanding” and Mr Leonard has written to both MEPs to apologise.In her letter, Ms Dugdale claims that, on the instruction of Mr Leonard, and without the MEPs’ consent, a description of Brexit being “a tragedy for our country” and their support for a second referendum was deleted.She wrote: “I wish to formally complain about the way in which Catherine Stihler and David Martin have been treated ahead of conference. From what I can see from the agenda, there is no formal opportunity for them to speak or indeed a formal item to thank them for their combined  years of electoral service to the party.“If that wasn’t bad enough, I was shocked to discover from Catherine that her statement in the conference guide had been amended without her consent. When that was challenged, she was told it was on your direction and that you had the final say on what was printed.”The letter repeats the deleted section which states: “Brexit is a tragedy for our country and for the workers and communities that Labour represents. That’s why David and Catherine fully support a people’s vote with the option to remain in the EU.”This section was replaced with: “The complete mess the Tories have made of Brexit means they are putting Scottish people’s jobs and our industries at risk. Labour will always put them first.”Ms Dugdale added: “I find that wholly inappropriate and I can’t possibly understand why you would seek to censor her final words to party members, especially since what she states is party policy and has been since last September.“Can I encourage you to please take urgent steps to recty what I consider to be a considerable insult and ensure that we thank these two outstanding MEPs properly at conference.”The letter also spells out Ms Dugdale’s concerns about Mr Leonard’s views on Brexit. She states that she has found the party’s stance “disappointing” and that it was “in this context” that she was making her complaint.Last week Mr Leonard said he would rather have a Labour Brexit deal than a second EU referendum – but that he would still back Remaina second vote was held. He has faced criticism for failing to back a second referendum despite Scotland voting to Remain in the  vote.Ms Dugdale resigned as party leader in August  citing her dferences with UK leader Jeremy Corbyn over Brexit as one reason to quit. At last year’s Scottish Labour conference, she was instrumental in launching the campaign group Scottish Labour for the Single Market.She wrote: “You know that I’ve found the party’s position on Brexit and a second EU referendum disappointing for some time. As I said at group last week and repeatedly over the past few months. I don’t believe there is such a thing as a good Brexit or indeed a ‘jobs first Brexit’. “I remain utterly convinced, rooted in all the evidence I have seen, that it will be immensely damaging for the Scottish and UK economy. A price which will once again be paid by those in low-paid and insecure work, the very people we seek to represent.“The move towards supporting a People’s vote is a welcome one, but it should have happened much much earlier. I note... that you’d sooner we left the EU than give people a final say. “That’s disappointing for the many party members who fervently back a final say and indeed all of our voters who are now a bit lost for a home.”It is believed that the letter was shared with all Scottish Labour MSPs in Holyrood and the seven MPs in Westminster. A source close to Ms Dugdale said she had received support from MSPs for her letter. “Kezia felt it was important that all elected members should know that their words can be changed and printed without their permission. She has received a lot of supportive responses from MSPs who also believe that Catherine and David are being treated very shabbily by a party they have worked so hard for, over so many years.”A spokesperson for Ms Stihler said: “Catherine is a long-standing supporter of a People’s Vote and will be making her views clear as a Labour Party member at this weekend’s conference.”Party sources claimed there had been a failure of communication between Mr Leonard’s office, Ms Stihler and party general secretary Brian Roy which led to the changed paragraph remaining in the conference programme rather than it reverting to the original words.A Scottish Labour source said: “This was a genuine misunderstanding and Richard has written to Catherine and David to apologise.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"snp deputy says nicola sturgeon should call indyref2 without uk permission","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Deputy leader of the SNP has been criticised after comments emerged in which he endorsed holding a referendum on independence eventhe UK Government refused to transfer the legal power to do so.

Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example.Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead.I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner #lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian. In fact, your words remind me of these words from a famous historical document: #We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal##.

In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"name chosen for skye resort following cash prize","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe hotel will be situated on the site of the former golf course on the Struan Road in Portree.After receiving close to  entries, Mr Charles Garton Jones # a London-based property developer who also owns the Cow Shed, a boutique bunkhouse in Uig # picked the winning name # #The Bracken Hide#, which was submitted by Skeabost resident Ian Williams.“In all, we had nearly  suggestions,” said Mr Garton Jones. “It was great fun going through them and narrowing them down, but there was one that stood out from the crowd. #The Bracken Hide#, we thought, conveyed a lovely feeling of exploring the wilderness.”Mr Williams, who received a cheque for £ for his winning suggestion, said the idea was prompted by a photo of the resort which sparked a memory from his childhood.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1447107.jpg--.jpg?1550046202000\n","title":"2 800 donation for braid valley community first responders","story":"THE new Braid Valley Community First Responders Scheme enjoyed a great response to their Open Day with more than  people attending.This was an ideal opportunity for potential volunteers at NIAS Northern HQ, Ballee to find out more information and they showed a lot of interest in joining the scheme.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460409.jpg--.jpg?1550570234000\n","title":"children from gran canaria welcomed to ballymena","story":"A group of children from Gran Canaria have been visiting Ballymena to take part in the annual local music festival.The group of  children are pupils of the British School of Gran Canaria, and are taught by local woman Claire McDonald.Claire, who is the head of the music department at the English speaking school has accompanied her pupils to Northern Ireland to take part in the festival, sightsee, improve their English skills and experience the culture of Northern Ireland.The young people, who are all aged between  and  years old are keen musicians, with some playing the piano, drums, violins while others are singers.They have experienced success at the festival, with some winning first and second prizes and others were highly commended.The group have been travelling around NI, visiting the Giant’s Causeway, Hillsborough Castle and the Titanic museum and performed in a local concert with Kellswater Flute Band.This has been their first taste of Northern Ireland, and it did not disappoint!One of the students, Miguel said: “I’ve really enjoyed my trip. “I play the drums and the musical festival has been great.“We learn English at school so it’s good to speak it here.”Fellow student Alicia, said: “Northern Ireland is great and the festival has been a wonderful experience.“I was really excited to play with the band but my favourite part was the Giant’s Causeway and the music festival.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460481.jpg--.jpg?1550570359000\n","title":"rodney quigley announces independent candidacy","story":"Ballymena man Rodney Quigley has announced he plans to stand in this year’s Council elections.Announcing his candidacy on Facebook this week, the well known community activist posted: “I intend to stand as an Independent candidate in the Mid and East Antrim council elections on nd May.“As someone who has worked tirelessly as a community worker for over  years, and as a member of the policing and community safety partnership for  years, I feel that I have something to offer at local council level.“I have dealt with many community issues in the past and will continue to put the community first on any issues that are brought to my attention. “Ive also worked with many councillors on many issues in the past and would continue to work along side them for the good of everyone in Ballymena.“I know that many people have said its time for change and it would be good to see a few new faces within Mid and East Antrim council.“If this is the case Id like to be one of the new faces.“I can assure people thatelected, I will put my best foot forward every time and will work to resolve local issues for everyone in Ballymena.”Election datesNomination forms for prospective candidates must be ed to the Deputy Returning Officer by pm on Monday April , .The election will be held on Thursday, May , .

There was a good each-way shout for Elliott’s Shattered Love , but the Co Meath trainer insisted he’d love to be training Presenting Percy. David Casey was keen on whatever Mullins aims at the race , but cautioned that he wouldn’t back last year’s winner Native River “with stolen money” following his below-par efforts this season.Elliott appears to have great chance of landing the feature on Day One with the brilliant mare Apple’s Jade.Without giving too much away, he added that he “couldn’t be happier” with Apple’s Jade, who is four from four this season.Defending champion Buveur D’Air was friendless at the top table while Casey reported Laurina to be in rude health, but stressed that she would need to improve on her form having won a weak Mares’ Novices’ Hurdle in .Brain Graham feels the seven-pound Mare’s allowance will be a key factor and thinks Apple’s Jade will prevail.Altior , unsurprisingly, was an almost universal tip to retain the Champion Chase with only Winstanley opting for second-favourite Min .If Buveur D’Air was largely opposed by the  in the Champion Hurdle, Stayers’ Hurdle ante-post favourite Paisley Parkwas described as the lay of the meeting by bookmaker Ronan Graham.The  seemed keen to take on the favourite with the reliable Supasundaeand Faugheen .

During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it.

I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process.

Officials at Belfast City Council have now given the green light to Clear Rosemounts proposal to knock it down to make way for a new five-storey apartment building with three retail and cafe units. The companys directors include Colin Johnston, who heads the Clear Healthcare pharmacy group.The developers have said they expect that between  to  jobs will be created during the construction phase.Mr Johnston is also involved in a bid to convert a former Northern Bank in Lurgan into a coffee shop.The High Street building was better known in recent years as the premises of homegrown department store Houstons. Lurganbridge Ltd, of which Mr Johnston is a director, has submitted an application to turn the ground floor of the building into a coffee shop.Clear Rosemounts proposed development on the Lisburn Road involves the bank and a vacant site next door. The site also stretches onto Ashley Avenue.Planning permission was previously granted to Largie Developments in  to build  apartments and three retail units on the site.

They are as clear as day and we are continuing to discuss them,” he said.Chancellor Philip Hammond warned Tory Brexiteers against voting down Mrs May’s deal next week, saying rejecting it would lead to a delay to Brexit.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Philip Hammond told Tory Brexiteers to think ‘very, very carefully’ about next week’s vote “If the Prime Minister’s deal does not get approved on Tuesday then it is likely that the House of Commons will vote to extend the Article  procedure, to not leave the European Union without a deal, and where we go thereafter is highly uncertain,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“For those people who are passionate about ensuring that we leave the European Union on time it surely must be something that they need to think very, very carefully about now because they run the risk of us moving away from their preferred course of actionwe don’t get this deal through on Tuesday.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  The Chancellor said he believed MPs would not support leaving the EU without a deal, but refused to be drawn on how he would voteMPs are asked whether they want to delay Britain’s withdrawal.“I’m not going to speculate about something that hasn’t happened and I don’t think will happen because I think the Government is very clear where the will of Parliament is on this,” he said.“Parliament will vote not to leave the European Union without a deal next Wednesday, I have a high degree of confidence about that.”Meanwhile, French Europe minister Nathalie Loiseau said the Withdrawal Agreement could not be reopened, and that it represented “best possible solution”.“We cannot reopen this negotiation on the Withdrawal Agreement because it is balanced,” she told Today.“We don’t like the backstop, we don’t want to have to implement it, andwe have to, we don’t want to stay in the backstop.“We all agree that it should be temporary, and that it’s a last resort solution.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jeremy Corbyn has held talks with senior Tories Earlier, Jeremy Corbyn said he was”more certain than ever” MPs will back a deal to keep the UK closely tied to the EU after holding  talks on Wednesday with senior Tories.The Labour leader met former ministers Sir Oliver Letwin and Nick Boles along with Labour MPs Stephen Kinnock and Lucy Powell to discuss their proposed “Common Market .” plan which would keep the UK in the single market and the customs union.Writing in the Daily Mirror he said he confident they could “find a way to work across Parliament to force the Government to back a sensible Brexit plan that protects jobs”.“I will continue to reach out to get a decent Brexit deal so our country can spend more time talking about our children’s future than a customs union,” he said.“We will do whatever we can to find a solution that can unite the country so, together, we can face down the real challenges and seize the opportunities in this moment of great change.”However the move risks infuriating Labour MPs who back a second referendum, after he last week said the party would support another public voteit is unable to get its own Brexit plan passed."},{"url":null,"title":"sporting greats provide pep talk ahead of special olympics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Orkneys was problematic as itrsquos a long way away. It would also have costed a lot of money to tow up into position but also the conditions up there were not what was needed.ldquoOur Strangford site has fast-flowing water, a pure rock sea bed and is a stonersquos throw from the shoreline. Itrsquos very accessible and also happens to be a beautul part of the world.Mr Smith said that the Subhub would be in the lough for the next three months at least as it was being assessed.ldquoWe are working with Cuan Marine Services who provides us with daily reports really to see what the environmental impact is for marine mammals.He said that QED Naval had developed Subhub which was less expensive to make, to move into position and to decommission, than other tidal wave s.He believes that some industrial load customers could avail from its electricity.ldquoIndustrial load customers could be paying between -p per kWH now, added Mr Smith.ldquoIf we could work with local industrial customers to get power purchase agreements, there is potential for us to cut their fuel bills for heating water to less p per kWh.QED Naval has worked in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Sustainability at Queenrsquos University on the project.The Subhub spent last year being equipped at Cimpina Engineering in Belfast before being moved to Strangford Lough.This is the second tidal power development in Strangford Lough.The worldrsquos first commercial-scale tidal turbine was commissioned on the lough in July, .The .MW SeaGen project developed by Marine Current Turbines comprised two KW turbines and represented a poundm investment. It has since been decommissioned..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celebration at Dromara for fanciers  ","story":"DROMARA HPS recently held their annual dinner and prize distribution in the Pheasant Restaurant, Annahilt.Unfortunately, numbers were down a little this year with some members unable to attend due to health reasons and the club would like to wish Albert McKinstry and Harry Silcock speedy recoveries.Although some older members were missing, it was great to welcome two new members, Matthew Russell and Christopher Rooney who was accompanied by his we, Gail.After a beautul meal Mr and Mrs Rooney presented the prizes and cups. As everyone knows, Dromara is a strong club but this year surpassed all expectations with the club being the only one in Ireland to have its members win two INFC Nationals.N Black  Son won the Friendship National and N Edgar  Son won the Skibbereen National.The Edgar partnership had a fantastic young bird season as well, winning the NIPA Young Bird National from Rosscarbery.N Black  Son also won the NIPA section D Old Bird Channel fancier. Russell Brothers also had another great season winning the highly prized McBride Cup for the channel averages plus winning Penzance Classic.C  L Fryers had the first bird from Dromara in the Kingrsquos Cup. McKinstry Brothers had some great results along with T Marshall  Son, first bird in Penzance Young Bird, D McCandless Yearling National winner.Mr  Mrs Stevenson again did well inland as well as beating the big boys on the channel by winning first Tallbenny.H Silcock had some great positions and were unlucky to be fourth open Friendship National and still be only second in the club.After the prizes and trophies were handed out Mrs Rooney presented Fiona Stevenson with a bouquet of flowers mdash a small token of thanks for the hospitality from her and Bobby throughout the year.As usual, the highlight of the evening was the ballot and with Stanley McKinstry not attending this year his luck was taken up by Fiona Stevenson.In fact they won so many young birds Bobby thought he might not even have to breed any of his own. N Edgar  Son and N Black  Son kindly donated two young birds each.Edgarrsquos two were won by new member Chris Rooney and Mr  Mrs Stevenson and Blackrsquos two young birds were won by Gordon Kirkpatrick and Mr  Mrs Stevenson.C  l Fryersrsquo young bird was won by non-fancier William Skelly, who is putting it into the stable of N Black  Son to be raced.Cromie  Magee and Sonsrsquo was won by Russell Bros, Mr  Mrs Stevensonrsquos by Chris Rooney, Russell Bros by H Silcock, T Marshall  Sonrsquos by Mr  Mrs Stevenson and A Bradleyrsquos was won by P Connor..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Conal Montgomery samples new sound  ","story":"KILLYLEAGH rocker Conal Montgomery is working on new original music for the first time in years.The well-known singer who has performed at bikersrsquo rallies and conventions around the UK for the last  years may surprise some of his fans with his new sound.Instead of the soaring progressive rock vocals he is known for, Conalrsquos new music is softer, more reflective folk style.The  year-old says that his new music is indicative of where he is in his personal le now.The  year-old explained: ldquoI havenrsquot felt like this for years particularly as when I was drinking I really couldnrsquot be bothered with writing music.ldquoI wrote songs in the early s but alcohol and drugs just took over my le and my time was wasted.ldquoFor  odd years I didnrsquot do anything and now that Irsquom sober, I just have a love for it.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space.

They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass. I wonder who is going to look after them given the dficulty I have in getting someone to clean the beach ldquoWe need to invest resources to ensure the proper management of the beach and encourage people to go to parts of it where there is sand.Cllr Andy McMurray described pursuing the idea as ldquofolly given the current problems in keeping the promenade tidy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"O’Hare hat trick secures victory  ","story":"A SUBLIME Donal OrsquoHare hat-trick at Glennon Brothers Peare Park, Longford, on Sunday reignited Downrsquos promotion aspirations.The Burren assassin was in a class of his own against the league leaders, but it also took some heroic goalkeeping from Castlewellanrsquos Rory Burns to keep Down on track for their third win on the bounce.Burns, who plays in midfield for his club, was inspirational between the sticks and in addition to keeping out another penalty mdash his second in three games mdash he produced several outstanding saves to deny Longford a goal they craved.

While planning permission was secured, the proposal fell through due to the adverse economic circumstances at the town.The site was subsequently sold several years ago to a local businessman who is behind the new proposal to redevelop site which has been approved by a range of statutory agencies.Itrsquos understood access to the proposed new hotel will be via Inch Abbey Road, with parking located to the side and rear of the new , square metre building. There will also be a dedicated parking area for coaches.Original plans for the new hotel described finishing the exterior of the building in stone slate, with the accommodation centred around a landscaped courtyard. The proposed hotel development also includes plans to upgrade the Inch Abbey Road junction with the Belfast Road.News that the exciting new proposal is set to be given the green light next week comes after recent confirmation that planning permission is being sought to provide  new hotel rooms in Downpatrick town centre.The Downpatrick Property Trust is aiming to convert a number of existing flats at the junction of Market Street and Irish Street to provide what is being described as ldquooverflow hotel bedroom accommodation for nearby Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn.The proposal is also seeking permission for several hotel serviced apartments and to convert existing ground floor retail accommodation in Irish Street to a wheelchair accessible bedroom with an en-suite shower and toilet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has placed tourism at the top of its agenda and is striving to attract more international visitors to stay overnight across the district. It has highlighted the need for additional hotel accommodation across the district.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the plannersrsquo recommendation for the Belfast Road site will be approved next week, paving the way for what he described as an ldquoexciting new development to help increase visitor number, provide new jobs and boost the local economy.He said the project would create jobs in the construction industry, provide a boost for local buildersrsquo suppliers and act as a catalyst for additional private sector investment.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere is a need for more bed space in Downpatrick and this new development, which will complement existing provision, is most welcome. The fact that new conference facilities form part of the new hotel proposal is an added boost to the town.ldquoThe new hotel will help the local council with its drive to attract more overnight visitors to the district and I very much look forward to construction work getting underway..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Saints lose to league leaders  ","story":"SAINTFIELD United hosted league leaders Aquinas in a much-anticipated clash of two of the top teams in the league.It was the visitors who drew first blood when the first corner of the game was kept alive at the back post and struck into the net to make the score -.The Saints tried to get their passing going, but were snuffed out by their opponents who didnrsquot want to allow the hosts to settle.They continued to cause trouble from set-pieces and Saintfield paid the price when once again a free kick was kept alive and the visitors were first to the second ball to make the score -.Saintfield now faced a great uphill battle, they kept trying to play their football, but chances were few and far between for both sides.Saintfield came out fast in the second half, looking to put their opponents onto the back foot and get back into the game.They thought they had when some good play down the right led to a shot from Adam Childs that hit the underside of the bar and appeared to cross the line, but not in the eyes of the referee who ruled against the hosts and the scoreline stayed -.The game was even throughout, the only other noteworthy chance falling to James Sofley who couldnrsquot find a way past the Aquinas lsquokeeper.The Saints will be looking to bounce back and get their revenge when they travel to Rathmore to face the same opponents this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sally Ann is spot on  ","story":"FORTY years of patient waiting ended for Spa member Sally Ann Douglas last week when she recorded her first hole-in-one of her golfing career.The clubrsquos former lady captain hit the perfect shot at the par three eight hole in a game partnered by Joe and Marlene Crawford.ldquoI used a pitching wedge and Marlene and I watched it all the way until it landed in the cup, she said. ldquoI just thought, brilliant.

His sister Eva is the last survivor of that family unit.Educated at the Hardy Memorial School, Matthew left at the age of  to join the Bairnswear Company at their factory on the Loughgall Road in Armagh. There, he proved to be a dedicated, hardworking employee, and he stayed with the firm for the whole of his working le.In the course of his employment he worked his way through the ranks, to become the engineer in Armagh, and when the factory closed there, being transferred to Scotland for two years and England for another  until his retirement.Bairnswear also introduced him to his future we, Doreen, who worked in the clerical department: the couple were married in Lislooney Presbyterian Church, and celebrated  years of marriage last summer.The couple had two children, Colin and Neil, and the family grew again with Colin’s marriage to Orla and Neil’s marriage to Nichola - and then the arrival of the apple of Matthew’s eye, his granddaughter Grace.Matt Clarke had many interests, mourners heard at his funeral service in St Matthew’s Church in Richhill. Rev Gary McMurray told the congregation that his chief interest had probably been his garden, which was always immaculate, the result of hours outside working on his plants, and working in his greenhouse.“While Matthew enjoyed gardening, and growing things, perhaps his greatest pleasure was in sharing his produce with everyone - tomatoes and cucumbers chrysanthemums to brighten the homes of family and friends in winter cooking apples for tarts and crumbles at Hallowe’en his generosity and thoughtfulness was always evident, especially at Christmas,” he said.A dedicated member of the loyal orders, Matt Clarke was a member of Ballyleaney Purple Star LOL No , in which he had served as Worshipful Master, and District Master of Richhill, as well as serving on the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland.He joined the lodge in the early s and served as WM between  and , and a lodge spokesman said he would be greatly missed by the brethren.“He was a great man. He involved himself in everything to do with our lodge, even attended the five-a-side football tournaments which we have won seven out of the last  years, pool competitions and so on. He was an ever-present at the hall and will be sorely missed,” he said, adding: “Matt was a faithful and loyal Orangeman and he will be sorely missed by all within the Orange family.”In addition to serving as District Master of Richhill District LOL No , he was also a committee member of the Sir William Allen Fund, and as a member of the Grand Orange Lodge he worked on a number of committees. As a member of Grand Lodge he also worked on a number of committees, principally relating to Orange Hall and Orange Arch Insurance.Man remanded on murder charge over death of Belfast Community worker Ian Ogle Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"A keen lodge historian, he was instrumental in preserving one of the oldest private lodge minute books in existence his lodge, Ballyleaney Purple Star LOL No , found all their lodge minute books dating back to . In co-operation with the Grand Lodge, the oldest minute book was digitised and copies lodged with both Schomberg House and Sloan’s House Orange museums. Mr Clarke was also a member of the Royal Black Institution and the Apprentice Boys of Derry. He was a lelong member of St Matthew’s Church in Richhill. Interested in motorsports, he was an avid follower of Formula One on television and also attended the North-West  races each year.Despite his many interests, he was never happier than when he was spending time with his family, whether it was enjoying a takeaway at home or a holiday abroad.Following his retirement, Matt Clarke began to struggle with poor health in ious ways, but he was always brave, never complained, and did not let his challenges hold him back, still wanting to get up and out when he could.His family will remember him as someone who was at the very heart of the family and who loved having something to work on as well as enjoying a laugh and keeping up with all that was happening.His family thanked all the medical staff who cared for him at home, and also the staff in the Renal Unit at Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry. Thanks were also expressed for all those who came to the funeral to pay their respects.Following the funeral service, interment took place at Kilmore Parish Churchyard. Donations in lieu of flowers were encouraged to Kidney Care UK NI, made payable to Jackson Stoops  Sons, Funeral Directors,  Moy Road, Armagh BT DL.Mr Clarke is survived by his we Doreen, sons Colin and Neil, daughters-in-law Orla and Nichola, granddaughter Grace and his sister Eva and nephew John.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES:  things N.I. people do better than the English, Scottish and WelshRoad reopens after collisionMomo contacts N.I. man -

A consultation is being held on the councilrsquo website, while a drop-in session was held atSt Augustinersquos Parish Hall on January . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

The development connects to the entrance to Murch Road.After complaints from residents of vehicles tracking mud from the site across the nearby Murch Road, Barratt have promised to introduce improved wheel washing facilities.Plaid Cymru Community Councillor Chris Franks said residents had spoken to him to express their frustrations.He said: ldquoThe mud has splattered cars and made the whole area dirty.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cctv.jpg","title":"from cctv to gdpr the people keeping your business safe","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by John Mulgrew Ulster Business examines an ever-changing approach to business security and what companies are turning to in an increasingly digital age Is Big Brother watching you  For many, the idea of a society peppered with cameras and other forms of security harks back to the view of a dystopian Orwellian society. But with the UK having some of the highest levels of CCTV cameras in the world, businesses in particular are ensuring that both their physical security, along with digital and paper footprints, are protected. Angela Bennett, joint managing director of Belfast-based Diamond Systems says the role of the security system has evolved hugely in the last few years to become something of a capital investment. Offering more than surveillance, the new security systems we are using provide everything from analysis of the way a firm works to conventional protection. And she says an “ever-increasing” demand around health and safety in the workplace is encouraging more investment in reliable security that is as integral to a firm’s operations as its IT network. “Businesses now treat security systems as a capital investment in technology designed to ensure business continuity, monitor workflow processes, and help manage the ever-increasing demands around health and safety in the workplace,” Angela says. “We are seeing more reliance being placed on security systems, particularly CCTV, as an integral part of site safety management systems. Intelligent system design is essential at the outset of any CCTV project, to ensure adequate coverage and image usability, even in low light conditions.” There have been sophisticated advances in video camera technology in the last few years which have offered businesses new capabilities including motion detection that records only the things that matter, ‘heatmapping’ to determine where the most traffic flows in an area to people counting and unusual motion detection. These new abilities sht the former role of the CCTV camera to a new level, allowing it to file more information about the operations and trends in your business, and Angela agrees.  “CCTV is also being used as a value-added tool, where analytics are incorporated into the video management system ,” she says. “Software analytics are currently benefiting the retail sector for example, helping to plan store layouts, the locations for promotion points, and the forecasting of required staffing levels.” Increasingly sophisticated security also demands its own security, Angela says. “Businesses do however need to be aware of the emerging cyber risks associated with CCTV systems, and how to proactively address them. Choosing a specialist such as Diamond, will ensure that cyber risks are addressed at system design stage, and that systems installed are both future-proof and intelligent,” she says. Beyond CCTV other trends prevalent in business security include compliance with GDPR , cloud security, and articial intelligence and among the top trends for  will be a boost in heightened cloud security. Wikibon, the open source technology knowledge sharing community, projects that the cloud’s share of enterprise computing will grow from % currently to % by . “In terms of future trends, articial intelligence, sensor integration and environmental smart tech are all future demands that will shape the security industry’s offering,” Angela says. “Through partnerships with the leading global innovators, Diamond are at the forefront of this new technology and we will see change coming at a rapid pace over the next few years.” Headquartered in Lisburn with locations in Dublin, Limerick and London, Mercury Security  Facilities Management is a security firm and facilities management business. And according to boss Frank Cullen, the service it provides has transformed considerably since the company was formed back in . “In order for security companies to truly provide fit-for-purpose security solutions to clients, it is crucial that they move with the times – embracing advances in technology, adapting to changing legislation and understanding the changing nature of crime itself. “Cyber-security, in particular, has become a massive issue so the importance of a high degree of IT competence within your security company cannot be overstated. By their very nature, most security systems require external connections to the public internet and are therefore potentially vulnerable. So very good firewall protection must be employed and the support of a dedicated and knowledgeable IT department is essential.” Some of the firms specialising in cyber-security here include Sophos – a UK-based business which develops products for communication endpoint, encryption, network security and email security. And for the digital and hard copy, Belfast-based Morgan Document Security works with both the private and public sector around storing, archiving, retrieving documentation, records, legal papers and files. As with others, Mercury’s Frank Cullen says that the introduction of GDPR in May last year has had a “massive impact on security with signicantly increased financial penalties for companies that do not carefully protect the rights of iniduals – and this includes how CCTV images are handled and controlled”. While it is now very easy to provide managers with access to images on their mobile phones and portable devices, doing so could well mean that you would be breaking the lawvery carefully controlled procedures are not in place to protect the image data, how it is to be observed and by whom. “From a hardware point of view, it is important for security providers to have the competence and capability to assess potential manufacturers and their equipment at the most detailed of levels and to have awareness of the regulatory requirements in which they must work.” Elsewhere, there’s been some movement in other elements of the security business in Northern Ireland. Newtownabbey firm Environmental Street Furniturehas announced the acquisition of Co Down based specialist perimeter security company, Sentry Posts. Sentry Posts is a supplier of bollard systems, perimeter security and traffic products in Ireland. Since establishing in , the company has partnered with ATG Access, supplying prestigious projects including Arsenal Football Club’s Emirates Stadium, Wellington Arch in London, as well as the Europa Hotel and Charles Hurst and Trust Ford dealerships in Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/apartment_1.jpg","title":"belfast student accommodation plans revealed","story":"Posted on Tuesday March  by John Mulgrew The details of a new -bedroom student accommodation development for south Belfast have been revealed.
