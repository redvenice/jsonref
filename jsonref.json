My grandmother joined a knitting group in rural Nova Scotia. You started on washcloths, progressed to scarves then, if you were sufficiently adroit, you moved on to balaclavas and socks, and ultimately – the pinnacle! – to gloves. My grandmother was a terrible knitter. She never got beyond washcloths.I’ve often wondered about these knitting groups. What were they for, really? Were they providing much-needed knitted items, or were they boosting morale by giving a bunch of otherwise very anxious civilians, whose sons and husbands were in jeopardy, something to do with their hands while waiting, waiting, endlessly waiting? I can see the socks and gloves making it to the frontlines, but the washcloths? Photographs of muddy, cramped, stinky trench life don’t show much washing going on. And my grandmother’s wonky, hole-filled washcloths in particular – were they sent to a secret depot where they were unraveled, and their wool reclaimed for something more functional?So, in the spirit of my grandmother’s washcloths – not ultimately useful, perhaps, but let’s hope they focused the mind and gave a sense of accomplishment – I present some of my more bizarre self-isolation activities. You can do some of them at home. Though perhaps you won’t wish to.I won’t bother with the photo sorting, the purging of old files, the delving into storage trunks, the wonderment at some of the things found there – why did I save that, and what exactly is it? – or the reading of letters from boyfriends long gone now, or bald. I expect we are all doing something like that. Or the gardening, which would have happened anyway. Or the return to baking, something I used to do at industrial volume when there were teenagers around, and have made a tentative return to. Instead, I’ll move straight to the fire starters made from dryer lint, egg cartons and candle ends. Why should these clutter up landfill sites when you can make fire starters from them instead? The method was given to me by a group of female bush pilots who took me out to breakfast in Whitehorse, the Yukon, back in the 1990s, and I’ve been making them ever since. They are popular holiday gifts among certain of my easily pleased family members.Here’s what you do. Collect the lint from your dryer. Collect egg cartons, the cardboard variety. Collect candle ends. Stuff the lint into the pockets of the egg cartons. Melt the candle ends in a metal container kept for that purpose and set in a larger pan of boiling water. Do not melt them directly over an open flame. Pour the melted wax over the lint. When hardened, cut into cubes. To quote the bush pilots, who never took off for a flight into the trackless wilderness without some, just in case their plane went down: “Best damn fire starter you ever saw!”Another activity I’ve been doing lately is squirrel foiling. Hear a gnawing sound in the ceiling? These are your choices, in this part of the world: raccoons, possums, rats, squirrels, Google Earth. Probably squirrels, I thought, and so it proved to be. At first I foiled them by playing hot jazz and acid rock right under their gnawing station, but they got used to the wailing and screaming, so I climbed up a stepladder, placed a large steel bowl against the ceiling, and whacked it with a big metal serving spoon. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t have been doing that alone at night – the Younger Generation will scold when they read this – because people my age fall off ladders and break their necks, especially when not holding on because you need two hands for steel bowl banging. I won’t do it again, promise. (Until next time.)The hole having finally been located by the roofer – roofers can work at your house as long as they don’t come inside – I was able to climb out of a window on to a flat part of the roof and stuff the hole with hot pepper powder. (More hand-wringing by the Younger Gen, who kept saying: “Let me do it!” To which I replied: “You’re too big.” This was true – the Younger Gen tends to be taller, thanks to the postwar food glut of the 1950s – but the Younger Gen did help me get back in via a different stepladder. They have long arms.) End of squirrel gnawing. Don’t try this yourself. It’s not a recommendation. (Mad old grannies will do it anyway. I can’t stop them, and you won’t be able to either.)Not to worry. The pest guy came, and locked the squirrels out. Pest guys too (or pest gals) can work at your house as long as they don’t go into it.Those are my ersions. Now we’ll get down to the serious business: the remote events. These are multiplying like mice, since talks, festivals, fundraisers and shows that would once have been analogue, with real physical bodies gathered together in celebration and glee, quaffing, chattering, entertaining and applauding, have all been cancelled, and substitutes have had to be devised. Livestreams, videos, podcasts, radio interviews, FaceTime events in which you have to hold your phone at arms length from your face – all are swarming on to the internet, which has been crashing lately.Mary Beard, the two-fisted Cambridge classicist who understands crises, debacles and pandemics, being an authority on ancient Rome, asked me to do a remote item for the BBC Front Row Late show, which usually reviews theatre but now can’t because there isn’t any. “Just a little something,” she said, “as long as it’s on plagues.” This awakened the Kraken of my deep past – a childhood of reading horror literature, not only the Betty Crocker’s Picture Cookbook for proto-homemakers but also the collected work of Edgar Allan Poe. Who let that into the kiddie section of the library? Well, there isn’t any sex in it: that was probably the excuse and children are so fond of decaying corpses, especially those with all their teeth pulled out, as in “Berenice”. So me and “The Masque of the Red Death” go way back.Add to the mix my early career as a teenage puppeteer, and the fact that my baby sister, Ruth, and I had already watched all of the TV drama series Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries, and the devil found work for idle hands to do. We decided to stage “The Masque of the Red Death” using nothing but what could be found in the house. Out came the old Christmas wrapping paper and the saved-up bows and the stainless steel tableware. Prince Prospero is played by a champagne bottle, the courtiers by wine glasses, and the fortified abbey by the knives and forks. Never mind that you can’t go to the West End – you can watch “The Masque of the Red Death” instead. It’s amateur theatre at its most … at its most amateur.Then there was the hastily planned launch of the author-and-book show that will now be streamed regularly by the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, with Canadian authors presenting their spring-list books in one on the few locations available to them. My interlocutor was the honourable Adrienne Clarkson, a former governor general of Canada. We went to the University of Toronto at the same time in the late 50s and early 60s, though she went to Trinity, the Anglican college, and I to Victoria, founded by Methodists. They had gowns, we had moral earnestness. But Adrienne and I both studied  English language and literature, and what better match for a thrown-together online hour in which we discussed a lot of books we didn’t have and hadn’t read, but felt we would like to read? If university teaches you nothing else, it’s how to rabbit on about stuff you don’t actually know anything about. At one point my wifi froze and I had to go running around the house, holding up my device and looking for a signal. Just like the old days.On my plate now is the upcoming online bird extravaganza, a fun-packed substitute for two events we usually do in May at the height of the spring migration: SpringSong, on Pelee Island in the middle of Lake Erie, a stopover on a major flyway, and the Pelee Island Bird Observatory, the bird-banding and educational station on Pelee. We will try to recreate all the features of those two events, including the visiting authors, the Green Bird Race, and the Rubber Chicken Choir. As we’ll be streaming on Facebook Live, you can bring your own rubber chicken, wherever you are, and join in. I am the conductor.Meanwhile, my sister and her sewing machine are hurtling down the highway towards me at the speed of light well, not exactly, but faster than usual due to the scarcity of cars on the road. I have dug out my own ancient sewing machine, and after I’ve oiled it and figured out how to work it again, we are going to sew face masks for health workers. I’ve even found some elastic, in short supply on the ground these days: there must be a lot of face mask sewing going on. The result may be like my grandmother’s washcloths – not perfect, lopsided, but well meant. And, with hope, they will also be functional. Fingers crossed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47e0c1fe593617e18d14a33d0b1a319e8e6aad7/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=247856ced2d26f38da3a8ef5e495f0f7","title":"ey ordered pay whistleblower 11m dubai gold audit case","story":"Court rules accountancy firm breached code of ethics in its dealings with a refinerA former partner at the accounting firm EY has been awarded $10.8m (£8.6m) in damages after being forced out of his job when he exposed professional misconduct during an audit of a Dubai gold refiner.The high court in London ruled on Friday that EY had repeatedly breached the code of ethics for professional accountants in its dealings with one of its clients, Kaloti Jewellery International.The claim was brought by Amjad Rihan, who revealed that silver-coated gold had been shipped from Morocco to avoid export restrictions and precious metal obtained from other countries such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iran without due diligence.After telling EY about his concerns, Rihan was ordered back to Dubai but feared for his and his family’s safety. He resigned and subsequently made whistleblowing disclosures in 2014.Mr Justice Kerr found EY had breached its duty to Rihan through failing to perform the Kaloti audit in an ethical and professional manner.The court awarded Rihan a total of $10,843,941 and £117,950 in sterling for damages for past and future loss of earnings, and loss of employment benefits.After the ruling, Rihan said: “Almost seven years of agony for me and my family has come to an end with a total vindication by the court. My life was turned upside down as I was cruelly and harshly punished for insisting on doing my job ethically, professionally and lawfully in relation to the gold audits in Dubai.“The court ruled in my favour and found that EY breached its duties towards me, for which I am very grateful. I hope that EY uses this judgment as an opportunity to improve and take the necessary measures to avoid anything like this ever happening again.”Paul Dowling, a solicitor from law firm Leigh Day who represented Rihan, said: “For years EY has refused to admit any wrongdoing in relation to the Kaloti audit. Instead it accused Mr Rihan of being a liar and a fantasist. Our client’s character and actions have now been completely vindicated by the court.“By contrast it is EY which has been found to have committed serious professional misconduct at the highest echelons of the organisation. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.In his judgment, Kerr said: “Gold is used in the banking industry, for investment purposes in the jewellery industry and in the electronics industry, for manufacturing. It is recognised internationally as being among the ‘conflict minerals’ attractive to criminals and terrorists because it is relatively easy to move and holds its value well.“For these reasons, the importance of good due diligence and regulation in the gold refining industry and other ‘conflict minerals’ trading is emphasised in guidance published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in US legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The claimant and his colleagues at EY Dubai and EY MENA saw this as an opportunity to acquire fruitful work producing assurance reporting to gold refiners in Dubai and elsewhere in the region. Kaloti was the most substantial of the Dubai refiners, with the largest market share.”Commenting on the Morocco transactions, Kerr said: “I accept as a fact that the defendants were responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue, removing the reference to Morocco and changing the coating of gold bars with silver to documentary irregularities. I regard this as professional misconduct.”An EY spokesperson said: “We are surprised and disappointed by the judge’s decision, its introduction of an unprecedented legal duty and its financial award to a former EY Dubai partner. We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail. It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16d0a4579e9df28986d8a49e4b7c0084222ce4f/0_84_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f29f4e2cfbcb330796ec6a26b6da65e","title":"us airlines empty planes coronavirus environment","story":"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.“The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.” A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”."},{"url":null,"title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

And yet they’re still likely to win another electionNext month the Conservatives will have been in power for 10 years. British parties who manage that anniversary are usually unpopular by the time it comes.In 1989, Margaret Thatcher’s government lost its poll lead for good. By 2007 Tony Blair was no longer a dominant premier. Accumulating mistakes, personal burn-out, the difficulty of finding fresh goals and voters’ boredom with the status quo all usually ensure that even parties with able leaders weaken and fall from power after three or four terms. To a large extent, the UK’s traditional sense of itself as a erse, healthy democracy depends on it.Yet recently our revered political pendulum seems to have stopped swinging. Last year, the Tories won their fourth consecutive general election, by a far larger margin than the others. Since then, their poll lead has swollen further. They are widely expected to win a fifth election, whenever it comes. No British party has done that since the early 1800s.This Tory ascendancy has been maintained despite a record in office since 2010 that is arguably worse than those of the UK’s most infamous modern governments, the overwhelmed Conservative and Labour administrations of the 1970s. The Tories have called and lost the EU referendum, pushed Scotland and Northern Ireland towards leaving the UK, pursued austerity policies that hugely damaged public services and society – without reducing government debt as promised – and presided over the worst wage growth for two centuries. Now they appear to be mishandling coronavirus catastrophically. Labour has never been allowed to forget its smaller failure to halt the winter of discontent, more than 40 years ago, when strikes notoriously delayed the burial of some people who had died of natural causes. After coronavirus, Britain may associate the Conservatives with far worse horrors. But that is not happening yet. Surveys show some mild public disapproval of their performance during the crisis. Yet there remains a general acceptance that, for the foreseeable future, for good or ill, the Tories will be our masters. Such feelings can be self-fulfilling. In 1954, the French sociologist Maurice Duverger wrote: “A dominant party is that which public opinion believes to be dominant.”And Boris Johnson’s administration seems to be seeking a more complete dominance than previous British governments. It demands compliance rather than frankness from Whitehall. It excludes critical journalists from official briefings. It avoids scrutiny by parliament: the Commons has sat for one full month in Johnson’s first 10 as premier. Meanwhile, the Tories have repeatedly claimed to represent “the people”, as if no other party can.In all these ways, the UK may be moving closer to becoming a one-party state. Not a totalitarian one, but a democratic one, like postwar Italy or Japan, where one party is in power for decades, on its own or in coalitions, absorbing ideas and policies from rival parties, shamelessly moving rightwards or leftwards according to circumstances, and winning the pragmatic support of ever more interest groups. The life of a single party – its ideological trajectory, factional struggles and leadership contests – becomes almost the whole of politics.For some voters, one-party democracy is a relief. It saves them having to think much about politics, from having to evaluate other parties. Last year’s Tory victory owed a lot to this impulse: voting in a third general election in four years, some people were tired of having to consider Labour’s alternatives, and settled for what they knew.In the UK, one-party democracy does exist in non-Tory forms – thanks to devolution policies enacted by Labour. Wales has been continuously governed by Labour (sometimes in coalitions) since 1999, Scotland by the SNP since 2007. And concerns about the UK’s tendency to produce democratic monocultures pre-date the present Tory era. Twenty years ago, under Blair, the political scientist Colin Crouch coined the phrase “post-democracy” to describe the contraction of electoral politics to “a small range of issues”, selected “by rival teams of professionals”, while more fundamental questions were settled in private by big business and deferential politicians.In one sense, our democracy is healthier now. Labour and the Tories disagree much more profoundly than they did during the Blair years – voters have a proper choice. But in other ways, what we have now is worse: a political system dominated not by “professionals” – New Labour’s bland but often competent and hard-working ministers – but by amateurish Tory figures.Will this one-party democracy last? Parliament finally returns next week. The government’s clear failures over coronavirus continue. Labour has a prosecutor for a new leader. And the Tories, for all their electoral supremacy, still look ill-equipped to deal with the crises that will return to prominence after coronavirus: over the climate, the viability of modern capitalism, and how to create a society that works for all age groups, rather than mainly the old and middle-aged. These questions are likely to be too isive to be settled inside one party.When the Conservative era eventually ends, it may do so spectacularly. As many dictators and long-serving premiers have discovered, there’s one big problem for practitioners of one-party rule. When the public finally decide that you’ve failed to deliver, there’s no one else to blame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d52e7792cc11526de475e3dfafa2cf989f36ed9b/0_62_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b8525a8c8be0fa11cdec1cabaf6ad38","title":"ellen degeneres be kind what that means","story":"Recently, and not for the first time, the comedian’s public persona has appeared to be at odds with her private actionsSign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter​ on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.“Be kind” Ellen DeGeneres says at the end of every episode of her eponymous show. There’s a BE KIND Ellen hat. A BE KIND wine tote. A BE KIND subscription box. There are even BE KIND face masks – so you can try killing the coronavirus with kindness.Shockingly, it seems that DeGeneres might not always practice what she preaches: crew members on her talkshow are reportedly furious over the not-so-kind way they’ve been treated during the coronavirus crisis. According to Variety, the core stage crew for the Ellen DeGeneres Show are frustrated that they haven’t received written communication about the status of their hours or pay. They were also less than thrilled to discover, via social media, that an outside, non-union, tech company had been hired to help DeGeneres film her show remotely from her home. This stung as DeGeneres had recently announced on-air that she wanted to start filming again as soon as possible so she could support her staff and crew.DeGeneres isn’t personally responsible for every aspect of how her show is run, of course. But it certainly seems like a woman who is reportedly worth more than $330m and is one of the highest-paid stars on television, earning more than $50m a year, could be doing rather more to support the people who work under her. Particularly as many of her crew have worked on the show since it started 17 years ago. It’s worth noting that Jimmy Kimmel Live! stagehands, according to Variety, were paid from Kimmel’s own pocket during initial coronavirus shutdowns.Why is DeGeneres suddenly getting so much backlash and bad press? Well, for one thing, coronavirus has made us all sick to death of celebrity shenanigans. It’s hard for stars to seem relatable when they’re moaning about their mansions.More broadly, however, I think some of the animosity towards DeGeneres has to do with the way she exemplifies the hypocrisy around the concept of “civility”. Last year, for example, DeGeneres lectured us all on her friendship with George W Bush, a man who opposed same-sex marriage and whose own former counter-terrorism chief accused him of committing war crimes. “When I say, ‘Be kind to one another’, I don’t mean only the people who think the same way that you do,” DeGeneres said on her show, in response to criticism of her hobnobbing with Bush. “I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn’t matter.”I don’t want to completely slam DeGeneres. She’s done a lot of good in the world. It’s hard to overstate how brave it was for her to come out in 1997 her courage made life a lot easier for the next generation of queer people. According to a 2015 poll, Ellen did more to influence Americans’ attitudes about gay rights than any other celebrity or public figure. But if she wants to keep flogging merchandise with BE KIND on it, then she might want to start thinking a little harder about what those words actually mean. And I say that in the kindest possible way.Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a project that records the killing of women by men, has identified at least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed. The same period last year saw an average of five deaths. “The number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest it’s been for at least 11 years and is double that of an average 21 days over the last 10 years,” Smith said.“Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so,” the first daughter recently tweeted. Ivanka then flew from Washington DC to the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey to celebrate Passover.Laura Daniel, a New Zealand comedian, attempted to create Jacinda Ardern in cake form during a baking competition as a tribute to the prime minister. Let’s just say that the final result wasn’t exactly flattering. “Don’t bake your heroes,” Daniel advised.“A British woman in a long-term relationship with a 92-year-old German chandelier has been told that her attraction to historic light fittings is not considered to be a protected sexual orientation,” the  reports. Some light relief in these dark times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b8a098f1908c315f1aa62a1f5e974ab9b7d382c/0_312_5210_3128/master/5210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2b0a47107d1f17c576d5fbd945cc7f1","title":"germany ease lockdown harder","story":"Relaxation measures for schools have been criticised from all sidesThe coronavirus has been kind to Germany’s political elite. After years of bleeding votes to the Alternative für Deutschland on the right and the Greens on the left, Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union has finally started to see rising approval ratings. It’s easy to see why. The country’s lockdown was enacted relatively swiftly and presented clearly, its testing programme has been unparalleled in the western world and its healthcare system has proven far more robust than those of neighbouring countries. Now, however, with the virus seemingly in retreat and parts of Europe tentatively easing out of lockdown, tensions are beginning to show, and Germans may soon look back on the quarantine with a kind of nostalgia.The government has emphasised repeatedly that the relaxation of the measures is provisional and that continued progress will require the development of sophisticated contact-tracing programmes, including the controversial suggestion that smartphones be used in a widespread programme to track interactions between citizens. The “fragile partial success,” Merkel has insisted, can only hold if the population continues to abide by social distancing regulations as much as possible.The plan to reopen some shops has been largely greeted with muted relief, though there doesn’t seem to be much hope that it will stimulate the economy more broadly. The plan for reopening schools has been roundly criticised. The Leopoldina’s guidelines for maintaining social distance and proper hygiene at schools are “just not realistic,” as Ilke Hoffmann, the head of the education union, Gewerkschaft Erzeihung und Wissenschaften, told Der Spiegel. There aren’t enough teachers to maintain class sizes of 15 students or less, as the report suggests, and classrooms are far too small to maintain a two-metre distance between students. Furthermore, the report’s claim that older primary school students would be able to abide by social distancing strictures has been roundly criticised, with teachers calling the idea a fantasy. Harriet Kühnemann, the director of a primary school in Gießen, Hesse, told NTV that she “absolutely cannot guarantee that students will wash their hands”.While plans to reopen primary schools have been criticised for moving too quickly, the Leopoldina’s recommendation that nurseries stay closed until the end of the summer break in August or September has been widely condemned as too restrictive. The theologian and ethicist Peter Dabrock, for example, has said the decision endangers the wellbeing of children. Closing daycare for six months, Dabrock told Deutschland Funk, would constitute “a massive violation of the rights of children”. Heinz Holger, the president of the Deutschen Kinderschutzbundes, a child welfare organisation, warned that such a long closure had already led to increased calls to their domestic violence hotline. Parental groups, meanwhile, have pointed out that many families already face enormous financial difficulty due to the lack of childcare.The inept recommendations of the Leopoldina can hardly be surprising given its membership. The panel that issued the report consisted of 24 men and two women. The average age of its members was over 60. One wonders how the institution arrived at the conclusion that it was more important to include a physicist specialising in the “mechanics of materials” than experts on the experiences of immigrants, people of colour, or women. Professor Jutta Allmendinger, a member of the Leopoldina (though not a signatory of its report), had no trouble in assembling a more erse group of signatories to an open letter criticising the report – more than 40 female professors from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds have signed the letter calling for daycare centres to be opened more quickly.As the burden of the coronavirus begins to be distributed more and more unevenly, and as women and the young are forced to bear more and more of the weight of the crisis, one suspects that many Germans will look with bitter envy towards Denmark, whose prime minister, Mette Friedriksen – a 42-year-old mother – has made early childhood education the first priority as the country emerges from lockdown. Denmark’s experts have concluded that it is not the young but the elderly who should bear the burden of social isolation during the remainder of the pandemic. The very young, who are generally not at risk from the virus, should not have to sacrifice important educational opportunities so that those who belong to at-risk groups can return to public life more quickly. It’s no coincidence that Germany, in contrast, is keeping the youngest children in isolation, while hair salons and department stores are being allowed to reopen. Ending lockdown is not an end in itself, as the German government has made clear, but even getting that right in a country that has excelled so far is proving to be harder than imagined.• Peter Kuras is a writer and translator based in Berlin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a648b31556502880fca669c97db219e3cab97504/0_219_6568_3941/master/6568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee3f9d8f01b56c861c746b347203b08","title":"me a domestic goddess no i just like a clean house","story":"Joanna Trollope is wrong to turn housework into some kind of battle between the sexesAnybody felt deeply fulfilled while cleaning the lavatory lately? No, me neither.Where to start? Ms Trollope seems to be arguing that women perceive the “domestic domain” as some Game of Thrones-type scenario, where they perch on giant dragons, refusing to give up their kingdom. At home, we hiss, spit and plot to undermine our emotionally castrated menfolk in order to pursue our sacred lady-calling, to… what exactly: stick a wash on, mop the kitchen? I’m sure most women agree that we can think of far better things to get “emotionally ambitious” or even “controlling” about.This is the central insult embedded in most discussions about housework: that women give a hot damn, that feminine identity is entwined in something as dreary as dragging around a vacuum cleaner. It requires discussion only because, even today, it remains a gendered tinderbox of unfairness and grievance. Not just that (it can also be about class and society), but which gender is lumbered with most housework (take a wild guess) remains a useful barometer of true equality in the home.It’s surely clearer than ever right now (with us all jammed in together) that mythologising housework is a mug’s game. It is essentially about practicality, not emotions or power-plays. In my experience, most women don’t orgasm while cleaning loos, process emotional pain as they polish taps or feel omnipotent as they change duvet covers. Just like a man, they’ll think a job needs doing, so they do it.The biggest lie ever told to women – and about women – is that they find domestic chores any more interesting, fulfilling or defining than men do. As Trollope must herself have noticed (having her own oeuvre summed up by a domestic appliance), women are only diminished by such a false and reductive view. No one in their right mind would scheme and manipulate to do more housework. Women are generally happy for men to control and dominate in this boring and repetitive “domain”.Knock yourselves out, guys, we’ll be lying on the sofa, surfing Netflix, chucking down chocolate biscuits, feeling all sad and disenfranchised.Anyone want to take a bite out of New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern? She’s now available in cake form, but you’d need to be exceptionally hungry and desperate.Comedian and television presenter Laura Daniel has said she’s “deeply sorry” to Ardern after an attempt to pay tribute to her in cake form went awry. Daniel was responding to the challenge of making a cake without flour, depicting a New Zealand icon, and posting it on Instagram. At first glance, the cake resembles the creature that climbed out of the well in The Ring, but closer inspection reveals it to be so much more than that, while simultaneously managing to be so much less.Based on Ardern’s cover shot for the biography, An Extraordinary Leader, the cake is anything but ordinary. The ghostly pale icing is smeared on as if in some confused baking-themed “dirty protest”. There are blackly dribbling eyebrows and lank liquorice strands of hair. The nose is a slightly bigger dollop of icing. Blue eyes stare out horribly. The representation of Ardern’s red top makes it appear as if the cake has had its throat slit. The daubed lips say “Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker just found your lipstick”. And what Daniel’s cake lacks in flour it makes up for in realistic teeth.Never mind apologising, Daniel should be congratulated – this must be the first cake to say: “Eat me… before I eat you.” While Ardern has been applauded for her leadership during the coronavirus outbreak, Daniel has also provided a valuable public service. With people in the UK and across the world taking up lockdown baking, her cake is a masterclass in what not to do. People can take comfort in the fact that, however dodgy their baking, it will never be as bad as Daniel’s.Obviously it’s vitally important to observe the lockdown. Still, are some people taking their surveillance duties a little too seriously, to the point where a citizen’s arrest culture is sprouting?Large numbers of people are tipping off the police about neighbours or challenging people in public spaces. In the main, fair enough – I’ve also felt like saying something when heavy-breathing desperadoes jog past, splashing sweat around. And, sorry young people, you shouldn’t be meeting to enthusiastically snog on park benches.However, while social policing has to happen, does there need to be so much of it when it comes to minor infractions? Occasionally, it’s necessary to report someone to the police, or have a word in public, and sometimes it really isn’t. It seems perfectly possible to, say, pass someone sitting alone on their coat in the park, or two people standing far apart having a brief chat, without erupting in righteous rage and laying down the law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0b9ffc39b44379a6d0564ff1610a5baec89264/0_139_3087_1852/master/3087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de05fbb405d397e8bfbd869b91305509","title":"what mrs america gets right and what it gets wrong about 70s feminism","story":"Mrs America gives Phyllis Schlafly a depth in fiction that was lacking in history but Shirley Chisholm is refreshingly portrayed as more than just a martyrThe real hero of Mrs America, the new FX miniseries chronicling the early 1970s political battle over the Equal Rights Amendment, is Phyllis Schlafly. Schlafly, the conservative movement leader who led the antifeminist backlash against the amendment, styled herself a housewife and mother of six, but really she was an educated, driven and ambitious professional political operator, skilled in forging alliances among unlikely counterparts and manipulating the motivations of others toward her own ends.In the miniseries, a slick, beautifully shot portrait of 1970s America, she is played by Cate Blanchett, who masterfully shows Schlafly finding an outlet for her own frustrated political ambitions in the anti-ERA fight, and rising from a minor conservative commentator on the lunatic fringe to the primary voice of social conservatism on the national stage. As the ERA is defeated – going from a bipartisan shoo-in that sailed through the Senate to an embattled, controversial document that meets resistance in every statehouse – the show encourages us to see the downfall of the major political effort of the second wave feminist movement as the result, paradoxically, of one woman’s phenomenal personal determination.The realities of history were a bit more complicated than that. Though Schlafly was the face of the conservative opposition to the ERA, the show depicts her as that movement’s instigator and sole intellectual origin, with male politicians and movement conservatives shruggingly falling into line behind her. The show depicts her, too, as having resentments about male arrogance and entitlement in her own life, a strain of her character that is meant to draw parallels between Schlafly and the feminist leaders she opposes, such as Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan and Shirley Chisholm. We see the women on either side of the ideological ide smarting at the pains of their own thwarted ambitions, and enduring sexual aggression from men for the sake of achieving their goals: Schlafly wanted to be a congresswoman Chisholm wanted to be president Steinem wanted to pass a law through Congress legalizing abortion rights.None of them got what they wanted. In one scene, Schlafly, contemplating a second run for Congress, lets a slimy Washington insider squeeze her waist and make a lewd comment about her dress later, rage flashes across her face when men in a meeting ask her to take notes for them. She steps out of the office and snaps at the young secretary instead. In the offices of Ms Magazine, Steinem lets the publisher make a gross remark about her legs, because she needs his money to keep it in print.These moments are meant to endear Schlafly to viewers, and at the same time to make sure that the show’s politics are clear: despite who the protagonist is, Mrs America is ultimately on the feminists’ side. But these attempts to draw parallels between Schlafly’s ambitions and anger and that of the feminists risks reducing the differences between them to the temperamental or circumstantial, rather than the ideological and political.In real life, Schlafly was not so conflicted. Though her public life and fierce style conflicted tellingly with her prescriptions for women’s behavior, such as modesty, domesticity and obedience, she was a fierce misogynist who wrote and testified passionately that women who experienced sexual harassment brought men’s aggression on themselves. The show is a bit too generous to Schlafly here, and one can’t help but think that it is trying to make its subject worthy of its casting: Blanchett, in a stunning performance, is too skilled and nuanced an actor to play a figure of such uncomplicated contempt as Schlafly herself really was. Mrs America gives Schlafly a depth in fiction that was not there in history.Though Schlafly remains the central figure, the show attempts to treat its other women with interest and generosity as the fight around the ERA progresses through the politically hectic summer of 1972. Gloria Steinem, played willowy and glamorous by Rose Byrne, has become the face of the feminist movement, but she is torn between the cantankerous, uncompromising idealism of Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman) and the appeasing, results-focused pragmatism of Bella Azbug (Margo Martindale).In the early scenes with Steinem, as she launches Ms Magazine and attempts to harness her considerable media appeal in the service of Shirley Chisholm’s presidential bid, the show veers towards portraying Steinem as a victim of her own celebrity and good looks – another historical mistake, as in reality Steinem was a savvy and deliberate manipulator of these. But as the show progresses, the script veers from underestimating Steinem to seeing her more clearly, as she attempts, in vain but with the best of intentions, to manipulate a corrupt political system to admirable political ends.But the show’s real triumph is the actor Uzo Aduba, criminally underrated and radiant as Shirley Chisholm. Fraught, frustrated, paranoid and betrayed at the end of her presidential bid, Chisholm is portrayed not as the one-dimensional martyr that feminist history so often makes her, but as an earnest, principled advocate who suffers deep pain at the racist and sexist determination of those around her to underestimate and overlook her talents. Her presidential bid, and her unwillingness to end it as the 1972 Democratic national convention in Miami nears, causes a conflict among the feminists between pragmatism and potential, the dream of a free world with rights and dignity for all women and the need to get results to alleviate the ongoing suffering of sexism. The choices they make, and the way Chisholm herself responds, reveal that this is a false choice, and a trap. Still, when her friends abandon her and her presidential campaign is forced to fold, we can see her pain and disappointment. Her principle and idealism is not depicted in simplistic terms as pure or morally aspirational, but also as tragic, and very lonely. The show gives Chisholm and its viewers a great deal of respect here, by taking her suffering seriously.Mrs America sets out to show history as made by human beings, complete with insecurities, hopes, relatable fears and bad motivations. In this sense, it is not unlike other political dramas that have attempted to depict the agents of power and politics as relatable, familiar and human. In some of its scenes, where women in colorful 70s garments and elaborate hairdos exchange banter while walking briskly through the halls of power, the show can feel a bit like Aaron Sorkin’s The West Wing, though it is a great deal worldlier and more skeptical. Mrs America is not the first show to explore history as a mosaic of human egotism, hopefulness and frailty. But it is one of the first where history is made by the egotism, hopefulness and frailties of women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6dcfbfdf34b3d03fc5927d4da1a1efe90f4bc72/0_85_4954_2973/master/4954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7085641c463b2b879d55721f1b7a672","title":"after coronavirus a no deal brexit cartoon","story":"The government has said it will refuse any request to extend the transition•You can buy your own print of this cartoon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53bbd5044449a2943f83a8f9b024c1d6e097cf81/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3427310f220ec04ad23541c85166312","title":"opportunity knocks how lockdown is opening doors for new creative talent","story":"Aspiring writers and directors now have a rare chance to impress producers and publishers with time on their handsCameras have stopped rolling, book launches are postponed and actors are all “resting”. It looks as if nothing is moving in the world of entertainment and storytelling, yet from Hollywood to the major the publishing houses of London and New York, the talent scouts and production companies are working overtime to complete unfinished projects and find new tales to tell.The frenzy of backroom activity is creating unusual opportunities for novice stars of the future. For once, aspiring writers and wannabe directors are in demand.“We are scouring the internet looking for cool short films,” said Aram Tertzakian, co-founder of Santa Monica-based XYZ Films, the company behind Welsh director Gareth Evans’s recent action hits The Raid and Apostle. “We’ve been going back to filmmakers we have worked with before as well, like Gareth, and developing new projects with them. If we are nimble, then we can get them up and running before the other content providers gear up again.”While producers are prospecting for talent they would not normally have had time to find nor develop, half-finished films and dramas are using CGI and other special effects to complete projects at speed.Finding the raw material, the best new writing for books and filmed drama, is also being prioritised. Literary scouts, agents and publishers say they are reading more and looking ahead.“We have been busy, as there is quite a lot of action out there,” said literary scout Catherine Eccles, of Eccles Fisher Associates. “It is really lively and major buyers, like Amazon, Disney and Netflix, are calling and saying ‘what have you got?’ They’ve had to close down their productions, so are putting everything into development. And, of course, subscriptions have spiked, so they have the money, too.”Recent experience has shown the biggest hits, television shows such as Killing Eve or Stranger Things, can come from unknown writers. As a result, Independent Talent Group, one of the leading entertainment agencies, has urged its agents to get to imaginative writers before the competition does.Eccles has also seen an altered emphasis in her work with clients in 20 countries. “There is quite a bit of corona-writing going on, of course,” she said. “Some publishers are being opportunistic, rushing out lockdown-inspired work, but generally agents are looking for something fresh.”The reception of XYZ’s latest hit, Vivarium, directed by Irishman Lorcan Finnigan and starring Jesse Eisenberg, has benefited from the way its theme of incarceration chimes with audience experience but, on the whole, Tertzakian believes lockdown is not affecting his search for new stories. “Peoples tastes won’t change, but their viewing habits already have. They are used to watching high quality content at home and this will accelerate that. Our bet has always been on smart genre, that is sci-fi, horror and action.”And if there is a sheaf of typed pages in your bottom drawer, now is the time to send in that screenplay or manuscript.“At HarperCollins, we’re still actively looking for new submissions and the lack of commute has given some people more time to read,” said Phoebe Morgan, an editor at HarperFiction, who signed up a new author this month.“At Avon HarperCollins we’re hosting an online book festival, and telling everyone that tunes in that we’re now open to unsolicited manuscripts. In other words, you do not have to have a literary agent to be able to submit.”The company has also opened up its website so that authors can send in work directly. Signing a new author, to be published next year by HarperFiction, “was a lovely moment and a bright spot of positivity in a difficult time,” said Morgan. “We want new content and a full, exciting list for 202122, when this is all over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26fe6c7f86b889d385b35f1ffbd05df5035a60cd/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eea6e1c8da508881fb1f77af29054619","title":"british workers reject fruit picking jobs as romanians flown in coronavirus","story":"Contract length, farm location and caring duties cited as reasons for turning down workThousands of British workers who responded to a nationwide appeal to help pick fruit and vegetables on farms have rejected job offers, it has emerged.The Alliance of Ethical Labour Providers said it had received 36,000 applications of interest but only 6,000 had opted for an interview for a role.Concordia, one of the three recruitment companies in the alliance, said: “To date 900 people have explicitly rejected the roles we have offered and 112 have taken up our offer of a role on a UK farm.”It said the main barriers were the length of the contract, location of the farm, and inability to work full-time because of care responsibilities.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.“Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can be full time for eight weeks and some can be up to six months,” said Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops.She said that even though they were not able to hire all who applied, she felt there was an education process under way about farm work that could have a lasting impact after Brexit, when Conservative party plans will put a block on low-paid and low-skilled workers coming to the UK from abroad.“We are so pleased to see so many people apply and so thankful they have responded to the call to support agriculture in this country and we appreciate their patience as some of the crops are not yet ready and new offers will be going out,” she said, adding that peak recruitment would not really start till the end of May for most farms.Several people who said they had responded to the government-backed appeal complained about the barriers to taking up the posts, particularly the on-site accommodation.One man who contacted the , who lives in Norfolk and wanted to commute to a job locally, where there are many farms, said: “Some of the jobs require you to live on-site. It doesn’t make it easy at all. If we really need to be picking all these vegetables, they don’t make it very easy. I can’t move I have a family.”Gary Leshone, 35, who used to work in fishing in Grimsby, launched his own personal recruitment drive when the national Feed the Nation appeal, backed by the environment secretary, George Eustice, was launched three weeks ago.He managed to get 150 volunteers who were willing to cross the country to Herefordshire and to live on-site for six months.“I contacted farmers inidually and initially I was told by one farmer he’d take as many workers as he could get, so I went on radio and social media and got 150 people. I know I could probably find 1,000 to 2,000 here because people are out of work.”He was then told by the farmer that he needed a gangmaster’s licence if he was going to place that many workers on the market, which he was told would take 10 weeks to obtain.“By that time the fruit and veg will have rotted and the borders will probably be reopened,” he said.Underlining the confused messaging surrounding the sudden recruitment drive, Hops pointed out that the Gangmaster and Labour Abuse Authority was doing checks and handing out gangmaster licences within five days because of the crisis.“The Romanians coming in are just like us, looking for work to feed their families themselves, but if they need 90,000 people and you have all these British people unemployed and the government has to pay out universal credit, it’s just ridiculous. The government should do more to sort this out,” said Leshone.Recruiters appealed for patience among British hopefuls, pointing out that the peak season started from May and there would be “thousands of roles available for people who are in need of a job”.There was controversy in Romania after photographs emerged of crowds gathering in regional airports for flights to Germany, which, like the UK, is also suffering a labour deficit. Questions are being asked in Romania as to how workers could leave to help ease other countries’ demand for fresh food when much of Romania is in strict lockdown.G’s Fresh, one of the UK’s biggest salad growers, which has chartered two of the six planes from Bucharest, said it had recruited 500 British workers so far.“We’re really pleased with how the recruitment campaign is going, but it is important that we have got these people from Romania. These are key skilled workers who were with us last year. We need experienced people who can make sure everyone is safe and knows what to do,” Beverley Dixon, the company’s HR director, told Eastern Daily Press.Romanian workers travelling to the UK were given masks and sanitiser before boarding and would be be quarantined in small teams before full deployment, G’s Fresh said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe12f65605d563fef03ac97336034c67be449354/0_10_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad60d460222af118c28945df8722eb21","title":"covid 19 a blessing for pangolins","story":"Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammals, but there is evidence that they were the source of the new coronavirus – which could end the trade Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats.There are eight species of pangolin. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Two of the African species are considered vulnerable and two are endangered. Of the Asian species, one is endangered while the other three are critically endangered.Pangolins are illegally hunted and traded for two main reasons. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine. As a result, they are the world’s most trafficked mammals.However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. Many pointed the finger at bats: the virus is genetically similar to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans. There was also a study linking the virus to one found in snakes, but this is now considered unlikely.However, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, China announced an immediate ban on trading and eating many wild animals, including pangolins. Officials began shutting down wild animal markets across the country.This was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned by the 183 nations that signed up to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible.However, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says Xu Ling, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. The trade continues but the nature of the shipments has changed. “Before 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,” says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being illicitly shipped out via Nigeria.More recently, in August 2019, China’s state insurance providers announced that they would stop covering medicines made from pangolin scales. The move took effect in January 2020.Against this background, it is unclear what impact China’s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. “Even without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,” says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, as so often happens, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market.Meanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away.“It’s pretty clear the bat serves as the reservoir for this,” says Andersen. The question is how the virus travelled from bats to humans. “We are entertaining two different scenarios.”The key question is how the virus acquired certain sequences of its genome, which allow it to bind strongly to human cells and thus infect them. The bat virus does not have these sequences.One possibility is that the bat virus made the jump to humans several months before the outbreak was detected. These early viruses would not have been especially infectious or dangerous, but they could have mutated and evolved to acquire the key genetic sequences that made them infectious.The alternative possibility is that there was an intermediate host. “That’s where the pangolins come in,” says Andersen. While the pangolin virus as a whole is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, the pangolin virus genome does have the crucial binding sequences. This is what Shen, Xiao and their colleagues found – and it has now been supported by a further study from another Chinese group.Furthermore, a study published on 26 March in Nature discovered viruses closely related to Sars-CoV-2 in pangolins that had been smuggled into China. These viruses had binding sequences similar to those in the human viruses.“Where it’s really important is where they’re identical,” says Andersen. “While the bat virus overall is more similar, in the regions where it really matters it’s actually quite different.”This suggests that the bat and pangolin viruses met, perhaps in the same host, and exchanged genes. Some of the bat viruses ended up with the key binding sequences from the pangolin viruses, enabling them to infect humans and unleash a pandemic. “Recombination is frequent in these types of viruses,” says Andersen. “It’s speculative, but it’s highly likely that that’s how we ended up with this new virus.”A similar story played out before the Sars outbreak of 2002-2004. The original source of the virus was wild bats, and in 2017 researchers managed to identify a cave in China where the bats carry viruses that are virtually identical to Sars. However, the virus was probably passed to humans via civets, which are cat-like animals, leading to China imposing a temporary ban on selling civets. The more recent Mers outbreak probably moved from bats to humans via camels.However, says Andersen, we cannot yet be sure which scenario is correct. Even if there was an intermediate host, it may not have been pangolins.The question of whether pangolins contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak will not be settled any time soon. “It’s probably going to be a long, drawn-out question,” says Andersen. Resolving the origin of Sars took years.But it may be crucial to ending the pangolin trade, because doing so requires two things. The first is strict enforcement of the rules, which China seems to want to do – it was stepping up enforcement even before the outbreak. The second is for people to stop buying pangolin products. If there is no demand, the illegal trade will become unprofitable, and suppliers will abandon it.“Just the fact there’s been all this publicity about the potential link to pangolins will probably lead to plummeting demand for them,” says Richard Thomas, head of communications at Traffic in Cambridge.The realisation that wildlife markets allow diseases to spread to people may spur action. When China announced the ban, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called it “a timely, necessary and critical step” – not just for safeguarding the wild animals, but for human health. “This public health crisis must serve as a wake-up call to end the unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, whether as exotic pets, for food consumption or for their perceived medicinal value.”In the best-case scenario, it will not just be pangolins that benefit. Reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife will help many species – and protect us all from future pandemics into the bargain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30fd36188d47ef9939722a82406468db0dc4d368/0_0_3400_2038/master/3400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c50966cacd95c39ff21af02c80f17fac","title":"10 things the lockdown has taught me about food","story":"I’m always hungry, I love my corner shop – and I really don’t need to buy sumac. Now bring on the Angel Delight…Having long thought of myself as someone who cooks a lot, it turns out this was self-delusion of the worst order. I’m exhausted by all the cooking: not only the labour involved, since shopping now involves so much walking and queuing, but also by the constant whirring in my brain as I work out what might be made from whatever is in the house, and how best any leftovers might be eked out. Waking at three in the morning, I scroll through a list of those I love and miss, after which I quickly set to wondering whether yellow sprouting broccoli (as opposed to purple) is good for anything at all (answer: it isn’t).Relatedly: restaurants. Oh, my heart. What I wouldn’t give for a margherita with extra anchovies at Pizza Express escargots at Brasserie Zedel in London’s Piccadilly battered cod at the Magpie Cafe in Whitby a curry more authentic than one of my own a steaming bowl of pho a pretty plate of sushi.I’m prey, in my gilded cage, to all sorts of cravings. Foods bought and eaten in this period after a long absence: peanut butter, grapefruit, Frosties, Ferrero Rocher, beef shin. Next up: Angel Delight.On the subject of shin. With time on my hands, I decided to make a ragu like the one famously served at Trullo, in north London, the recipe for which is controversially not in its cookbook – and so, I joined the line at James Elliott, our blessed butcher, where I got the last piece of shin. Happiness! But then he said: “Have a nice weekend, madam” and I was lost I only just made it out of the door before the weeping began. Whoever could have guessed that stewing steak with a side of kindness would ever make me feel so emotional? (The ragu, by the way, was worth the half bottle of wine I chucked in it, and the five hours it took to cook. Not to boast, but it was the most delicious thing I’ve ever made.)I delivered two portions of this stew in a care package, complete with menu card and After Eights, to a friend who must isolate for 12 weeks. When he later sent me a photograph of his dinner tray all set up and ready to go, I realised all over again how much people love to be cooked for, and how happy it makes me to do so .Years ago, we began referring to our local Turkish store as The Shop That Has Everything. But now I realise that it really does have everything. It’s wonderful, and not a little chastening, the way that we’ve been brought to a new appreciation of those who serve us – the smiles exchanged over bunches of coriander and bottles of bleach! – whether at Sainsbury’s or in our corner shops.Goodbye sumac! None of us are in the market right now for recipes that require kaffir lime leaves or a pinch of lovage. Basically, we want to know if there’s any easily achievable dish involving tinned tomatoes that we’ve yet to make.How’s your appetite? I’m ravenous, but I know this isn’t real hunger. It’s born of boredom, anxiety and the simple fact that there’s more food in the house than usual. What’s especially alarming is that it takes me less than 20 seconds to walk from my home pilates studio – amazing what you can fit behind a sofa – to the fridge.I perhaps like a glass of wine with my dinner a little too much at this point, something that substituting the word “refreshed” for the word “pissed” does not, I fear, effectively hide.Life is meals, as James Salter once said. I now know, as I perhaps never fully did before, the truth of this. Here is comfort and togetherness, structure and ritual. Here, even in the sad moments, is happiness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b482bb3f3085a9cb454290cbd23e25a43b4b463/0_1864_6200_3717/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c14d881c2365a4e00c20b5833d07d7b4","title":"anoushka shankar dad ravi dal never cook","story":"The musician and daughter of Ravi Shankar talks about Bengali food, having George Harrison as an uncle and being Asian in CaliforniaI was born in 1981 and raised as an only child, so a lot of this will be about my mum. I’m remembering the lovely food she made. And I’m picturing this kitchen with a really odd, red linoleum floor, check red. I stood next to her a lot at the sink, while she was washing and I was drying – it’s a good time and place to chat. I never really cooked alongside her, but I don’t know why.Mum’s home food was comfy, exquisite and she was also capable of the most wonderful gourmet food. She’d mix the rice and dal with stuff and roll these easy-to-pick-up extra-softened little balls of rice. I have a very vivid memory of them. I think she’s the best cook in the world. Lots of people say that about their own mothers, but many people say it about my mother. Some of my mother’s Indian friends’ daughters would be learning to cook with their mother and they’d tease me about learning sitar with my dad, Ravi Shankar, instead. It was nothing nasty but I developed a complex about it.I ate Bengali food after my parents married and Dad started living with us, in both Willesden and in Delhi for three years, and then we all moved to California. Dad said he could make a really good dal, but I never saw him cook during the whole time we lived together.My memories of mealtimes are a real bleed of music and food. Music never really stopped in the music room, because everyone would move out to the table with their sitars. My dad would have an idea and we’d all be keeping time at the table, singing along, keeping patterns. And so many artists coming through, with amazing discussions around me.George Harrison became my uncle – not by blood but through love. It’s sort of an Indian cultural thing. He was deeply into the ayurvedic system and often talked to me about that. George and I were close and he was very jovial. I mean, both he and my dad were real jokesters, so there was a lot of laughter at the table.Moving to California made things better, somehow. In London, there’d been a real self-consciousness about being Asian. I felt that in California it didn’t mean anything to anyone – no one knew anything about India! – and that I could just make my own identity.Food is quite tricky for younger people who move and travel. I see it in my own kids now. Milk’s different in different countries bread’s totally different. So, I remember getting quite teary whenever we moved. But usually only for a couple of days.One thing I’m really finicky about is having proper kettles around. So I always carry one in my suitcase. I feel protected when I’m holding a really hot mug of tea.FOODA good salad full of protein, vegetables, leaves.RESTAURANTI love scrambled eggs at the Wolseley as a special, decadent brunch. The texture is just perfect – really creamy and sort of done but not done. I can’t get them right at home.

When all hell broke loose in the away end at Stamford Bridge at around 4.48pm on Saturday 24 January 2015, nobody associated with Bradford City wanted to stop and draw breath. Mark Yeates had just completed perhaps the greatest FA Cup upset in modern-day history and talk was already turning to the almighty party that would be happening in West Yorkshire when the 6,000-strong away support returned up the M1.The list of pubs and clubs we were planning to descend upon that evening was endless. Bradford would have never seen a party like it. But as we sat down for our first pint at around 10pm, the adrenaline had escaped us. The journey had taken its toll, and all we could do was think of bed. Physically and emotionally exhausted, but still in a sense of complete disbelief at what had happened that afternoon.My dad was never one for optimism. He warned upon taking me to my first game on Boxing Day 1995 – a bleak 1-1 draw with Sheffield United – that supporting Bradford would be a miserable experience. After half an hour at Stamford Bridge I couldn’t help but think he was right. Gary Cahill and Ramires had put Chelsea 2-0 ahead and our big day out in the capital was turning into a nightmare. Suddenly, though, right on half-time, a goal from Jon Stead gave us something.Not something to build on – I mean, nobody predicted what would happen next – just something to take home with us. A moment to remember. I battled in the concourse to try to get a phone signal to call home. “Not going well, is it … 2-1 down,” my dad said. “Are you kidding? We’ve scored at Stamford Bridge,” I replied. “Who cares what happens now?” I’m happy to admit that I was wrong. I did care.It’s easy to turn up your nose when people say the greatest moments in their lives are a blur. Looking back I understand why all that emotion and adrenaline may leave some hazy, but I remember every moment of the second half like it was yesterday. That feeling of optimism when we pushed the Premier League’s best side on to the back foot from the off was incredible.Somehow we equalised 15 minutes from time when Filipe Morais prodded home from close-range. I remember hugging people I’d never even met before, and over the next quarter of an hour we embraced again. “Imagine getting this lot back to Valley Parade,” I heard someone cry amid the mayhem of Morais’s equaliser.José Mourinho had clearly contemplated that prospect and, just before Morais made it 2-2, he sent on Cesc Fàbregas, Willian and Eden Hazard to kill the tie and silence the deafening noise in the away end. It didn’t work. With eight minutes left, Andy Halliday put Bradford ahead with a curling effort that Petr Cech in his prime, let alone the version who was between the sticks that day, would not have saved.It was 3-2. Grown men – myself included – were now in tears. Little old Bradford were about to do the unthinkable. And it became a reality in injury time when Yeates made it 4-2. Pandemonium doesn’t come close to describing the chaos among the supporters who had travelled south that Saturday morning in hope rather than expectation.Post-match I remember our tube carriage being full of supporters with claret and amber scarves trying to work out if they were dreaming. One or two Chelsea fans actually wished us luck for the next round – they probably couldn’t believe it either.The party back home never actually happened for us, but the memories made it worth the early night. And getting home early meant being able to watch Match of the Day. We were first on. I can’t imagine that will happen again for a while."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff2ab15a77c8558e8f85d97cee3fbda52219076/0_244_4756_2853/master/4756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9b9496916ccdb46d604d20b45ec0459","title":"premier league wants a way out but lack of answers is no surprise","story":"Failure of Friday’s meeting to navigate a way to conclude the football season is a reminder there are a lot of U-turns aheadMany years from now, when films are being made about the present strangeness, it will not go unnoticed that professional football’s collective indecisiveness managed to make the government’s daily press briefings look structured and resolute.Football is not important at the moment one can only agree with Sir Dave Brailsford’s conclusion that sport in general has been taught its place in the overall scheme of things by the events of the last few months. Though what seems likely to be remembered is that when the gravy train hit the buffers the national sport could not agree on anything.Not the right way to go about trimming the enormous wages of players now being mothballed, not a unified approach to the outgoings on non-playing staff in the absence of matches and gate income, not a sensible way to bring a disrupted season to an end and certainly not a timescale for when the dread prospect of fulfilling what remains of the fixture list behind closed doors may actually take place.A Premier League conference that aimed to nail down the last detail ended on Friday without a satisfactory conclusion being reached. The intention is still to see the season completed but drawing up a detailed schedule was just too difficult when “all dates are tentative”. No one was particularly surprised. Everyone’s dates are tentative at the moment not just football’s and one imagines the Premier League representatives knew the futility of their task before they even opened discussions.The very idea of trying to work out a timetable a day after the government had prolonged its indefinitely extendable lockdown policy by another three weeks was optimistic at best but the current stasis is being challenged by other sports in other countries. In addition, because of the size and complexity of the financial obligations the Premier League must find a way to discharge, it was probably felt a wait-and-see policy was not an option, particularly as the likelihood of clubs losing out-of-contract players if the season goes past 30 June is a real and pressing concern.When, inevitably, the only course that could be agreed on was to wait and see it became clearer than ever that football does not have all the answers, or indeed any of the answers. Perhaps we should already have known that given the number of U-turns over the problem of staff furloughing in the past few weeks.Mistakes have been made, there will be more of them, and due to the interconnectivity of football it is hard to imagine there will not be further U-turns or frantic backtracking before everything returns to normal.Domestic leagues want their own programmes completed first, which is understandable because they each comprise 20 or so clubs whose priority is to return to playing each other. Uefa, on the other hand, has a great deal invested in the Champions League, which Europe’s governing body is now saying can be played to a conclusion in late August, traditionally the time of year when the football season gets under way.Somewhere between these conflicting desires that other football tradition, a close season, is being squeezed out of existence. Some smaller countries, such as Belgium, have already indicated a willingness to simply write off this season as spoiled and start one as normal in late summer, though that option is not really open to bigger leagues where the financial implications of promotion and relegation run into many millions of pounds.Yet Belgium’s nuclear option is not without adherents in this country. An informal BBC survey of football fans has revealed that a majority of those who responded favoured the scrapping of the present season over the unappetising alternatives of playing behind closed doors or extending the league through summer.Such a course has simplicity in its favour, if not fairness, though it is doubtful whether many Liverpool fans would support it. There is no doubt Jürgen Klopp’s side are acknowledged champions. Everyone from Pep Guardiola downwards was saying that months ago, though there now seems no way their success can be recognised without compromise. Liverpool do not want to win their first title in 30 years in an empty stadium and neither do they wish to see the trophy awarded to Anfield along with an asterisk after an uncompleted season.The Spanish Football Federation has just unilaterally announced that the present top four will take the Champions League qualifying positions in the event of La Liga’s season being cut short or abandoned. That may appear a reasonable default position in the event of a worst-case scenario, though it happens that everyone in Spain’s top ision has played the same number of games.The same is not true of the Premier League, where Aston Villa, for instance, have a game in hand on most because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup final. Any notion Aston Villa may be relegated without playing that game in hand is a nonstarter, because as it stands at the moment three points would take them out of the bottom three, with Watford the most interested party in any such development.It hardly counts as a shock that football can be complicated, its intricate possibilities and permutations are normally what keep fans going between matches. What has never been fully appreciated before is the level of complication the absence of matches would bring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0458fd5b2a24edeacc9c3760b81a67de597a8bd/155_455_4211_2527/master/4211.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=038d9942c7e91cbb93aca8b929d5c6e3","title":"chile v italy 1962 world cup live","story":"Meanwhile down on the touchline ... BBC presenter and commentator David Coleman is recording his introduction to the highlights package that will be transmitted on BBC Television in three days time, this coming Tuesday at 10.25pm, by which time the film will have been flown back to London. Still a couple of months until Telstar goes up, innit. Anyway, Coleman doesn’t look very happy! “Good evening. The game you are about to see is the most stupid, appalling, disgusting and disgraceful exhibition of football in the history of the game. This is the first time these countries have met we hope it will be the last. The national motto of Chile reads, By Reason or By Force. Today, the Chileans weren’t prepared to be reasonable, the Italians only used force, and the result was a disaster for the World Cup. If the World Cup is going to survive in its present form something has got to be done about teams that play like this. Indeed, after seeing the film tonight, you at home may well think that teams that play in this manner ought to be expelled immediately from the competition.” Coleman stopped just short of a strangulated cry of “Won’t somebody think of the children?!?”, but we’re a little bit less sanctimonious. Remember to tune in on Tuesday, folks, sit back and enjoy! We guarantee you’ll like it!So the hosts are guaranteed a place in the quarter finals. Italy, on the other hand, are going home. Perhaps, given all that’s gone down on and off the field, that’s just as well. And anyway, there’s always next time. 1966 can’t pan out any worse for them, can it?The last act of the match sees Salvadore, thoroughly razzed off, jump in on Landa with little interest in connecting with the ball. Aston once again positions himself to stop World War Three breaking out, and then, utterly bored, takes the opportunity to blow for full time. As Mora rushes up to get in the ref’s grille, ostentatiously applauding in the sarcastic style, there’s one last majestic piece of childish nonsense. Maschio offers his hand to Landa as the two are shaking hands, Maschio crumps his other fist onto Landa’s jaw. Snide as hell, but set your morals aside and there’s something quite special about that, so cold and calculating and cynical. Contreras rushes in to assist his friend, who aims a kick at Maschio, but the Argentina-born Italian takes up a boxing stance, sticks up his dukes in the old-fashioned I’m-prepared-to-go-ten-rounds fashion, and he’s left well alone. Aston trudges off the field in a straight line, the shortest route, head slightly bowed. He’s away, washing his hands of the bedlam continuing behind him, and leaving everyone else to sweep up a mess which, let’s face it, was partly of his own making. 90 min: Mora goes in late on Eyzaguirre, meeting his dangling leg, the full back having long dispatched the ball. He follows up by throwing hands. Eyzaguirre doesn’t seem that interested in engaging, his unwillingness to get involved in unarmed combat no doubt influenced by the scoreline. Altafini races in to separate the two, and ends up laying hands on referee Aston, which doesn’t go down too well. The official, clearly long tired of the whole affair, tetchily throws the ball to the floor so the free kick can be taken. The message seeming to be: the sooner that’s done, the sooner we can all go home.Nope. This is all over, and Italy are going home, in retrospect the inevitable outcome since events of 80 minutes past. The prize wrestler Toro ends the bout with one almighty blow, lashing a shot into the bottom right from 25 yards. A gorgeous goal, totally out of keeping with the general aesthetic.87 min: Salvadore goes on a desperate scamper after a Mora wedge down the inside right, but ends up in a sea of photographers behind the goal. Time’s running out for the Italians. Can the nine men somehow find the equaliser that would mean survival? 86 min: Mora has a wild, opportunistic strike from out on the left. It’s quite hopeless. Chile go up the other end, where Leonel Sanchez replicates Mora’s under-achievement of seconds earlier.85 min: Fouilloux is in acres down the left. He curls a ball into the middle for Landa, who is clear in the box. Landa lets the ball clank around between his feet and can only dig out a poor shot that flies straight towards Mattrel. Somehow, Italy are still in this match, and retain a chance of staying in this World Cup. One goal is all they need.83 min: Nando Martellini seems to think the jig is up. “A long-distance free kick is all we’ve got left,” sighs our man from Canale 5. 82 min: Salvadore is bundled off the ball in the middle of the Chilean half. Mora decides what the hell, and goes for goal straight from the free kick. He’s nearly 40 yards out! The ball bounces out of play harmlessly wide right of goal, an overly optimistic effort rewarded with ironic cheers from the home support. What a waste, with time very much of the essence.80 min: Toro goes on the most basic but brilliant of runs, straight down the middle of the pitch. Sheer determination and presence allows him to retain possession, and he whistles a low shot inches wide right of goal. That snippet of football was superlative sport, nearly as good as the all-in wrestling. 79 min and a bit: FOOTBALL AS SCRIPTED BY DH LAWRENCE! Mora is wandering with the ball near the centre circle. Toro gives chase, and rugby tackles the Italian to the ground. Then refuses to let go! Aston is forced to bend down and prise them apart, as though the pair were wrestling naked on a rug in front of an intense fire. This is beyond pathetic. Toro finally gets up and presents the very picture of innocence, while Mora has to be stopped from attempting to spark a Hegelian dialectic using only his hands. He’s livid, real after-last-orders let-me-at-him stuff. There’s a lot of pushing and shoving, before Aston finally tries to calm Mora down. He doesn’t meet his targets: Mora stomps off waving his hands around in the Mediterranean fashion. Toro should probably have seen red as the aggressor, and there’s a case for Mora receiving his marching orders too.79 min: A bit of space for Fouilloux, who batters a rising shot from a tight angle on the right straight at Mattrel. 78 min: Well, this game has opened up, all of a sudden! Altafini feeds Maschio down the right. Maschio swings a long ball into the area, which Altafini meets, eight yards out. But his header is weak and straight at Escuti. On another day, Altafini could have had two goals. Perhaps another day for the Milan striker, another big match. 77 min: Italy are rocking here. Landa nearly breaks clear down the left but is forced to check back. Toro picks up possession, drops a shoulder to get into the box, and fires a shot towards the bottom-left corner. Mattrell parries brilliantly.76 min: ANOTHER GOAL FOR CHILE!!! BUT IT’S DISALLOWED. What a lovely sweeping move this was. Ramirez, to the right of the centre circle, rolls the ball inside to Rojas, who romps upfield and sets Landa into the area, free down the inside right. He sort of half-rounds Mattrel on the outside before slotting home, helped by the keeper’s hands flapping back like the doors of a saloon. The pitch again fills with over-excitable snappers, but they quickly u-turn when it’s clear Landa was some way offside.75 min: Mora and Altafini cause the restart to be delayed, as they’re complaining to Aston about goodness knows what. So much for holding on for that point! Toro bustles down the left, and is clattered by Robotti. Maschio arrives on the scene to throw a little snide kick into the mix. The karmic payback is instant. Navarro swings a free kick into the Italian area. Mattrel comes off his line to punch clear, but it’s a weak effort, the ball dropping towards Ramirez, eight yards out, level with the right-hand post. He sends a looping header towards the top right, and despite two blue shirts defending the line, it creeps in. The instant snap and crackle of celebration pops many an eardrum. The pitch is flooded by photographers again, who finally have a few smiling faces to snap instead of the usual sour phizogs.73 min: Ramirez curls a cross to the far post from the right. Janich clears, but only to Rojas, who snatches at his shot from the edge of the area, the ball flying well wide left. 71 min: Italy win a corner down the right, but nothing comes from it. They’ve rarely threatened since Altafini missed that header in the first half. It looks like they’ve settled for the point which would at least keep them in this competition, understandable in the circumstances.69 min: Rojas goes on a slalom down the inside-left channel, but he’s crowded out, blue shirts swarming around him. Italy have been very disciplined at the back, like that’s ever news, nine men or no.67 min: Mora exchanges passes with Altafini down the left, and cuts inside as he approaches the box. Contreras bundles him over, then stamps on the prone Italian captain’s leg for good measure. This didn’t start well, and it isn’t going to end well.66 min: ITALY HAVE THE BALL IN THE NET!!! But it won’t count. Altafini ghosts past Navarro, tight on the right touchline, then drifts inside, past two other Chileans, and sticks the ball away from a tight angle. But the whistle’s long gone, the ball having marginally drifted out of play. That was an extremely close call, and it’d be lovely to see another angle of that. Still, Italy can’t feel too hard done by, as the covering players, Raul Sanchez and Landa, had stopped competing, and Escuti didn’t even pay lip service to making a save. Mora isn’t happy with the decision, though, and engages the referee in appropriate discourse.64 min: Yes, so much for Mora of the United Nations. He takes a full-blown rake down Contreras’s calves as the two tangle out on the right wing. He’d already won the free kick, for goodness sake. Aston, showcasing what appears to be his signature move, does absolutely nothing. Having said that, the ref then makes a small show of ordering Maschio to hurry up with the set piece, a strange diktat seeing the player’s nowhere near the ball and clearly never going to be taking the free kick anyway. It’s fair to say Mr Aston’s head is scrambled too, albeit in a different way to the constantly sparring players.63 min: It’s been fairly quiet in terms of nonsense since the restart, but things may just be heating up again. First Mora – the peacemaker in the first half, remember – hacks at Navarro and Raul Sanchez in quick succession as he goes on a wild sortie down the right. Then Eyzaguirre pointlessly and provocatively runs into Maschio on the other wing, before trotting away waving his arms dismissively. 62 min: A couple of long shots from Chile: the first from Rojas earns two rugby points, the second is an over-ambitious effort by Contreras on the left touchline. It stays left. Italy are holding out easily enough right now. Less than half-an-hour to see out, and they’ll maintain an interest in this year’s tournament.60 min: The ever-busy Toro is brought down 30 yards from goal by Janich. Leonel Sanchez sends the free kick rising towards the top left, an unerring heat-seeker. But Mattrel is its equal, and tips the ball round for a corner at full stretch. Italy deal with the resulting corner without fuss.58 min: A rare moment of attacking creativity from Italy, as Mora tries to make ground along the right by flicking the ball over his own head and spinning away. It’s a cute trick but Navarro is waiting for him a couple of steps up the field, and puts a stop to his gallop.56 min: Toro is bundled over as he makes his way down the right. The free kick is blasted into the wall, and the rebound is dragged well wide left by the incessant Toro. Before Mattrel can restart the game, Salvadore decides to sit on the turf and roll around for a while, eating up another minute or so. This is a masterclass in sharp practice.55 min: Toro, drifting right to left, evades two reckless sliding challenges before firing a shot just over the bar from 20 yards. Chile are getting closer, step by careful step. Mattrel takes an age to gather the ball from behind the goal. The crowd do their pantomime duty. In the next phase of play, Landa, perhaps getting a tad frustrated that the game remains goalless, chases a ball he’s never going to get down the inside right and leaves a foot in on Salvadore, who was shielding his keeper as he came out to collect. There’s a bit of passionate debate about this, a lively back-and-forth.54 min: Maschio plays a little basketball as he prepares to take a throw. He’d have stopped and whistled four verses of Sweet Georgia Brown if the referee had let him, but Aston runs over and for the benefit of those in the stands, taps his watch theatrically.53 min: Italy are already trying it on with a view to running down the clock. Mattrel and Salvadore faff around at the back, tapping it to each other until Landa jogs up and forces the keeper to pick the ball up and get a wriggle on. 51 min: Ramirez, from the edge of the box, fires a header straight at Mattrel. Chile, two men to the good, are bossing the possession, but still haven’t put Italy’s keeper under serious pressure.49 min: Landa and Toro so nearly one-two their way through the thick blue line on the edge of the Italian area, but their intricate work doesn’t quite come off. Toro is scythed to the floor by Maschio, just to the right of the D. Leonel Sanchez takes a long run up, but pea-rolls the free kick straight to whoever wants it in the wall. That was dismal. The ball’s reclaimed and Navarro has a dig from distance. It’s on target for the bottom right but easily smothered by Mattrel.47 min: No, they’ve decided the best form of defence is attack. Mora entertains himself with a sly kick in the back of Navarro. That might have been a good old-fashioned boot up the arse, actually, but it’s hard to tell in the bright sun whether toecap connected with Special Place.

Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short?

Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra.

An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times.

The argument that was put, that we don’t want to confuse the message, I think is just wrong. It underestimates the public. The public understand that there are phases to this.”Davis also called for the data underpinning the government’s strategy to be made public.Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said on Saturday that the government should respect that the British people were “capable of recognising what they need to do in lockdown”.He said the government needed to “bring the British people into its confidence”, and that the public had “already shown a remarkable level of common sense”.He also accused the government of treating people “like children” by refusing to discuss exit strategies.“The government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children,” he told the Times. “We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point, in an economic sense.”Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said that the best way to ensure public cooperation with the government was to keep people informed. He said a “general road map” spelling out the lockdown measures, but without a timetable of how they would progress, would be “well received” by the nation.“What we need is strategic clarity as to what happens next, and that’s what I’m calling for,” he said.“My concern has been that there has been a clarion call for an exit strategy when the government must make clear there is no exit from this until a vaccine is procured and delivered to a sizeable proportion of the population, therefore the longevity of this needs to be managed.”“Letting the nation know what is coming round the corner helps keep minds focused and people on board,” he added.Ellwood admitted that the prime minister’s absence had been a “real setback” in communication with the public, describing Boris Johnson as “the best communicator in government”.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also blamed the government’s lack of information on the end of lockdown on  Johnson’s absence, a claim which the spokesperson for the prime minister said was “just wrong”.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The government has already set out five clear tests to consider before making any adjustment to its approach.“At all times we have been consistently guided by scientific advice to protect lives. The current advice from Sage is that relaxing any of the measures could risk damage to public health, our economy, and the sacrifices we have all made.“Only when the evidence suggests that it is safe to do, and the scientific advice provides for it, will we adjust these measures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933f9e370a87924c8ab4f5085291a1c54265469d/0_79_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d58967c95ee0b721ad6d6583eda679","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.“Please keep your distance,” one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia’s space agency.Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus. “It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.On Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.Even minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.Due to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06462836b9948633a581926ed7a7566181ca7d9e/0_161_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d4538235dd894a3e4b423c084ffcea","title":"mediterranean shipwrecks reveal birth of globalisation in trade","story":"Preserved cargoes of vessels linking eastern cultures with western Europe show ‘the barbarian Orient’ was a trendsetter For almost seven decades archaeologists have searched the eastern Mediterranean in vain for wrecks that sank along antiquity’s mighty shipping lanes.Now, though, a British-led team can reveal a spectacular discovery – a fleet of Hellenistic, Roman, early Islamic and Ottoman wrecks that were lost some two kilometres below the waves of the Levantine Basin between the 3rd century BC and the 19th century.Sean Kingsley, director of the Centre for East-West Maritime Exploration and archaeologist for the Enigma Shipwrecks Project (ESP), told the Observer: “This is truly ground-breaking, one the most incredible discoveries under the Mediterranean.”The ESP’s ambitious underwater exploration used cutting-edge remote and robotic technology to research and record the finds, some of which could rewrite history, according to the experts involved.One of the wrecks is a 17th-century Ottoman merchant ship, described as “an absolute colossus”, which was so big two normal-sized ships could have fitted on its deck. Its vast cargo has hundreds of artefacts from 14 cultures and civilisations, including the earliest Chinese porcelain retrieved from a Mediterranean wreck, painted jugs from Italy and peppercorns from India. ESP say the ship reveals a previously unknown maritime silk and spice route running from China to Persia, the Red Sea and into the eastern Mediterranean.The ship, which is thought to have sunk around 1630, while sailing between Egypt and Istanbul, is a time-capsule that tells the story of the beginning of the globalised world, Kingsley said: “The goods and belongings of the 14 cultures and civilisations discovered, ning on one side of the globe China, India, the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, and to the west North Africa, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, are remarkably cosmopolitan for pre-modern shipping of any era.”He added: “At 43 metres long and with a 1,000-ton burden, it is one of the most spectacular examples of maritime technology and trade in any ocean. Its size is matched by the breadth of its cargoes.”The Chinese porcelain includes 360 decorated cups, dishes and a bottle made in the kilns of Jingdezhen during the reign of Chongzhen, the last Ming emperor that were designed for sipping tea, but the Ottomans adapted them for the craze then spreading across the East – coffee drinking. Hidden deep in the hold were the earliest Ottoman clay tobacco pipes found on land or sea. They were probably illicit because there were severe prohibitions then against tobacco smoking.Kingsley said: “Through tobacco smoking and coffee drinking in Ottoman cafes, the idea of recreation and polite society – hallmarks of modern culture – came to life. Europe may think it invented notions of civility, but the wrecked coffee cups and pots prove the ‘barbarian Orient’ was a trailblazer rather than a backwater. The first London coffeehouse only opened its doors in 1652, a century after the Levant.”Steven Vallery, co-director of Enigma, said: “In the Levantine Basin, the Enigma wrecks lie beyond any country’s territory. All the remains were carefully recorded using a suite of digital photography, HD video, photomosaics and multibeams. For science and underwater exploration, these finds are a giant leap forward.”The last phase of Enigma’s fieldwork was carried out at the end of 2015, with the post-excavation process continuing for years after and remaining unpublicised until now. Some of the recovered artefacts are being held in Cyprus, from where the archaeologists worked. Initial concerns that the site was in Cypriot waters have been disproved, Kingsley said, and the Enigma team now hopes the entire collection will go on permanent exhibition in a major public museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

We cannot afford to risk losing any more. Just yesterday the health and social care secretary said he could not guarantee that hospitals would not run out this weekend,” Nagpaul added.At least 56 NHS workers have died from coronavirus. The actual number of health workers to have lost their lives is likely to be higher, as not all deaths will be in the public domain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73c1272f6de2e5634dbd60b2af93987a2263e436/0_246_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4bb161fdceca342aa7bd3102823a7f2","title":"ask moeen the england all rounder answers guardian readers questions","story":"Moeen Ali shares his views on Test cricket, the club game and Vikram Solanki getting his foot lodged in a wallWhat do you think about the future of Test cricket? Do we need to shorten it or produce more sporting pitches? (Nasih Ul Wadud Alam ) I don’t think we need to shorten Test cricket and the wickets are actually pretty sporting these days. The key is to avoid extremes. The best pitches have a bit of seam and a bit of spin but are good to bat on too.Being so elegant and seemingly effortless at batting, do you find that people think you are not trying when you are in a bad run of form? (Jack Counsell) For sure. But that’s been the case since I was young. If I got out people would say it was a lazy shot or I wasn’t interested. I am interested, it’s just my style and it looks like that. I feel like anyone else on the inside, and commit to shots the same. But I think commentators understand it more these days. Someone like David Gower moving into the commentary box probably helped. He almost gave players like myself a voice among all the analysis.Are you more nervous coming out to bat or before you bowl your first ball? (Chloe Hole) Definitely before bowling my first ball. The responsibility I have with the ball, especially in Test matches, is a lot more than my batting. I’m still nervous before batting, don’t get me wrong, it’s just there’s more on me as a bowler, especially if I’m the only spinner in the team. The more you play the more you get used to the nerves and start to embrace them.What advice would you give boys and girls thinking about trying to make a career out of cricket? (Rob Hamill) The cliche about working hard is true. But beyond this, I would tell any young cricketer to make sure they really enjoy the company and camaraderie. Runs and wickets are one thing, but the friendships you make during your playing days, and the times you enjoy together, will stay with you for ever.Hardest away ground you’ve played at? (Charlie @crobertson95Toughest place to tour? Declan Heels) Australia is for me, personally, the hardest place to tour. The wickets are so good for batting, which made bowling hard, and mentally it was quite challenging. In terms of the ground, Newlands in Cape Town is pretty tough to bowl on as a spinner.When was the last time you played a game for your local club side and how did it go? And do you think you’ll be tempted to play club cricket again when you eventually retire? (Tony Medlock) It was probably in 2014, a week before my Test debut. I have no idea how I got on, though. This year I have signed up for West Bromwich Dartmouth CC, where my two brothers (Kadeer and Omar) and cousin (Kabir) play. Any spare weekend, I’ll join them – if we get a season. I’ll play professionally for as long as I can and I’ll definitely play club cricket after that, probably until I can’t physically do it any more. There’s no ego. I don’t mind if the eyes go and some rubbish bowlers get me out – I’ve got out loads of times!The one thing you would change about cricket? (Sam @sam_willet) I’d probably say slightly fewer international fixtures or cut down some of the bigger tours length-wise – it can get very hard if you play all formats. One thing I wish we could change overall would be the price of equipment. It’s a very expensive sport to take up for kids if they want good-quality kit. Especially in England.What is the biggest meltdown you’ve witnessed when a dismissed batsman has returned to the dressing room? (Dan Davis) At Worcestershire it was Vikram Solanki putting his foot through a wall and getting it stuck in there. For England it was Alex Hales smashing his helmet up into the smallest pieces I’ve ever seen using his bat. Both were pretty funny.Which English Test ground is your favourite to bowl on and why? (Nathan Boroda) There’s two. Old Trafford for the bounce, which all spinners enjoy, and then also Lord’s for the slope. Even if there’s not much turn from the pitch, it gives you some natural variation to work with from either end.What style of batting best suits your game in the long format? You have been moved around the order with mixed success, but seem at your best when taking on the bowling. (Tom Barrington) It’s changed over time. When I first came in I was a bit more reserved, like during my first Test hundred at Headingley. That was the best of my five. But lower down the order I’ve always felt putting pressure back on the bowlers is the way to go. It has made trying to switch back and grind it out harder.How do you think I can get my young nephew and niece interested in the game? (Michael Brenna) Play the game with them and keep the drills very simple so that when they make those little improvements through repetition, it sparks their interest more and more.Do you ever see yourself captaining England and is it something you aspire to do? (James Hancock and Dave Churchley) There would probably need to be four players injured. I enjoy captaining Worcestershire and we’ve had success but with England it’s not something I’ve thought about too much. You have ambitions like anyone but, realistically, it’s not really crossed my mind.Favourite curry house in Birmingham? (Jack Downes) I don’t tend to go to them because the food at home is usually better. I like Lebanese or Moroccan restaurants when I’m out. My current favourite is Al-Bader, a Lebanese on Ladypool Road in Birmingham.Thoughts on Headingley 2014? You scored an unbeaten hundred and almost denied Sri Lanka a win only for Jimmy Anderson, last man in, to get out off the penultimate delivery. (Rex Clementine @RexClementine) The memories are a little bit bitter because we lost. But the innings did so much for my self-belief and knowing I could play at international level. It’s a shame too because if we’d saved the match that innings might have been spoken about more. We lost and it almost became a bit, yeah, whatever.Who is the greatest all-rounder, Kallis or Stokes? (Al Prince) It’s a tough one. You’d probably have to go Kallis as it stands because his body of work is so much bigger: more runs, wickets, catches etc. But if Stokesy carries on like he is he will become one of the greatest players to ever play the game. No doubt.Does racism still exist in top-flight cricket? (Stuart Drysdalen) I don’t really experience it these days. Maybe you hear the odd comment or a stereotype that sounds like it could be a bit ‘that way’. But I don’t think it’s really in the sport.Do you realise how much the majority of England fans love you and do you use a sports psychologist? (Simon Brett) The sports psychologists use me, rather than the other way around. In all seriousness, I do a bit but I also think there are limits and sometimes only a player or coach who has experienced the same problem as you’re facing can help.Yes and no on the fans question. You know there are a lot of fans and it’s nice to hear when they say they enjoy watching you play. True fans get it. But it doesn’t matter who you are, even Sachin Tendulkar or Virat Kohli, there will always be people against you for whatever reason. It’s not always cricket-related either.This current break has made me realise that when you find yourself surrounded by a few negative comments, somehow it’s all you can focus on. You have to be mentally stronger and filter more of it out.With so much happening in the world right now, this has been time to reflect. You realise you don’t know how long you are on earth and so what people might say about you really doesn’t matter. If that’s someone in the media talking about your cricket, they’re just doing their job and there is no point getting affected.It’s almost been a case of forgiving anyone who has ever said anything I didn’t like and now looking to start afresh when we get back playing. I may have felt like a scapegoat at times in the past but I’m over it now. It’s time to move on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70cee8883d2b3764620cf1602e02f13c8c907ff4/375_0_5625_3376/master/5625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=567c4ea02af4685e1ec0828f30853fba","title":"hope high radio 5 live review huddersfield gangs the essay rachel cooke single women radio 3","story":"A brilliant BBC investigation into teens, knives and county lines makes for a gripping listenHere are a couple of interesting non-virus series to remind us of our old interconnected world, where people lived all tangled up with one another and what happened when they did.Hope High is an excellent documentary podcast about teenagers in Huddersfield who have been groomed into working for gangs. Reporter, producer and presenter Annabel Deas usually works as a news producer for 5 Live but, “frustrated by the endless news reports about a child carrying a knife ‘being in a gang’ – as if that was an explanation” – she spent a year in West Yorkshire, talking to children who carry knives and those who care for them.In the first episode she goes into the school that some of the teenagers attend: North Huddersfield Trust. It’s clearly a brilliant school that goes the extra mile: the head spends hours on the phone to social services, trying to get help for her pupils. Soon we meet the grandmother of one of the boys, Aaron, who is in such peril that he had to be taken to Jamaica for a while to get out of danger. Now he’s back, he can’t stay at his mum’s, for fear of gang repercussions. He goes into care. Social services say that he and his family could move to Manchester, for their own safety, but don’t help them to do so.We meet other children: Josh, Daniel, Steven. All around them there is violence. Knifings on their street. Gunshots, but the shooting isn’t reported. Dangerous people move into their homes. We don’t often hear the children talk, which could make Hope High a little frustrating, but Deas’s hard work and skilled storytelling brings their tales to life. She is direct, visceral – I loved her vivid description of one of the boys eating a McDonald’s – and she makes you understand. The authorities, according to all the parents, don’t get involved enough. The police don’t prosecute children for having a knife, or carrying a small amount of cocaine, or trying to beat up their mum, because they don’t want to criminalise young people. The result? Teenagers think they can get away with it. And social services seem… well, let’s call it distracted, to be charitable.One 14-year-old got involved in county lines dealing. He went missing for three weeks. “Social services were onboard,” says his mum. “I were updating them with any information they needed... they were saying they had a plan, for when he’s caught. But when he came back, they did nothing. Diddly squat.” There was a pattern to her son’s behaviour: she informed the police, reported him as a missing person. She wanted him to be arrested, moved, taken away from her, anything to change his behaviour. But the authorities sat on their hands. Eventually, her son was arrested for a violent assault and sentenced to five years. When he comes out, his childhood will be over.Somewhat frustratingly, Hope High appears to have dropped off BBC Sounds’ podcast recommendations. Perhaps this sort of story seems irrelevant when nobody is going out. But police have said that even now, many young people are still being made to cross county lines to deliver drugs. This grooming is not stopping.Just room to mention Radio 3’s The Essay. Last week it was on the brilliantly interesting topic of single women – written and presented by my fellow Observer writer Rachel Cooke. Cooke is wonderfully well read, but wears her knowledge lightly and with style. In her first essay, she explains that the word “spinster” comes from “spinner”: an unwed woman, orphan or widow who worked with cotton and wool in the family home. Cooke makes the case for replacing “spinster” with “the odd woman”, which I love. She also covers career girls, the orcee, widows and aunts – all fabulous categories of woman, and Cooke clearly enjoys celebrating each one. They are single, but involved in the world. Alone, but far from lonely. Sounds delightful.Locked TogetherAudible UK Audible makes great audio (podcasts and audio books), which you usually have to pay for. But earlier this month it launched Audible Stories, making hundreds of audiobooks available for free, to help keep kids and young adults entertained during these quiet times. And now it’s given us these: a set of eight warm and funny podcasts made in lockdown by comedy duos (and one collective, the hilarious Kurupt FM boys). French and Saunders chat about hair Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse morph into different characters Simon Pegg and Nick Frost talk films. Cheering.Absolute Radio’s mental health driveAbsolute Radio, and all its various “decade” stations (Absolute Radio 60s, 90s etc), gives a lot of bang for its buck. On the evening of bank holiday Monday, on the main Absolute station, it staged a resourceful and lovely Front Room festival, with various bands playing tracks live from their homes (here’s Kodaline). Plus, every station is promoting mental health awareness throughout this tricky time, while there’s a series of shows, Time to Listen, which explores music’s positive impact by getting musicians to talk about tracks that have helped them. Excellent stuff."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bf5433039a4519bbda01b3f38cd5ac89a9110e0/0_177_3824_2293/master/3824.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b8bc5981680292dc0711c17c99c0c02","title":"the 10 best food tv shows to watch on lockdown","story":"From the inimitable Anthony Bourdain to classic Madhur Jaffrey, food programmes offer much more a recipe catch-up. But which ones should you stream now?Isolation draws us into a closer relationship with the telly but food TV offers more than just a chance to catch up on recipes and techniques. Over recent years, programmes have moved away from “stand and stir” and are now an excellent excuse for all manner of science, cultural history, humour, escapism and pure entertainment.I love a tight 27 minutes on thrifty ways with mince as much as the next food nerd but, with everyone else gone to bed and everything else going to hell, it’s always going to be me and Anthony Bourdain. I love the early stuff such as A Cook’s Tour (2002-3, Food NetworkAmazon Prime) which see him reeling around Ho Chi Minh City, dressed like Joe Strummer and jabbering into a lo-fi, hand-held video camera. But there is so much more to choose from. No Reservations (2005-12,Travel ChannelAmazon Prime) allowed Bourdain nine seasons to develop his compelling combination of chill and total engagement with his subject. By around season four, any idea of “celebrity chef” is subsumed in a search for challenging locations, fascinating and underrepresented people and increasingly honest examinations of his own flawed past. Parts Unknown (2013-18, CNNAmazon Prime) contains my two favourite episodes. New Jersey (season 5, episode 6) is an elegiac film that sees him visiting his childhood home with his brother, and in Rome (season 8, episode 9) he is guided around the city by Asia Argento, with whom he later formed a relationship.Did you enjoy This Is Spinal Tap or the The Life of Rock with Brian Pern? The comedy of spoof “rockumentary” lies in the uncalibrated self-regard of the subjects and the breathless complicity of the film-maker, so you’re going to love Chef’s Table. From the bombastic Vivaldi over the titles to the shots of Dan Barber, running while philosophising, or Francis Mallmann on his private island, hewing logs and talking about the creative power of sex, it’s difficult to imagine that the first series wasn’t all an expensively executed troll. But that was back in 2015, when we wanted our chefs to be artistgodsrockstars of their generation and American documentary-makers still had little enough irony to support the idea.As the series progressed they began to profile more female chefs and some of the resulting shows are outstanding. Jeong Kwan, cooking at the Chunjinam Hermitage in South Korea is therapeutic to watch, Cristina Martinez at the South Philly Barbacoa and Mashama Bailey at The Grey in Savannah, Georgia are inspiring, and our own Asma Khan is given space to properly expand on Indian food in the UK. Someone, somewhere turned down the ego dial.PBS, 2012-2017 – season 6 on FacebookTakes a similarly hagiographic approach as Chef’s Table but allows each featured chef more space to cook. Gabrielle Hamilton – troubled, driven, phenomenally talented – comes across particularly well. It’s probably to her credit that our own April Bloomfield actually looks uncomfortable throughout her episodes, awkwardly attempting Delia-esque presentation while the directors try to extract some sort of life philosophy or grandiose soundbite out of her. It’s actually charming and should make us proud.Carlos Perez Osorio’s show will make you believe that there might actually be a future for intelligent food programmes on TV. Each of the six half-hour episodes covers a different type of taco in obsessive depth. The show is in Spanish and subtitled, a serious deep e into the subject, but delivered with a brilliant tone – fantastically, poetically hyperbolic about street food, enthusiastic but self-aware.BBC iPlayer is a positive treasure vault of old favourites, offering a great deal of Keith Floyd’s unhinged, plonk-fuelled pan-rattling and Ken Hom’s masterful Chinese Cooking. They are welcome old friends but favourite must be Jaffrey’s six-part series on regional Indian cooking. Her on-camera persona is calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense, presenting challengingly authentic recipes in the most authoritative manner. If you think this sounds a bit too worthily BBC2 … check out her debut as a rapper in a YouTube video by Brooklyn MC, Mr Cardamom.Netflix, 2019 to presentJon Favreau is a producer and actor who starred in the movie Chef, with his chef mate Roy Choi, and quite fancies himself as a chef. In The Chef Show (see what he did there?), they hang out in the borrowed kitchens of their Hollywood buddies. It has about as much script or editorial control as a podcast, but with full quality video. What is most noticeable is that there’s no attempt to give recipes … in fact, all the ingredients seem to arrive pre-prepped and measured in tiny plastic pots. I want to hate the OG bro-fest format, but it’s actually compelling if you relax into it.The next time you’re down the YouTube rabbit hole, seek out Julia Child. Like an American Fanny Cradock but infinitely nicer, she taught a nation to love French cuisine. There are loads of clips and some full episodes of her PBS cooking shows, which are an innocent treat and from which you’ll still pick up helpful recipes and tips. Childs collaborated with French chef Jacques Pepin who also had his own programmes concentrating on technique. The clips available on YouTube are still some of the most instructive out there. By far the most important one covers boning a chicken for a ballotine which is cult viewing among chefs.A feature-length documentary about the man who managed to arrive in San Francisco just in time to be a driving force in California cuisine. His rise from untrained kitchen boy at Chez Panisse to the very peak of his industry, his acclaimed restaurant, Stars, and his catastrophic crash-and-burn makes for a brilliant, unflinching profile.Samin Nosrat is another graduate of Chez Panisse whose highly successful 2017 book Salt, Fat, Acid Heat was quickly turned into a four-part docuseries. The book’s simple idea of breaking cooking down into four conceptual basics enables her to travel the world in search of examples. Like our own Nadiya Hussain, she’s a natural presenter whose integrity and enthusiasm draws you in.Presented by culinary wunderkind David Chang of the celebrated Momofuku restaurant group. There are parts of the early shows that are big on chest-beating, high-fiving, alpha-malery, but in the most recent he turns to important cultural issues around global cooking. He also discovers he’s going to become a dad, sheds an actual tear, and then teaches us all how to make baby food. OK, it’s a kind of predictable conversion but, if you start watching them in reverse order, they’re very enjoyable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fca2674d6d927929b068326a4a6269151e8eed/0_326_5181_3110/master/5181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=334b3e65d22a95a2daa602abe468a740","title":"florida beaches hundreds coronavirus","story":"Some beaches open with distancing restrictions after governor OKs openings ‘in a safe way’Hundreds of people in Florida reportedly flocked to several beaches as they reopened for “essential activities” after being closed because of the coronavirus outbreak, despite the state’s death toll climbing to 726.When police removed barriers from one of these beeches on Friday, crowds cheered, CNN reported.The Republican Florida governor Ron DeSantis, who was widely criticized for moving slowly to contain the outbreak, permitted some re-openings.DeSantis said some cities should feel free to re-open beaches and parks if doing so could be done safely, and with social-distancing restrictions.“Do it in a good way,” DeSantis told reporters, saying people needed fresh air. “Do it in a safe way.”The areas that reopened were in north Florida, including stretches of sand in Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Atlantic Beach, local TV reported.The “essential activities” permitted at Jacksonville Beach include “recreational activities consistent with social distancing guidelines such as walking, biking, hiking, fishing, running, swimming, taking care of pets and surfing”.“This beach will be open from 6am to 11am, and from 5pm to 8pm each evening,” local station WJAX said.Sunbathing is not permitted. Other restrictions include prohibitions on towels and blankets, coolers and grills, and beach chairs, as well as “lingering on the beach without moving”, and gatherings exceeding 10 people.“Folks, this could be the beginning of the pathway back to normal life, but please respect and follow these limitations,” said the Jacksonville mayor, Lenny Curry. “We’ll get back to life as we know it but we must be patient.”“I honestly thought it was phenomenal,” the Jacksonville resident Amanda Campos told the local media outlet First Coast News. “It gives people fresh air. They can go for a walk. It’s nothing crazy. We’re not saying the clubs are opening and it’s not a closed space.”Deborah Melvin, a Jacksonville resident who said she had lost family and friends to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, said: “This is really a crazy bad idea.”“I’m afraid. I’m afraid for myself. I’m afraid for my family. Everybody should use their common sense,” she added.DeSantis issued a statewide stay-at-home order on 1 April, much later than many states and one month after Florida marked its first confirmed Covid-19 cases. He drew significant criticism for not closing beaches during the earlier college spring break, which easily draws hundreds of thousands to the state annually, when beaches were packed and some dismissed the dangers of the virus.The New York Times reported that people fell ill with coronavirus in Florida, and then returned home with the virus.Florida’s beach reopenings also come amid Trump’s calls to reopen the US economy and growing protests in some states, driven by rightwing figures, about social and business restrictions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084c85285b3407059f44a643e44a9204db0cc494/0_171_5244_3148/master/5244.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=438f7c4c79fa9879f42d854b152b96f1","title":"gulf coast deepwater horizon oil industry louisiana","story":"The Deepwater Horizon devastated the ecology and economy from Texas to Florida but BP-funded recovery programs are ongoing and the sector is a big employerWhen the explosion ripped through the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, Leo Linder was standing in his living quarters in his underwear. He suddenly found himself facing a fellow rig worker in what had been a separate room because the force of the explosion had blown the walls away.Linder wasn’t to know it at the time but the blast was to trigger the worst environment disaster in US history, with the BP operation spewing more than 4.9m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, fouling hundreds of miles of shoreline from Texas to Florida, decimating wildlife and crippling local fishing and tourism industries.The spill also had a human cost, with 11 workers dying in the disaster. One of them, Gordon Jones, had relieved Linder around an hour before the explosion. “He said, ‘What the hell are you doing, go home,’” Linder said. “In many ways he saved my life. The guilt from surviving, as well as the damage done, still gnaws at me. It kills me.”The recovery has been patchy, with some businesses unable to recover and some people forced to move away.“It was a bit like a bad dream,” said Albertine Kimble, a retiree who has spent the past two decades in Carlisle, a small town south of New Orleans. “It was impending doom, it affected the fisheries and the birds. It was even more depressing than Hurricane Katrina and that flooded my house.”Kimble has had to raise her house twice on stilts due to the threat of flooding in an area prone to storms and coastal erosion accelerated by the climate crisis. The process has also been worsened by the oil and gas industry’s practice of forging canals through wetlands, which has introduced corrosive salt water. The nearby town of Pointe à la Hache was turned into a “ghost town” as fishing opportunities vanished, Kimble said.“It was a bit like the coronavirus, just dead,” she said. “I don’t think it’s recovered, to tell you the truth.”The fishing industry is a major constituent of life in southern Louisiana and shutting down the ability to catch fish, oysters and shrimp was a major blow to communities. Many of the fishermen and women used their boats to help the clean-up effort by deploying booms and spreading oil dispersant.Even after the Gulf was declared safe to fish in again, crews initially reported pulling in smaller catches of oddly deformed fish with oozing sores. Dolphins started dying in record numbers, tuna and amberjack developed deformities to their heart and other organs. Scientists have also found lingering problems within the web of marine life.Recent research by the University of Florida found the richness of species in the Gulf has declined by more than a third due to direct and indirect impacts of the spill. A separate study of 2,500 inidual fish from 91 species by the University of South Florida found oil exposure in all of them.Many of the species are popular types of seafood. The extent of the exposure has startled researchers.“We were quite surprised that among the most contaminated species was the fast-swimming yellowfin tuna as they are not found at the bottom of the ocean where most oil pollution in the Gulf occurs,” said lead author Erin Pulster, a researcher at the university’s college of marine science.“It was an entire Gulf of Mexico-wide event,” said Tracey Sutton, a marine scientist at Nova Southeastern University. told Oceana. “Nobody was ready for this scale of pollution. As far as we know, the actual impact of the spill is not over yet.”Deepwater Horizon exploded 40 miles off the coast and shot out oil that proved devilishly difficult to clean from the nooks and crannies of Louisiana’s marshland. An initial attempt to cap the spill was unsuccessful, necessitating the drilling of a secondary relief well to stem the flow. It took four months to completely stop the gushing oil.In all, BP paid out about $65n in compensation, legal fees and clean-up costs, which includes billions for affected states. A judge ruled the petrochemical giant was “grossly negligent” in the lead-up to the disaster. Subcontractors Transocean and Halliburton were “negligent”, the judge said.The payment of the compensation money adds to the complex relationship states like Louisiana, which bore the brunt of the spill, have with the oil industry. The industry caused an environmental and societal catastrophe along the coast and is contributing towards the climate crisis that threatens more and more of the state with inundation each year.But the compensation paid has helped fund various coastal conservation projects and oil and gas remain major, and largely popular, employers in the region. Linder was only on Deepwater Horizon because the pay was four times the $28,000 a year he was earning as an English teacher.“I don’t think anyone realized right off the bat we’d have this unprecedented natural disaster,” said Chip Kline, an assistant to Governor John Bel Edwards and chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA).“During the spill there were some intense moments with BP but in Louisiana we have an economy largely driven by oil and gas it employs a lot of Louisiana residents. We try to strike a balance.”A decade on, with an incomplete recovery, coastal Gulf communities face a Trump administration that is attempting to reverse many of the safety-based regulations imposed after the oil spill. Residents are hoping this won’t lead to a repeat.“It made me sick to the stomach thinking about all the oil out there in the beautiful Gulf of Mexico,” said Kimble. “I hope and pray to God it never happens again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932a59f304fcdd8f09fff98cdc1ea35832d65ca8/0_106_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa482ae489cd83fc78921bf26ca81d0b","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

Testing was then restricted to those who were admitted to hospital, and contact tracing was stopped. The numbers of cases and deaths in the UK soared and a lockdown was imposed on 23 March.Hancock said on Friday that the government would rebuild the teams of contact tracers as part of a renewed testing and tracing strategy.His predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who is chair of the health select committee of MPs where Hancock was giving evidence, pointed out that South Korea had up to 1,000 contact tracers. “Public Health England had 290 people doing this at their peak, but they now say it has been wound down. Are we going to build it up again?” he asked.Hancock said yes and that contact tracing teams would be part of a strategy that included the use of a phone app to identify recent contacts and warn them that they might need to self-isolate.“The app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, to be able to assist iniduals to do contact tracing themselves by notifying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. And then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.”Testing, tracing and isolating the contacts of people with Covid-19 is expected to be a key part of the exit strategy for every country that has imposed a lockdown, as a way to keep control of the epidemic. Asked if he accepted that comprehensive contact tracing would need to be in place to lift the UK lockdown, Hancock said the government was working “incredibly hard” on the WHO-recommended strategy.“We do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible,” he said. “And we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people, and we’re building that resource, and obviously we need to have the testing and we’re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we’re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.”Earlier, Costello said the nationwide lockdown could have been avoided, with only the capital facing severe restrictions.He said the example of 10 identified cases in 300,000-400,000 people in Yorkshire meant that in such areas people could have continued to go about their lives and work while maintaining physical distancing.Hancock admitted the government had discussed it. “We did consider having a London-specific lockdown and decided it was better to do it across the country as a whole.”This was because people would be travelling between London and other parts of the UK and, he said, it was striking how the country had come together to observe the restrictions. “To separate one part of the country from another has downsides in terms of the national unity we have seen in the response.”Johnson’s spokesman later declined to say anything beyond Hancock’s words on the possible scale of testing needed to implement a full regime of contact tracing.He also declined to comment on why the UK did not isolate or trace people arriving in the country from overseas, while adding that this policy could potentially change in the future: “We’ve always said that we don’t rule out taking steps if that’s what the science advises.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0b6fcdf94d5f40c5427e82f3830e3f86446af25/75_169_4954_2973/master/4954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f8f1b8b5b6913eb023435223d279c40","title":"british muslims find new ways to be together for ramadan under lockdown","story":"With mosques closed, prayers are moving online and video conferencing apps will be used for iftar parties at sunsetAt Finsbury Park mosque in north London – once a byword for extremism, now a model of tolerance and community outreach – the first night of Ramadan heralds a month of communal praying, eating and charity work. About 2,000 people attend prayers each day. Volunteers cram into its kitchen to prepare iftar, the meal that breaks the Ramadan fast at sunset, for 300 people each night.Not this year. “We will miss all that,” said Mohammed Kozbar, the mosque’s general secretary. The building’s gates are locked, with only security guards patrolling its prayer halls and community spaces. “I visited last week. It was heartbreaking to see it empty and silent,” said Kozbar.The world’s 1.8bn Muslims are facing the most important period of the Islamic year, the holy month of Ramadan, which starts this week, under lockdown because of the global coronavirus pandemic.Mosques in most countries are shut and gatherings forbidden. The holy sites of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are under curfew. The al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem’s Old City are closed and prayers suspended.In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for the suspension of all congregational activities at mosques and Islamic centres on 16 March, a week before the government announced all places of worship must close under the lockdown order.On Friday, the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board said Islamic buildings would remain closed during Ramadan until the lockdown is lifted. “It would be deemed extremely irresponsible to congregate for night prayers or hold religious gatherings during this Ramadan in any mosque or houses with people who are not members of the immediate household,” said Qari Asim, a Leeds imam and chair of the board.“During the epidemic, the desire to perform prayers with a congregation in a mosque comes second to saving lives.”For Muslims, to be unable to take part in congregational prayers and break the fast with family and friends during Ramadan was “emotionally challenging, frustrating and culturally alien”, he added.Shelina Janmohamed, the author of Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World and vice-president of Islamic marketing at Ogilvy Consulting, said: “This is going to be the most unusual Ramadan of my lifetime and I think in the living memory of Muslims across the UK.”Like other faiths, Muslims are using technology to meet the challenges of lockdown. Ramadan prayers and the nightly recitation of the Qur’an will move online, and fundraising for charities will also be digital. Platforms such as Zoom are expected to host iftar parties.Guidance is being drawn up by Islamic scholars on exemptions from fasting for people who are vulnerable to coronavirus. Muslims working long shifts in essential services will “need to be pragmatic in their approach” to fasting, said Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB.“This Ramadan will be at a slower pace. It will give us more time for reflection and the opportunity to be closer to God,” he said. Instead of visiting different mosques every day, Khan will be spending Ramadan at home with his immediate family.According to Asim: “There is likely to be a tiny group of zealous people who may try to organise iftar events or congregational night prayers in their homes. My message to them is that selfishness has no place with God.”He also warned that extreme rightwing groups were “trying to use the pandemic to create ision” and were scapegoating Muslims for the spread of the virus.At Finsbury Park mosque, there are plans to distribute iftar meals to people in need or alone who would normally come in person. “People who volunteer with us every Ramadan are calling to say, ‘Please, how can we help?’,” said Kozbar.The mosque will be streaming lectures and prayers, offering online counselling and organising members to take food to staff at nearby hospitals. “This lockdown is something new for us, like everyone else. It’s a very difficult time, but we want to do our bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166158c02c85085904709d521aa6fc74549c9050/0_217_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=284c99c8b886eed1a606f395b2971c30","title":"business bosses coronavirus effect staff outlook","story":"Companies from FTSE giants to sole traders have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic. We ask four bosses how the crisis has hit, how they are managing and what the outlook is...Coronavirus – latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverageFor Lundgren, memories of one particular meeting underline just how swiftly coronavirus turned from a distant Chinese problem into an insurmountable block on aviation.It was 3 March and Lundgren was in Brussels for a summit of A4E – an airline association that includes carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, BA, Lufthansa, and Air France-KLM. The main subjects for discussion were airspace management and green targets. With coronavirus restrictions at that point limited to northern Italy, Ryanair said plummeting demand would be a short-term blip.Lundgren says: “I remember some companies were saying it wouldn’t have a big impact. And I said, ‘We don’t know anything about this. It’s very uncertain – you can never tell.’ I wish I had been wrong.”“First and foremost it was a public health issue, so the focus was on the wellbeing of our people and customers. It’s one of those things: when the virus first hits you and you get the first reported case, it becomes very, very real.”At this point, easyJet had only one reported coronavirus case among operating crew, and the airline does not know if they contracted the disease on board.The majority of easyJet employees around Europe have been put on furlough – just over half of them in the UK scheme. “We had around 14,000 staff, and now there are about 650 people working, almost all from home.”He holds daily remote conferences with his team and tries to communicate with the whole company via Facebook’s Workplace platform. He says those employees who have not been furloughed staff have never worked harder: “People are flat out … It’s the biggest crisis aviation has ever gone through.”For Lundgren, the main focus is financial – “getting access to liquidity, and to reduce the cash burn so we can survive and manage a prolonged scenario”. That has included renegotiating a £4.5bn contract with Airbus for new aircraft – a deal that has been the subject of broadsides from easyJet’s founder and biggest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who last week called for Lundgren to be sacked.The easyJet chief says keeping in touch with staff is vital: “Clearly there are a lot of people out there sitting at home, without work, concerned, who want to get back flying. You want to be sure that as we go through this crisis, you don’t leave them out. But it’s hard. We’re not getting everything right.”EasyJet has been criticised for not automatically offering refunds, and for being slow to cancel flights when restrictions meant passengers were unlikely to travel. Lundgren says the company has been doing its best: “You make sure you look after, as much as you can, your customers during this process – and that’s difficult. We’ve got customer call centres in countries affected by the lockdown, that have been operating with limited access when the demand has been very high.”The airline is maintaining – rather than mothballing – its fleet, so the planes can be ready to fly again at 15 days’ notice, and Lundgren says the airline is in daily communication with EASA, the European safety regulator, about measures that could be needed for flights to restart – from disinfecting planes to blocking off middle seats.“We need to do it in a way that’s safe, orderly and matches the demand that’s out there. But at the same time, no one knows what will happen.”Gwyn TophamThe coronavirus outbreak hit home for Jansen when he became the first FTSE-100 boss to be publicly confirmed as infected with the virus, in mid-March.At that time, BT had already started changing the way it worked in some territories. “We had started in China, Hong Kong, Italy and Spain at the end of February and early March, as social distancing and lockdowns were implemented,” he says. “Then it became clear that the virus was in the UK. We were a little bit ahead because of our experience in other countries.“The week I began to have symptoms, the advice was to come to work but keep your distance. I turned up to meetings with the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, and new Ofcom chief executive Melanie Dawes – and deliberately didn’t shake their hands.”At the end of the second week of March, when Jansen tested positive and self-isolated with his family at their second home in Devon, the UK had recorded only 11 deaths and almost 800 cases.“I had mild symptoms,” he said. “I was always up early, always working. My most important priorities were to keep customers connected and keep our staff safe.”He continued to lead the company and his first job was to film a six-minute video for the 120,000 employees of BT, which includes mobile operator EE as well as Openreach, which runs the UK’s broadband network.“We have 25,000 call-centre people, and we handle all the 999 calls – which have seen a massive spike. We have 30,000 engineers out there working on the broadband and phone network. They are all key workers, and at one stage we were 4,500 down.”One of the most serious issues Jansen and other telecoms companies are dealing with is the spate of attacks on mobile phone masts by conspiracy theorists who wrongly believe 5G technology is linked to the spread of the virus.“We have had 45 incidents, ranging from burning masts – about 18 – to barbed wire being put around fixed poles where people saw a shiny box and thought it was 5G kit when it wasn’t at all,” he says. “We have had people driving their cars at our Openreach engineers then swerving at the last minute to intimidate them, as well as verbal and physical abuse.”He is scathing about the conspiracy theorists: “ It is more dangerous lying in the sunshine than walking past a 5G mast. It is unfounded nonsense.”Jansen recognises that BT is not under the immense pressure that many businesses have found themselves under during lockdown. However, he says, its pay-TV operation is being hurt by there being no sport on air, and it will also be hit if many of the small businesses it provides telecoms services to do not survive.“The good news is everyone needs what we do,” he says. People need connectivity more than ever before. But we are not immune. The two big areas are BT Sport and the impact on small and medium-sized businesses, restaurants and leisure centres and the like. We can see businesses in deep trouble, and if they fold, that will impact us. But we will weather the storm.” Mark SweneyMorris first realised coronavirus could be a problem in late February, when a German company cancelled its marquee booking for a corporate event in London in June. “At that point,” he recalls, “we slightly shrugged it off, and said it was a bit extreme to cancel for June.” But it was only the beginning.Morris would usually be gearing up for the busiest time of year for his events company, which he founded in 2007 using his student overdraft. He had, he says, the “strongest order book ever” for his marquees, furniture and lighting.The company had been preparing to take on temporary staff and hire vans in April to take equipment to about six events per week, ranging from corporate meetings and outdoor opera to a food festival. Instead, he has lost £100,000 in cancelled and postponed bookings and has hurriedly tried to cut costs. “Our income has just fallen off a cliff. We are doing some work for the NHS, but it doesn’t really touch the sides.”Morris’s request for an overdraft extension from his bank – NatWest, part of Royal Bank of Scotland – was refused. He has subsequently tried to apply for the government’s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (Cbils), but the bank has told him his business is not eligible as it is “not viable”.“We have invested heavily back in the business, so we have made a loss, but that’s due to our investment. All our assets are fully owned, they are not financed,” says Morris. He claims NatWest has “stonewalled” him and looked only at Trafalgar’s accounts for the last six months, including the quiet winter period, which he says is unrepresentative.Morris had six weeks’ worth of cash in the bank before the shutdown. But four weeks after trade disappeared, the money is now running out. He warns: “We are not in a unique position, we will be one of thousands.”Joanna PartridgeA sunny Easter would normally have meant strong sales of strappy sandals and trainers at Kurt Geiger shoe shops. Instead, sales are down by two-thirds after the company closed its stores a few days ahead of last month’s high street lockdown.Clifford reckons it will take three years to rebuild to where Kurt Geiger started the year – on a high with record takings of nearly £400m, underlying profits of £40m and 10 new shops planned.It is hoped shops will be able to reopen in June, and summer stock sold in July and August. But in the meantime Kurt Geiger has slashed costs where possible, freezing rents and benefiting from the business rates holiday. It has had to cancel orders, delay shipments and try to repurpose materials, such as leather ordered for summer footwear, into styles appropriate for autumn. Despite that, it has mountains of stock which is unlikely to sell this year, though some will be held until next spring or summer.As the business fights these battles, it is also planning for a different future: Clifford believes this will accelerate the move to online.“It’s clearly an awful time for everyone. We’re going through five years in one in retail. Life has sped up.”Sarah Butler"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus glance","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:The coronavirus death toll in Spain, one of the world’s worst-hit countries by the pandemic, has topped 20,000 after 565 new fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours.The number of the total dead from Covid-19 in the country hit 20,043 on Saturday. The rise was slightly lower than Friday, when an additional 585 deaths were recorded. The number of overall coronavirus cases rose to 191,726 on Saturday from 188,068 on Friday, the country’s health ministry added.In the UK, the official Covid-19 death toll has passed 15,000 – with 888 new fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours. It means as of 5pm on Friday, of those hospitalised in the UK who have tested positive for coronavirus, 15,464 people have died.Robert Jenrick, the local government secretary, said during the UK’s daily briefing that a significant consignment of PPE is due to arrive from Turkey on Sunday, which will include 400,000 gowns.Hundreds of workers in Bangladesh have taken to the streets in defiance of physical distancing rules to demand unpaid wages during the Covid-19 shutdown.The country, which is the world’s second-largest clothing producer after China, is predicted to lose about $6bn (£4.8bn) of export revenues this financial year as retailers and brands across the world cancel orders.The government sent troops out into the streets to help enforce a shutdown on travel and restrictions on gatherings.Deaths in New York State rose by 540 on Friday, the lowest daily death tally since the beginning of April.Andrew Cuomo, the state’s governor, said new hospital admissions stayed around the 2,000-patient mark, which he said was still an “overwhelming number”.Meanwhile, Cuomo said “this is no time for ision” and that the pandemic was the “greatest challenge since world war two” following an attack on Twitter by US president Donald Trump.Iran allowed some businesses in the capital Tehran to reopen on Saturday as the country’s daily death toll from coronavirus fell to 73, its lowest in more than a month.So-called low-risk businesses – including many shops, factories and workshops – resumed operations in Tehran, a week after reopening in the rest of the country, state television said.Croatia is extending its coronavirus lockdown for another 15 days, but a minister says the country is exploring the possibility of gradually easing restrictions.Shops, bars, restaurants and schools were closed a month ago, with public transport also stopped, leaving open only food stores, pharmacies and petrol stations. People have only been allowed to leave their homes to buy essentials, seek medical treatment, go for a walk or do an exercise, but not in a group and avoiding social contact."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many cases are there near me","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Large studies of the prevalence of the virus within a region could play a key role, the researchers involved in the study say.“This has implications for learning how far we are in the course of the epidemic,” said Eran Bendavid, associate professor of medicine at Stanford University, who led the study. “It has implications for epidemic models that are being used to design policies and estimate what it means for our healthcare system.”The study marks the first large-scale study of its kind, researchers said. The study was conducted by identifying antibodies in healthy iniduals through a finger prick test, which indicated whether they had already contracted and recovered from the virus.At the time of the study, Santa Clara County had 1,094 confirmed cases of Covid-19, resulting in 50 deaths. But based on the rate of people who have antibodies, the study found it is likely that between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected in Santa Clara County by early April – a number approximately 50 to 80 times higher.That also means coronavirus is potentially much less deadly to the overall population than initially thought. As of Tuesday, the US’s coronavirus death rate was 4.1 per cent, and the Stanford researchers said their findings show a death rate of just 0.12 per cent to 0.2 per cent.Herd immunityThe study has been interpreted by some to mean we are closer to herd immunity – the concept that if enough people in a population have developed antibodies to a disease that population becomes immune – than expected. But the researchers behind the study said not to jump to conclusions or make policy choices in regard to the findings until more research has been done.The study confirms the widely held belief that far more people than originally thought have been infected with coronavirus, said Arthur Reingold, an epidemiology professor at UC Berkeley who was not involved in the study. However, it doesn’t mean shelter-in-place orders will be lifted any time soon.“The idea this would be a passport to going safely back to work and getting us up and running has two constraints: we do not know if antibodies protect you and for how long, and a very small percentage of the population even has antibodies,” he said.Even with the adjusted rate of infection as found by the study, only 3 per cent of the population has had coronavirus – that means 97 per cent has not. To reach herd immunity 50 per cent or more of the population would have to have been infected by and to have recovered from coronavirus.Further studiesIt is also unclear if the study, conducted exclusively on residents of Santa Clara County, is representative of the rest of the US, researchers said.“It is absolutely critical that similar studies be done all around the country,” said Jayanta Bhattacharya, a professor at Stanford and author on the study. “It’s very clear that the virus is more prevalent in some areas than in others, and understanding the prevalence of viruses in each region is a critical step forward to making some policy.”Other large-scale sample studies are currently under way in the US. The National Institutes of Health is testing 10,000 people. UC Berkeley is going to test 5,000 healthy volunteers to see if they have, or have ever had, the coronavirus. – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232589.1587227594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus cavan worst affected county outside of dublin latest figures suggest","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFigures released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre on Saturday compare cases to county populations. File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Cavan is proportionally the worst affected county for the coronavirus outside of Dublin, latest provisional figures are suggesting.While in real terms the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections in the Border county is a fraction of those in the capital, infection rates in Cavan appear to be much higher than in the rest of the country when measured against its actual population.The figures released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Saturday compare cases to county populations.They show 345 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Cavan, a county with a population of about 76,000, as of midnight on Wednesday.However, that would translate into almost 453 cases for every 100,000 people, making it the proportionally the second-worst-affected county in the State.Earlier this month, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) said doctors were being dispatched to work at Cavan General Hospital, after it was reported that up to 70 doctors and nurses working there had become infected with Covid-19.Meanwhile, in Dublin, there were 6,567 confirmed cases up to midnight on Wednesday, which represents more than 487 infections per 100,000 in the population.Westmeath ranks the third highest when comparing cases to county populations, with an infection rate of what would be some 358 cases per 100,000 people.The figures are in a report prepared by the HPSC for the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). It is titled Epidemiology of Covid-19 in Ireland and it notes that the data is provisional.Border countiesOther than Leitrim, Border counties all appear to have significantly higher rates per population than much of the south and west of the country.In Louth, which includes dense urban centres Drogheda and Dundalk, the confirmed Covid-19 rate per 100,000 population is almost 298 cases. In Monaghan it is more than 270, while in Donegal the rate is just in excess of 221.Sparsely populated Leitrim has a rate of almost 144.The figures compare unfavourably with parts of the southeast, most notably.Wexford has the lowest rate per 100,000 population, at less than 51 cases. That rate is almost nine times lower than that of Cavan, and a fraction of those of all the other Border counties.Waterford is the second lowest at just below 88.Even counties with large cities have notably lower rates of cases per head of population than most of the Border counties.In Cork, the rate is 174 cases in Limerick it is 176, while Galway is recording 103 confirmed cases per 100,000 people.Counties around Dublin all rank higher than the south and west: Kildare has a rate of 279 confirmed infections per 100,000 population Wicklow has a rate of almost 270, while Meath has a rate of 216.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232524.1587193998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish musician stuck on cruise ship in sydney feels forgotten","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKate Heneghan, from Co Mayo, on the Late Late Show. Photograph: RTÉ PlayerAn Irish musician has told of her struggle and feeling of being “forgotten” whilst stuck in her cabin aboard the Ruby Princess Cruise Ship in Sydney since the outbreak of Covid-19.Kate Heneghan (24), from Castlebar in Co Mayo, has been stuck on the cruise ship just outside Sydney for the past 28 days. There are five Irish people still on the ship, four members of the band Emerald Tide and an engineer.The passengers of the cruise ship got word on March 16th that the prime minister of New Zealand was closing the ports and no longer allowing ships to enter the country, which resulted in the ship making a three-day voyage back to Sydney, where 2,700 passengers disembarked on March 19th.“On March 20th, we got word that there were positive cases on board, so we were quarantined and isolated here then on March 21st,” Ms Heneghan said on the Late Late Show on Friday night.The Ruby Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been docked at Port Kembla in New South Wales since and has been linked to hundreds of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia and about a third of the country’s reported deaths.The violinist and harpist described her situation as a “huge scandal”. Speaking to the talk show host Ryan Tubridy, Ms Heneghan said her contract as a musician aboard the cruise ship was due to finish on April 4th, but she remains unaware to date of when she and the other band members will be allowed to disembark from the ship.“It’s a big political game of chess at the moment,” Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy, regarding the police investigation into whether there was criminal negligence in the handling of the health issues on the cruise ship.“We’re just pawns in this big political game and kind of forgotten about until decisions are made and we get news that we can disembark and get repatriated home.”“We were told via intercom by the hotel general manager, who updates us daily, that there was a possibility of us going to Manila to let off the Filipino crew. One of our sister ships is outside Manila and the Philippines won’t let them port. We also heard through the media that we might be going to the United States, which would be disastrous for us because we don’t have visas,” she said.Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy that her “one wish” for the four Irish in her band and the fifth Irish citizen on board is “to get off this boat before it sails away”.Despite the situation, the young woman was in good spirits and said “structure and routine” have been “absolutely vital in maintaining a bit of sanity”. Ms Heneghan spends her days doing yoga, practicing her instruments, watching Netflix and staying in contact with friends and family.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin is facing internal pressure from grassroots members of the party who say they should be given a vote on any potential coalition deal with Fine Gael.Local members of the party have expressed concerns that they may be denied a vote in the process and say it would be “madness” not to hold a postal ballot.Mr Martin on Thursday told RTÉ Radio’s Today with Seán O’Rourke that holding an ardfheis to ratify a coalition deal with Fine Gael could be difficult.He also said he didn’t think a postal vote would be “feasible at this stage”, adding that party rules say there should be an ardfheis.Party sources confirmed that the Fianna Fáil executive, comprising about 80 people, can make a decision on whether the party enters government with Fine Gael if a special ardfheis cannot be held. Such a move would be met with significant pushback by grassroots members, however.Lifelong party member Willie Kavanagh, who is based in Wexford, said that “every paid up member of Fianna Fáil is entitled to have a vote”.“Headquarters can just send a ballot to every member and it is a simple yes or no question. I don’t go along with the idea that it would be hard to have a postal ballot. Our membership is due at the end of June, and I’m sure they’ll find a way to remind us about that.Responsibility“I am not in favour of this coalition but I would abide by any majority decision,” he said.“I favoured a national government that could stay in power for a period of two years. If we go into coalition with Fine Gael, it is the end of Fianna Fáil. Who will be in opposition, it will be Sinn Féin.”He said that he believed Sinn Féin should be part of such a national government and said he believes “they have to take their share of responsibility. It is easy to make big noises when you’re in opposition”.Mr Kavanagh said that he has fought in, and taken part in, many elections and in February voters were being told that Fianna Fáil would not do a deal with Fine Gael.“We can change our mind on Fine Gael, so why can’t we change our mind on Sinn Féin?”Fintan Cox, who is a Fianna Fáil member in a Leitrim cumann, said it would be “madness” not to hold a ballot of party members.“What is the point of being a member if we can’t vote on something as important as this? If this goes wrong we could end up at 14 or 15 per cent in the polls while we let Sinn Féin take no responsibility. If Micheál had done a deal with Sinn Féin, he would be taoiseach by now. Now, Sinn Féin are off the hook and we are going to have a far-left radical government in five years.“So there should be postal ballot, absolutely. This caretaker Government could go on for months. We just need to give a yes or no and return that. They did it in Labour and for the Seanad.”He said he would have supported a national government of all parties followed by an election.“Going in with Fine Gael is putting the whole party at risk,” Mr Cox added.President of Ógra Fianna Fáil Tom Cahill said that a “number of Ógra units across the country have held their own votes on it, some as recently as last night, and so far all have voted to oppose. Our focus now is ensuring that a vote of the full membership takes place on any potential government deal that may be reached.Preference“We could still be a few weeks away from seeing a programme for government and it’s impossible to know what way restrictions will be at that stage. I think there will be logistical issues no matter what method is chosen.”He said a postal vote is his preference if a special ardfheis is not an option. “When we get to that point, I do think it’s doable but it may need a bit of creativity.”Meanwhile, the three smaller parties all held separate meetings on Friday to discuss the joint policy framework released this week by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.Sources in the Green Party say there are major concerns emerging about the lack of costings and detail in the document. Party TDs are drafting questions to put to the two parties this weekend.Concerns about the joint policy venture were also aired at a meeting of the Labour Party. Party TDs will further consider the document over the weekend before issuing a statement, but two sources said it is highly unlikely the Labour Party will feature in the next government.Meanwhile, the Social Democrats have written to Leo Varadkar and Mr Martin seeking clarity on how much borrowing will be needed to fund the policy measures among other questions about costs.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Coronavirus latest news: \u0026#39My colleagues need PPE delivered to the front line,\u0026#39 warns NHS medical directorThe uneasy alliance between scientists and Government in the face of the coronavirus pandemicElon Musk and Nasa team up for first manned US space mission in a decadeUS expert shoots down coronavirus Chinese lab theory floated by TrumpThese are the NHS workers who have died from coronavirusCaptain Tom Moore to open new Nightingale hospitalFear keeps people indoors, even where coronavirus lockdowns are slowly easedWatch: NHS choir releases cover of Mariah Carey song for charityTrump accused of \u0026#39fomenting domestic rebellion\u0026#39 by backing anti-lockdown protests\u0026#39I can\u0026#39t get an online home delivery slot - what should I do?\u0026#39 Coronavirus Q\u0026ampAWatch: Can you get coronavirus twice?Coronavirus cases in Scotland, mappedCoronavirus cases in Birmingham and the Midlands, mappedWhy are so many black and ethnic minority people dying from coronavirus?Matt Hancock\u0026#39s social care plan explained: how will the government tackle the care homes crisis?The British victims of coronavirus and their personal storiesFrom Boris Johnson to Sir Kenny Dalglish, coronavirus hits celebrities, royals and politiciansCan I get a private coronavirus test in the UK, and how much would it cost?Can I go to work?

It is vital for people\u0027s livelihoods that the UK economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery.Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the CBI, which represents 190,000 businesses, praised the Government\u0027s agility with the scheme and said its extension would help protect the economy and prevent unnecessary job losses through this new lockdown phase.She added: This extension means that firms will no longer be forced to issue redundancy notices over the next few days to comply with 45-day consultation requirements, and can instead return to focusing on protecting jobs and their businesses.  Frances O\u0027Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress said: Employers must continue to make full use of the scheme to furlough workers and protect jobs. There is no reason to make any staff redundant. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"meat20 ultimate humblebrag nostalgic relief","story":"A regrettable mullet or ill-advised denim may usually keep youthful photographs sealed firmly in the family album.But despite dubious hairstyles and recanted couture, the public and celebrities alike have rushed to display pictures of their cherubic 20-year-old selves using the viral Me At 20 hashtag on Twitter.Figures from Nigella Lawson to former Chancellor Sajid Javid leapt at the chance to join thousands of others in revealing their photos, and perhaps a psychological need.That this array of faded Polaroids shows youthful good looks along with the disastrous fashion choices, in what psychologists have termed a “harmless ego-boost”, might explain the popularity of the trend.But alongside this “humblebrag” of posting long-forgotten perms with equally long-forgotten chiselled jaws and bagless eyes, there may be a deeper psychology at work.Experts have examined the trend and believe there may be comfort in the innocence and perceived happiness of the past, despite the hairstyles, which contrasts sharply with the more menacing present.On Thursday the online trend erupted and famous faces in the UK were quick to show what they used to look like, as were thousands across the country. While the photos posted online may recall a time before fashion sense, they also conjure a period before career and family pressure, political upheaval, and a global pandemic.Such trends may also give a positive reprieve from the withering judgment common online, and a simple chance to show off.“There is definitely an element of nostalgia,” psychologist Dr Rachel M Allan told The Daily .“We have a tendency to look back to a time when we perceive ourselves being innocent, life feeling different, more free.  “We contrast that with how the world feels now.  Nostalgia can be a comfort.”In a time of isolation and reduced socialising, people can also rush to join a trend that allows them to connect with others online, Dr Allan suggested.Celebrities wading into an online trend may also have fueled interest and encouraged their fans to dig out their dated photos.  Along with social connection, the trend also allowed people to smuggle their dashing good looks into the public eye under the falsely deprecating auspices of a dodgy haircut.For those in the public eye who have become venerable figures, it might be a chance to remind the world of a vigorous past self. “For some people there might be a wish to show themselves having looked great,” said Dr Allan.“They may want to have a humblebrag.“And why not?  In terms of what else goes on on the internet, it appears to become a harmless ego boost.”The “what else” which often goes on throughout social media may explain why so many people felt comfortable engaging in what could be dismissed a narcissistic trend, but may in fact offer psychological relief.Psychologist warn that online discourse can often be harsh, judgemental, or simply insulting, leading to defensiveness and perhaps poor body imageDr Allan believes #MeAt20 offered a window of opportunity for rare praise.She said: “It allows people to show themselves in a kinder light.“It allows people to step away from the self-image they may have acquired from the pressures of being online.”In this spirit of judgment-free positivity, celebrities including Les Dennis, Laurence Fox, Carol Vorderman, and Booker Prize-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo have joined in.As with many internet trends, others have mocked the perceived bandwagon and posted pictures ranging from wild animals to Nosferatu to represent their younger selves. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no evidence people have survived coronavirus have immunity says","story":"There is currently no evidence to support the belief that people who have recovered from coronavirus then have immunity, the World Health Organisation has said.Senior WHO epidemiologists warned despite the hopes governments across the world have piled on antibody tests, there is no proof those who have been infected cannot be infected again.The British Government has bought 3.5 million serology tests, which measure levels of antibodies in blood plasma, even though they are not definitive of growing levels of herd immunity.Many tests being developed are pin-prick blood tests similar to widely used instant HIV tests and measure for raised levels of the antibodies the body uses to fight the virus.Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, Dr Maria van Kerkhove said: There are a lot of countries that are suggesting using rapid diagnostic serological tests to be able to capture what they think will be a measure of immunity.Right now, we have no evidence that the use of a serological test can show that an inidual has immunity or is protected from reinfection.She added: These antibody tests will be able to measure that level of seroprevalence - that level of antibodies but that does not mean that somebody with antibodies means that they are immune.Dr van Kerkhove said it was a good thing that so many tests are being developed.But she cautioned: We need to ensure that they are validated so that we know what they say they attempt to measure they are actually measuring.Her colleague Dr Michael Ryan said the antibody tests also raised ethical questions.There are serious ethical issues around the use of such an approach and we need to address it very carefully, we also need to look at the length of protection that antibodies might give, he said.You might have someone who believes they are seropositive (have been infected) and protected in a situation where they may be exposed and in fact they are susceptible to the disease.Dr Ryan said the tests had to be used as part of a coherent public health policy.The WHO is due to issue updated guidance on the issue this weekend.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"one towns collective trauma 1918 spanish flu saved another","story":"When the last deadly pandemic swept across America, the small copper mining town of Butte was particularly hard hit.The Spanish flu of 1918 claimed the lives of more than 1,000 of its residents - around a third of the state of Montana’s total casualties. The powerful business owners who had an interest in keeping the mines running refused to shut down, allowing the virus to spread unchecked.This time around, the town - scarred by the memory of the tragedy - has taken no chances.Butte, which has a large Irish immigrant population, was among the first to shut down bars and restaurants and even cancelled its famous St Patrick’s Day celebrations before the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the state.Most in the town have relatives who died during the influenza outbreak, or know people who did - a collective trauma from the past which has shaped the present.“Shutting down St Patrick\u0027s was like an earth tremor here but it was accepted with wisdom and understanding,” Father Patrick Beretta, the priest at Butte’s Immaculate Conception and St Patrick Parishes, told the . “I walked my dogs that day and I did not see a single gathering - a seismic departure from the wild celebrations of the past.”Father Beretta, who is studying how communities around the world build resilience, promptly decided to take his service online: broadcasting live on YouTube on Sundays rather than risk the health of his congregation.“We had closed our churches even before the order came to do so,” he said. “The trauma of 1918 is still haunting the collective memory of today. As a result people here took very seriously very early on the coronavirus dangers.”Residents began self-isolating long before Governor Steve Bullock declared a statewide lockdown. Butte has one of the highest rates of compliance in the country.Its swift action seems, at least for now, to be working: counting just six confirmed cases of Montana’s 208.The picture was not so rosy a century ago.The saloons servicing thirsty miners remained open, as did the brothels, allowing the flu to run rampant.At the height of the outbreak, 10 residents were dying a day in a town with a population of 100,000. Local newspaper the Great Falls Tribune reported “the undertakers no longer garage their \u0027death wagons\u0027, but leave them in the street as the calls became so frequent.”The high school was repurposed into a hospital ward and still, much of Butte remained open for business. The deaths only began to slow when the town finally started to close down in November 1918, nearly 10 months after the first detected case.The death toll ended up being on par with San Francisco and Philadelphia - two of the worst-affected cities in the country.“Mortality rate here was astronomical, largely as a result of the nature of mining life, confinement underground and above ground in overcrowded boarding houses,” said Father Beretta.“The Irish Butte inherited an intensely social culture. Churches, pubs, halls were always packed providing voracious vehicles of contagion.”He said the particularly rich “emotional landscape” of Butte was shaped by two defining tragedies and the recovery from them: the 1917 Granite Mountain mining disaster, which saw 168 miners killed in a fire, and the 1918 flu.It was also influenced by the resilience of the Irish after the great famine of the 1840s. The earliest Irish immigrants to arrive in Butte were children and survivors of the famine.“My town was one of the places hardest hit in America, in part because many believed the cure was worse than the disease,” saidKathleen McLaughlin, a local Butte journalist, quoting a recent speech by President Donald Trump in which he suggested ending the shutdown. “When you hear that reopening the economy is preferable to warnings of public health experts who want us to stay home and distance ourselves, remember the graveyards in Butte.”Butte, which now has around 35,000 residents, has rallied in recent weeks. Seamstresses in the town have turned their hand to making masks for medical workers, pop-up delivery services are ensuring the elderly and vulnerable are getting daily meals.Resident Sabrina Holland said its history of hard times gives people a greater appreciation of the need for a community to pull together. “Butte people have a sense of history that is so deep within us, that we see a current crisis as not a current crisis, but another thing to get through,” said Ms Holland, whose great-grandfather Daniel Holland died from the Spanish flu in 1919. “It’s such a Butte mentality. We’ve been through so much, we can survive,” she told the Montana Free Press.Father Beretta said that while the town understands the measures it needs to take, it has not stopped people suffering from the social separation that it has imposed.“The community hurts not being able to gather in sympathy,” he said. “But every day I think of the people of 1918. They are my teachers in coping emotionally with this pandemic, they are the teachers of the entire Butte community.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2020/03/10/TELEMMGLPICT000226965958_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth","title":"eight upsides two years social distancing misery","story":"Once planes are up and running again, you\u0026#39ll never again need to put up with your seat neighbour\u0026#39s sharp elbowsNot ideal news, certainly, for those of us hoping the latest Government lockdown announcement might allow for transcension of the exotic climes of our own four walls. Dominic Raab, our stand in-PM of daily Pret chicken caesar baguette (halcyon days!) fame, on Thursday night announced that we are to remain in our pens for at least three weeks more. A paper published in the journal Science this week, meanwhile, suggested that in order to prevent future waves of the outbreak taking hold, social distancing may need to stretch into 2022.Granted, two more years of bumptious park policing, pub-lessness and watching people stride towards barren grocery aisles while wearing lab goggles and a cycling mask, as I did from my second home of the supermarket car park queue the other day, do not fill the heart with gladness. But perhaps there are upsides to this whole enforced space thing, too. Such as:Planes keeping middle seats empty. Leaving the county, let alone the country, seems like the fanciful pursuit of a bygone era at present. But once commercial flights get back up and running, easyJet, and possibly others, will take to the skies with fewer people on board, leaving many (OK, a few) precious extra inches in which to luxuriate, free of neighbours’ elbows digging into your sides. Heaven. Will this send flight prices soaring? Undoubtedly. Though on budget airlines the real cost, of course, won’t be clear until the very last stage of booking, where a Pandemic Tax is tacked on as a “necessary extra”. Exciting!More civilised politics. Possibly getting a little ahead of ourselves here, but when MPs return to the Commons next week, they will do so on a 50-at-a-time rota. Which will surely make Prime Minister’s Questions marginally less aurally unbearable, given the reduced number of people there for simultaneous braying. Having said that, this slimmed-down political duelling could turn out to be worse than usual, depending on the screen time lags of those in digital attendance. Let’s hope they are not streaming on 5G.Scenery existing. Did you know that beautiful views lay beyond the swarms of people obscuring them? Revelatory.People continuing to wash their hands properly. It only took a pandemic, but people are now going to bathrooms and actually employing base-level hygiene after doing their business. Quite a thrill, not least because little bowls of nuts on bar tops may make a resurgence. And be safe for consumption this time.Learning more about friends. Not in any meaningful way, you understand – just how long Those Who Shall Remain Nameless continue to cite Covid-panic as a social event get-out.

Instead, the residents of Tadcaster, North Yorks, are being treated to the, er, provincial but in a fun way clip clopping of shire horses to drop off their booty. Samuel Smith, Yorkshire’s oldest brewery, is now delivering booze to patrons in a horse-drawn cart. “The children are absolutely loving it,” a stable manager said of the local youngsters, who wave to the animals trundling down empty streets. I am sure the Beaujolais-addled parents are quite fond too.The end of rush hour crush. It’s hard to believe a world in which you don’t get near-shoved into the path of oncoming trains daily could be out there but, should working from home become more widespread, those still travelling to the office may do so without fearing their lives will be imperilled en route.The end of studio audiences. An entire generation may grow up not knowing the sound of canned laughter. The young really don’t know how good they have it.Regional stereotyping is, obviously, reductive and wrong. There was a simpler social media time, though, in which the unusual, oft-criminal pursuits of Floridians (man breaks into restaurant to eat noodles and play bongos, man climbs down well to prove he can climb back out – you get the gist) was a running joke. We’re all Above That Now, needless to say.But I was reminded of how Florida can be a little bit, well, Florida when I read a news report of a disgruntled judge reprimanding the state’s lawyers for inappropriate dress when attending Zoom hearings. Let he among us who has not, in this newfangled working from home world, adopted the business on top, party on the bottom strategy to \u2028video call dressing cast the first stone and all that.For the lawyers of Florida, however, this has been less shirt and tie above desk, jeans below – more swimwear by the pool, general toplessness and, in the case of one female attorney, broadcasting from beneath her bedsheets. Not only in Florida, I’m sure. But possibly less likely in Faversham.“I’m a hugger!” – one three word combination, at the same time chilling and a helpful window into the utterer’s disavowal for personal space, that the pandemic has put paid to. For those seeking avenues in which to dole out indiscriminate touch, the Icelandic Forestry Commission has suggested a new coping mechanism: hugging trees, as opposed to humans.

Despite stringent containment measures, the couple say they are relieved to be in the Spanish town during the coronavirus pandemic.“We’re in total lockdown here. We can go out to the little local shops or take the dog out for the toilet but that’s it. We can’t leave Zahara – there are police roadblocks,” Mrs Browne told The .Spain has so far reported almost 185,000 coronavirus cases and more than 19,300 deaths. With a population of 47 million, Spain has the highest per capita death rate globally. Six miles north of Zahara a woman died after contracting coronavirus, and 22 miles away in Ubrique 16 people living in a nursing home died.On March 14, Zahara’s mayor Santiago Galván closed four of the town’s five entrances, the same day the Spanish government announced a nationwide state of alarm. A disinfectant checkpoint, pictured below, has been set up at the remaining entrance for any vehicles entering Zahara, such as food delivery lorries or tankers collecting goats’ milk from the farmers. A group of volunteers also disinfect the town’s streets twice a week.With its five hotels and 19 bars and restaurants, Zahara is a lively place and being sociable is the lifeblood of the community. Fiestas are a big part of the culture and, having been officially selected as one of the most beautiful places of residence in the Cádiz province, tourism is a central part of what keeps Zahara functioning. In normal circumstances, Mrs Browne takes their rescue dog Sprocket on long walks, soaking up the view of rolling olive groves or meeting other dog owners at the lake in the valley below the town. She catches up with people over coffee in cafes and the couple enjoy evenings out with friends. The mother-of-three also travels back to the UK frequently to manage cottage holiday lets and to see her now grown-up children.For now, all of that has been suspended.“We’ve missed the big Easter processions which are absolutely amazing. Everybody’s terribly sad about that,” said Mrs Browne.At the weekends a disco bus with flashing lights travels through the streets playing music for the children.“The little ones come out on their balconies and have a dance. There is also a round of applause for health workers throughout Spain every night where we all wave to each other,” she said.Not being able to enjoy her usual walks has been tough, said Mrs Browne, especially at this time of the year when everything is so green and the streets are scented with orange blossom. However, she and her husband, along with the other residents, fully support the restrictions.“I’m exercising at home and talking to friends and family over Skype and WhatsApp. I feel very safe here,” she said.Zahara’s mayor Mr Galván, 40, said residents have taken the action very seriously.The impact on local businesses is a big concern, but for now his focus is on ensuring residents make it through this crisis.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uneasy alliance scientists government face coronavirus pandemic","story":"Looking back, it was a moment that Sir Patrick Vallance may now view as regrettable.As he articulated the government’s decision to pursue a policy of “herd immunity” to the television journalist interviewing him, the Chief Scientific Adviser stressed that it was only following “the most up to date and relevant advice” from the experts appointed to navigate a way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.Herd immunity, he explained, would necessitate around 60 per cent of the country contracting the disease so that, once recovered, their bodies’ acquired antibodies would effectively protect the rest of the population, too.It was put to him that, with the virus having an estimated fatality rate of up to one per cent, that was potentially an awful lot of deaths to countenance. Sir Patrick couldn’t deny it.“That is a real prospect, this is a nasty disease.”Neither he nor his interlocutor spelled out the numbers, but anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that achieving herd immunity might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference.The PM had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for a week but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight the government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College, London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the Imperial team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the “herd immunity” press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that fully suppressing the virus with a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak towards the end of the year.“We want to…not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.”Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, the latest offering from Imperial had indeed made an impact and a seismic change in thinking was now taking place in the government’s inner circle. Actually seeing the numbers starkly on a page – 250,000 deaths unless we lockdown the country – had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television by the hapless Sir Patrick, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit of was now being actively considered in No10. The government was about to change direction, but it was hardly to be a handbrake turn.It was a full eleven days after the Imperial study’s call for full suppression before Mr Johnson announced that he was putting the country into lockdown. That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials such as food or exercise and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path.Why did it take so long to get here? Is it definitely the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the government in such times of crisis.SAGE, and the three sub-committees which feed into it, are comprised of a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats. This opaque nature, and the fact that the committees are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and particularly mathematical modellers, has led to criticism.Professor Anthony Costello, of University College’s Institute for Global Health, says: “I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians – and maybe citizen scientists – people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.”Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists. One report, submitted to SAGE on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various anti-viral interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be “highly disruptive” and “likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society.”Some committee members clearly felt it would cause to “discontent” to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said that explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them “will make this acceptable.”This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson himself, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister, “He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn’t realise was that every week’s delay on an exponential part of the curve can be a disaster.”Prof Costello points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races, as pictured below, in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error.His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered.“I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he’s the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.“I can’t believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it’s just the formula for spread.”Sir David’s perception is that, unlike in his time as Chief Scientific Adviser, when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more like the other way round with scientific advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor, he says, “It was very clear that he does want people to like him and as a scientist he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.”Having finally opted for lockdown, the government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily and depending too much on the mathematical modellers.Professor Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King’s College, London, says, “They went from almost nothing, which was \u0027oh, we\u0027re going to ban a few mass gatherings here\u0027 to the full lockdown, just like that.”Prof Sullivan says that he has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but that his pleas have been ignored. He fears those suffering from non-Covid-19 conditions will now suffer.“The mistake that was made was the models were not red-teamed properly, which means you give it to other people in other areas who model other indirect causes, you say what’s wrong with this model?...They were not exposed to a sufficient critique.”The problem with mathematical modellers, he adds, is that the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it right, of course you get it right, but if you get it wrong you can’t see you’ve got it wrong.”Whether Prof Ferguson at Imperial has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark.His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease was disputed.In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen the then agriculture minister John Selwyn Gummer attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date is fewer than 200. Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200 million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4 million.The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact around 19,000.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling.As the debate over the justification for the lockdown goes on, now the government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary. The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone a mask is not going to make much difference and can, conversely, make people less careful about keeping their distance while making them more prone to touching their own masks and faces.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our eventual exit from the lockdown. He says, “I’m envisaging in the coming weeks and months that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal – the Covid-ready normal – they will be wanting to wear face protection.”He says that after the SARS outbreak in Asia “people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second reason is to show to others that they’re taking it seriously.”The exit strategy is very much on academic minds. For this part of the process, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, Professor of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an advisor to one of the SAGE sub committees.“There is a space in the policy making that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics…you could argue there is a gap in the system of expert advice for that kind of input.“Modellers are smart people but they’re mathematicians primarily and that’s why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context. That’s why you need to have an understanding of the real world.“Ferguson for example keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all or nothing thing. Whereas if we’re going to talk about an exit strategy, there isn’t going to be a VE day where we declare it’s all over.”One problem, he says, is that “the government have ramped up the level of fear to a point where it’s very hard for people to hear the messages about ‘this is the way out’.” He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as “cruel and unjust.”“It’s a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.“If the politicians are trying to follow the science, and the science is only giving them a limited range of input, then it might be quite difficult for some of these everyday considerations to get taken more seriously.Prof Sullivan echoes some of those points: I think the fear out there is extraordinary. Now, it’s our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There’s been a real perspective loss here.“I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalizing again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.”In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people – and anyone they have had contact with - can remain in isolation, will also be essential. Only then, it seems, can the rest of us – with or without masks – realistically hope to return to something resembling normality.But with the government struggling to even reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine, which could take a year or even two to produce on the necessary scale. According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, “I’m afraid it comes down to this problem of, are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen?“Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.”After all this, herd immunity?But then, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer told the media last week, “The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.”Perhaps Sir Patrick won’t find he has anything to regret after all.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/17/17/macbook.jpg","title":"apple mac update battery charge life power","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Laptops may not charge up all the way all the timeApple is rolling out a new feature called battery health management that will change how laptops charge themselves.The update will mean that laptops may not charge themselves all the way up all of the time, if the computer believes doing so will protect the life of the battery.It aims to avoid a problem that means fully charging a laptop\u0027s battery puts a strain on it, because of the chemicals inside.

Even then the impact on spending patterns was immense. There has never been a month like this one. That being the case, goodness knows what April is going to look like.Overall spending through bank’s credit and debit cards, which account for just under half of card-based consumer spending in the UK, was down by 6 per cent with some notably deep troughs such as travel, including public transport (40.5 per cent decline), and restaurants and bars (35.5 per cent lower). Purchases deemed “non essential” generally fell by more than 12 per cent.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I misspoke,” he said.“As a heart surgeon, I’ve spent my career fighting to save lives in the operating room by minimising risks.“At the same time, I’m being asked constantly how we will be able to get people back to their normal lives.”He went on to describe\u0026nbspschools as “places of security, nutrition and learning” for children.Many states in the US are currently wrestling with potential timelines to ease lockdown\u0026nbsprestrictions without triggering a renewed spread of the virus.Donald Trump on Thursday gave governors a road map for recovering from the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic, laying out “a phased and deliberate approach” to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases.The new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations.They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public health in their states.Places with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools. In phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged.In phase two, people are encouraged to maximise social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume. Phase three envisions a return to normal for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.The guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.The Associated Press contributed to this reportThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

N95 and medical masks, which offer the most protection and are heavily in demand, should be reserved for health care workers who are regularly exposed to infected patients.A mask is effective only if worn properly, fitting snugly from the top of the nose to below the chin with no gaps. Masks should be worn the entire time you are outside and should not be moved up and down. While no mask is 100 per cent effective, it can help keep both you and others safe when combined with social distancing and regular hand-washing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHere’s a look at some of the types of masks you might encounter, how they work, what to consider when making your own and the level of protection they could provide.The N95 is the most recognisable and effective mask. Its name means it can block at least 95 per cent of tiny particles — 0.3 microns — that are the hardest to capture. An average human hair is about 70 to 100 microns wide.These masks, which are designed for single use, are made with polyester and other synthetic fibers, including layers of tangled fibers that act as a filter to make it harder for particles to pass through.Make sure there are no gaps between the edge of the mask and your skin. This one includes a nose piece that is moulded to your face. Many health care and other workers do annual fit tests that check for air leakage and ensure that masks are sized and fit properly. (If you have facial hair, you won’t get a proper fit. They don’t fit well on children, either.)Some N95s have exhalation valves on the front, which make it easier to breathe. Those masks are often used in construction. A mask with a valve should not be used in areas that are meant to be sterile, like hospital operating rooms.Medical masks come in a few varieties and are less effective than N95s: some filter as much as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of small particles under lab conditions. When worn properly, they can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching droplets when you cough or sneeze.Medical masks are often made out of layers of breathable, paperlike synthetic fabric that is cut into a rectangular shape and has pleats to help it expand and fit more snugly around your face. They are disposable and designed to be used just once.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile they can protect you from large droplets and splatter, their looser fit is partly what makes them less effective than N95s.With medical masks in short supply, many have turned to making or buying homemade ones. Depending on the fabric and how it’s made, a homemade mask can sometimes protect the way a simple medical version does. And any face covering is better than nothing.Trump: US \u0027king of ventilators\u0027 as coronavirus death toll tops 36,000A good homemade mask uses a material that is dense enough to capture viral particles but breathable enough that you can tolerate it.You can use materials like a heavy cotton T-shirt, flannel or a tightly woven dish towel. Material with a higher thread count – which allows very little light to filter through – will likely offer the best protection.Various patterns for making a cotton mask have spread around the internet. Look for one that has at least two layers of material, comes up over your nose and below your chin and has secure straps.Some homemade masks have a pocket sewn in to hold an additional filter.Coffee filters and paper towels have been tested. One experiment found that two layers of paper towels on their own blocked between 23 per cent and 33 per cent of 0.3-micron particles.People have been experimenting with filtering materials, including air filters and vacuum bags. They can be effective but can present risks. Many are not breathable and may contain harmful fibres that you could inhale. Also, the average person doesn’t need the level of filtration that these materials provide.Make sure there is a layer of cotton or similar material on either side of the filter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Before long, some balance will have to be struck.”Researchers have argued young people have been found to be less likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms, but are likely to be among the\u0026nbsphardest hit members of society economically from strict lockdown measures designed to slow the spread of the virus.The report estimated the proposed strategy would result in between 600 and 700 additional coronavirus deaths.Institute for Fiscal Studies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“Our new investigation has transformed archaeological knowledge of Roman Nazareth,” said Dr Dark, who has just published the results of his research in a new book Roman-Period and Byzantine Nazareth and its Hinterland.“For the first time ever, we are now gaining a reasonable understanding of the sort of place Nazareth was in Roman times.”By examining in detail all the archaeological evidence, gained from recent landscape-survey work and from a detailed re-analysis of previous excavations, we are now beginning to learn about the cultural and economic environment in which Jesus grew up,“ Dr Dark told The Independent.One of the most significant revelations to have come out of Dr Dark’s investigation is the fact that the farmers of Nazareth seem to have had a prohibition on the use of human manure as a fertiliser, in contrast to the people of Sepphoris and potentially many other areas. Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are still conducting testing where we can but there is a severe disruption, no question.”The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said a new self-administered doping test, where athletes are monitored live by a doping control officer, could help protect clean athletes, as the agency tries to ensure no one gets a “free pass” from reduced testing during the pandemic.Clothier said that though current testing limitations give dopers an opportunity to cheat, agencies should be proactive in identifying athletes prone to cheating while also cracking down on the root causes of doping.“One thing that needs to be understood though is testing for us isn’t just a numbers game,” he added. “We use intelligence and investigation methodologies to make sure we are testing the right athletes we need to at the right time.“While our testing activities are reduced at the moment, we are focusing on our priority and high-risk athletes and making sure we can test them as much as possible within the limitations we have.“We’re hoping that we’ll see change around the anti-doping world... where more organisations invest in intelligence capabilities so that they can address the root causes of doping and the people behind doping rather than just using the tests as a facade or a numbers game.”Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits.

Others said it was “natural, without chemicals, and safe to eat”.Alongside the popularity of southeast Asia’s wildlife markets selling a wide variety of animals for consumption, the trade in dog and cat meat has been rising over the past three years, the organisation says.How we treat animals ‘still risking spreading disease’Before the outbreak, about 10 million dogs and cats were slaughtered for eating in Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia every year, according to Four Paws.But its investigators said they had witnessed and heard how\u0026nbspsales of the meat in the region had risen during the global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email“We had expected the trade to be curtailed after the outbreak and in view of the restrictions,” said Katherine Polak, a vet and head of Four Paws’ stray animal care in southeast Asia. “But were surprised to find the traders saying business was better than ever.”The research teams interviewed sellers in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, and in the northwest\u0026nbspCambodian town of Siem Reap and capital, Phnom Penh.In Siem Reap, she said their teams found a few traders had closed, but those that remained were “rewarded with better business”.With each trader selling at least three dog carcasses a day, about 300 dogs are being killed in the town daily, they estimated.Illegal wildlife traders cash in on coronavirus with rhino horn ‘cure’China promotes bile from caged bears to treat coronavirus Indian traders ‘risking more viruses with squalid animal slaughter’ China bans eating wild animals including pangolin in coronavirus blitzExperts pressure WHO over live animal trade to prevent more pandemicsMeat buyers in both Cambodia and Vietnam told the investigators that the World Health Organisation’s\u0026nbspannouncement on cats and dogs not catching the virus prompted people to think that eating them was safe.“Our team who talked to the traders reported an initial decrease after the outbreak because people thought maybe there was a relationship with the virus, but the Cambodian government dismissed that notion after the World Health Organisation said dogs and cats were not a risk. The WHO\u0026nbspsaid that to prevent mass abandonment of pets –\u0026nbspbut it had the opposite effect.”Consumption had also risen because people staying at home want to try more “exotic” meat, Dr Polak said.In interviews last year, patients had told Four Paws how medical professionals had advised them to consume the meat for its “warming and healing properties” thought – falsely – to ward off flu viruses and the coronavirus.The meat is particularly recommended to women after giving birth and is said to increase blood flow for women during their menstrual cycle.Animals around the world benefit as coronavirus halts tourismBut a report\u0026nbsptwo months ago by the group, which has studied the trade in the three countries, concluded there was no evidence for any of the medical benefits claimed by health professionals.“Patients are routinely advised by health practitioners of the health benefits, and vendors are reporting to us that their customers are partaking in dog meat consumption due to the ‘health benefits’,” Dr Polak said, adding that she strongly suspected doctors were now recommending it\u0026nbspeven more in view of Covid-19.In Indonesia, people widely believe dog meat cures respiratory illness –\u0026nbsplargely asthma – so demand for it in that country could soar, Dr Polak said.The animals may be strays or stolen pets, or are bought by traders\u0026nbspwho exchange them for pots and pans.Vendors in Cambodia and Vietnam stand in masks at the roadside, providing bags of the meat, which may be cooked on the spot or for customers to take home.Dogs and cats blowtorched alive at Indonesian street marketsCambodia’s capital Phnom Penh has more than 110 dog meat restaurants, many of which opened within the past\u0026nbsptwo years, Four Paws says.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the organisation’s teams found that a few had closed but most had switched to providing takeaway services.And restaurants across the country are advertising dog and cat meat dishes for delivery on food delivery websites and apps.“This is concerning because we had never seen dog and cat meat dishes being advertised on a food delivery app before the Covid-19 outbreak. It demonstrates that the dog-meat industry is adapting to the increased consumption at home and increased ease of obtaining dog and cat meat, even during a lockdown,” said Dr Polak.“The insanitary conditions of the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many different animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases\u0026nbsplike Covid-19.“The rampant trade and live animal markets across southeast Asia are ticking time bombs. If governments do not act now and shut down these cruel markets, the next global pandemic might originate in Vietnam, Cambodia or Indonesia.”Last week China\u0026nbspclassified dogs as pets, not livestock, for the first time – a move campaigners hope could signal an end to that country’s dog and cat meat trade.Four Paws, which is campaigning for a total ban on dog and cat meat, has long warned of the risk of the spread of rabies from the pet meat trade.The news comes as The Independent’s Stop the Wildlife Trade campaign calls for an international effort to tighten restrictions on wet markets to reduce the risk of future pandemics.A recent study has proposed that the virus might have travelled from bats to humans via stray dogs.cat and dog meat\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Some schools are remaining partially open to care for the children of key workers.The provision is intended to ease the childcare burden and allow key workers to stay at work.The Department for Education has said parents should keep children at home unless their work is critical to efforts to combat the epidemic.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs. More than half a million people signed up to volunteer in the NHS to ease additional pressure during the outbreak.The drive had initially been for , people.Volunteers are delivering food and medicines, driving patients to appointments, and phoning those who are isolated.Volunteers are being asked not to participatethey or anyone  in their household is currently showing symptoms of the coronavirus orthey have an underlying health condition.Modern technology will make staying in touch with friends and family a lot easier than it once would have been.Among the options available are:The Government has extended the lockdown for a further three weeks after Boris Johnson first introduced the measures on March .Dominic Raab said the restrictions would stay in place until it passes five key test.He added that the UK was still on course to take three months to come out of the current peak — taking the lockdown to June.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And the moment before that.And probably every spare moment since he was obliged to leave the Sandy Lane Hotel, Barbados, to go through the motions at this old ITV circus, for the th time of asking.Britain’s Got Talent, which began with Ant and Dec sentimentally evoking all the things they love about this great country of ours.The White Clfs of Dover, Blackpool Tower, Edinburgh Castle, Russian sausage dog dancers, a Belgian contortionist, from Got Talent Espana, who scuttled across the stage in the spider position. That sort of quintessentially British thing.There was also, you probably sensed, a collective feeling Britain’s Got Talent didn’t just have a responsibility to lt the nation’s collective mood, over the following  minutes, but a moral duty.An unfair burden to put on any show and a forlorn hope, I thought, given the production has, for many years, involved nothing more inspirational than mixing and matching acts from the worldwide “Talent” franchise with the sort of homegrown sob stories which, however worthy and sincere, can feel a bit beside-the-point compared to the nightmare that’s just engulfed the world.And so it mostly proved on Saturday’s episode.Opinions here will dfer, I realise. In the latter category, though, we had a choir and foster care dancer Yakub, who won me over instantly with his modesty and tact as he announced: “My dream is to dance on . . . I’ve forgotten what I was going to say.” In the former, there was the Belgian contortionist, Papi Flex, an Indian dance troupe and Russia’s Diana Vedyashinka, who has spent the past  years teaching five dachshunds to stand hind-legged on a podium.An admission that made me feel slightly better about spending a similar amount of time watching EastEnders, but not much.There were also, of course, acts that fitted neither category, like James Piper, who’s “a personal trainer by day, magician by night”, meaning he can probably make haemorrhoids appear from nowhere.There was only one person, though, who genuinely lted the gloom.That was the brilliant comedian Steve Royle, from Phoenix Nights and Car Share, whose riotous act, pretending to shove ping-pong balls up his fundament, was funny enough even without the earnest health and safety caption from ITV: “Do not try this at home.” For five glorious minutes I forgot lockdown and began wondering about Steve’s next routine. Then I had to check myself.Because that is the sad and unavoidable issue with these BGT auditions. Unless they’ve got about  weeks of material, coronavirus means it’s a series currently going nowhere.Attempt to press ITV on this matter and all it can tell you is: “We are working with our production colleagues to see how we can make the BGT live shows work in an ever-changing situation.”Mind you, attempt to read Simon Cowell’s mind at the moment and I’m sure you’ll get a far more succinct response.“A jetski.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Which month of the year was named after the Roman emperor Augustus Hardball, Ore Oduba: “Which animal has large breeds called Clydesdale and Shire ”Ben Shephard: “On a computer keyboard the abbreviation PGDN is short for page what ”And Ben Shephard: “Gerald Ford served as US President in which decade of the th century ”A BALLSY move, I thought, for ITV to screen a drama comedy about Who Wants To Be A Millionaire’s coughing cheats during the coronavirus outbreak.The dark irony is, though, it was the only show this past week that was good enough to make me forget the ongoing medical crisis for its duration.The second assumption was that Quiz would stand or fall on Michael Sheen’s impression of Tarrant.It doesn’t. And that’s probably just as well, as it’s a slightly hit-and-miss turn. One moment he’s Tarrant, the next he’s Tommy Cooper, but he always looks more like Les Dennis.Luckily for Quiz, however, it barely matters because James Graham’s script sings and Matthew Macfadyen delivers a performance that’s worthy of award nominations playing the thick-as-a-brick Major Charles Ingram. There are issues as well, obviously.Mark Bonnar’s accent sinks somewhere between Stranraer and Larne as Celador boss Paul Smith and there’s an air of ITV self congratulation in the opening hour about Millionaire’s ratings.A dangerous game to play when you’ve now got Secrets Of The Driving Test filling the show’s slot.All is forgiven and forgotten with tonight’s brilliant second instalmentthough, which concentrates on the coughing episode itself and the fallout, as ITV execs try to work out who they should call at Scotland Yard.“It’s the Celebrity Crime Squad.”“Really  It sounds like a s**t detective show.”“It sounds like something we’d make.”Quite.Manny Monthe: “- is a dangerous scoreline because the next goal wins.”Ian Wright: “Pep Guardiola came in and literally cut Joe Hart’s legs off.”Gary Lineker: “Rafa’s comeback in the Champions League final was his finest moment in the Premier League.”IN the continued absence of live sport, the contest of the week was The Great Celebrity Bake Off, on Channel , where two veteran camera-chasers battled it out for screen time and the winner’s apron.A Holly Willoughby on This Morning B Princess Fiona in Shrek The Musical ITV’s hugely entertaining drama Quiz.

It’s no wonder so many bosses and workers are confused – lawyers are too!Without statutes in place and with regulations changing, it can be hard to provide a definitive answer. The Government has announced the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which means thatyou both agree, your employer can put you on temporary leave .This applies when they are unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of Covid-. If you are furloughed, you will be paid  per cent of your wages by the Government, up to a monthly cap of £,.It sounds straightforward, but your own unique circumstances can make things tricky.  I have been inundated with questions from people who have been furloughed, had their salary cut or lost their jobs.Here, I have provided my answers to some of your most common queries.Q I STARTED a new job shortly before the lock-down. My new company has advised me it cannot pay me the  per cent government pay because I didn’t start before February . What can I do A Annoyingly for you, your new company is almost certainly right. Unless you were on the payroll by February  they are not legally bound to extend the furlough scheme to you. There are talks about this being changed and lots of pressure on the Government because there are a lot of people in your position. In the meantime, you are entitled to Universal Credit — apply now.Q I WAS late getting to work at a food processing plant due to a change in bus timetables caused by the lockdown. My boss said this was a disciplinary offence and fired me. Is this legal A This is probably not legal. If you have been employed for two years or more this counts as unfair dismissal. If you took your employer to an employment tribunal you would have a good chance of winning.  If you haven’t been employed there for  months you would still be entitled to pay for your notice period.  It is possible you could bring a claim for breach of contract as your employer has almost certainly failed to uphold their own disciplinary procedures. You may also be entitled to a claim for discrimination.  Write to this firm making it clear the country is watching their behaviour — as am I.Q I AM on furlough but my employer is holding back a week’s wages I earned before I was furloughed, saying I will get them when my employment starts again. Can he do this  A Your employer cannot do this, unless it was agreed in a contract. You were promised this money and it has absolutely nothing to do with you being furloughed. I have had a number of messages about this unlawful practice and I understand employers are trying to protect cashflow. Butyou were promised this money your firm is not entitled to withhold it.  It may be that, like many others, you will have to work with your employerthey need that money to stay afloat and protect your job, but make sure they put in writing that the money will be forthcoming in due course. Waiting a while for the money may be better than your company going bust.Q AM I entitled to get another job – say, in a supermarket – while I am on furlough from my employer A I have been inundated with people asking this, but the law is not clear. My view is that unless the contract you have with your current employer specically states you cannot take another job , there is no reason why you cannot during this time. There is nothing as it stands in legislation that prevents you from doing this. The government regulationsare not clear and need clarication.  Importantly, disclosure to your current employer is critical. Do not accept another job without giving clear written notice to your current employer that you are taking up other employment while furloughed.Q MY employer wants me to accept a ten per cent pay cut. I checked my contract and I don’t believe they have the power to do this. Do I have a way of resisting this A Your employer cannot unilaterally decide to cut your wages. You have signed a contract and they have promised to pay you. But these are unprecedented times and there is legal provision which may, in certain circumstances, allow employers to sack you and then,necessary, re-employ you on a reduced salary. Multiple employers have asked staff to take a reduction in order for them to survive. The critical thing is thatyou accept such an offer it must have an end date, in writing. You can’t be forced to accept a contract change, including a salary cut. But be warned thatyou do not, your employer can put you on furlough, which will only cover  per cent of your salary.Q I RESIGNED from my job but my new one has fallen through due to the virus. Where can I get help  A I am afraid you will have to claim Universal Credit. It may be worth writing to your old employer to seethere is work still availble, but your legal remedies are limited. The Citizens Advice Bureau is updating its advice on this all the time.Q MY EMPLOYER has gone into administration. Can I still be furloughed A The law makes clear that administrators, independent professionals responsible for either salvaging a bankrupt company or ensuring creditors are paid, can apply to the government furlourgh scheme to ensure an income for staff. However, the administrator will probably focus on attempting to pay creditors and shareholders. Do not let them do this. Get together with co-employees and write to the administrator insisting you’ll not be forgotten and nor will their behaviour.Q I’VE HAD to cancel my holiday and my employer needs me to work during the time I had booked off. Usually we are not entitled to carry annual leave into the next year, butthey are requiring me to work, surely I must have the right to do so A Good news, the Government has amended regulations so workers can carry over up to four weeks holiday into the next two holiday years. This applies where it has not been possible for you to take some or all of your leave because of the virus. However, it has to be because you were required to work.Q I BECAME self-employed in February. Am I entitled to government grants A It looks like you are not, but this may change. You need to have accounts for   to be entitled to assistance. But this situation is moving, so don’t give up hope.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappeal Q I’M A zero-hours worker. Am I still entitled to be put on furlough  My employer is closed so I have no shts but nothing has been mentioned about furloughing. A The furlough scheme covers zero-hour contract workers so your employer should make an application on your behalf. Get in touch and ask them to explain their policy. It costs them nothing to offer you furlough so I do not understand why they have not.Q I WORK in a shop and my employer has made no effort to make the environment safe for the workers. In other shops I have seen screens at tills and employees issued with gloves and masks. We have none of that. I don’t feel safe. Am I entitled to stop working without risking my job A It is shocking that there are no specic health and safety regulations protecting workers like you which have the full force of law. I do not have a clear answer about whether you are entitled to refuse to go to workthe business is open and offering essential services. However, in due course your business failing to make the environment safe could be grounds for constructive dismissalyou were to make the decision to walk away. I urge you, in the strongest possible terms, to write to your line manager asking them to provide safety equipment, making it clear the environment is unsafe and explaining that you will be considering your optionsadequate safety measures are not introduced.Q I WANT to go on furlough, but my employer has cut my hours by half. How can I make them furlough me so I can get  per cent of my pay instead of  per cent A Your boss can’t just slash your hours by half, that is a straightforward breach of contract. If there is no work for you to do then furlough should be offered to you. Write to your employer at once asking for them to explain why they think this is lawful. I look forward to their answer.Q I CAN’T work because I have to shield myself due to health reasons. I asked my employer to furlough me and they said they couldn’t because I can’t work, so I am currently on unpaid leave. Is this fair A  This all depends on your circumstances. If you are able to work from home, and are healthy enough to do so, your employer should offer you this option. If your employer is unable to operate, or there is no work you could doyou did not have to shield yourself, then you should be offered furlough. Butthe business is an essential service that has remained open, and you have to attend work in person, the remedy is to apply for statutory sick pay .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Half of those , deaths are blamed on coronavirus.We do not know how the other half died, although some will have missed le-saving healthcare because of the ­pandemic.What we do know is that this hideous virus is killing the economy.The Office for Budget Responsibilitywarns a three-month shutdown will slash growth by more than a third, push unemployment up by two million and raise borrowing by an eye-watering  per cent.Lockdown has destroyed Britain’s “jobs miracle”, put paid to a fragile “Brexit bounce” and triggered what could be the worst depression in living memory.“It is important people know there will be hardship ahead,” warned Chancellor Rishi Sunak, an under- statementever there was one.On your one-hour daily exercise break, you can see the tragedy unfolding.Once-thriving restaurants and bars, busy offices and shops and key construction sites are locked and bolted.Behind every door is a personal and economic tragedy.Despite a torrent of taxpayers’ cash unleashed by Mr Sunak, many will never reopen. Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come. Some of it will be paid for in blood.Without cash from tax revenues, how do we meet Sunak’s pledge to fund — “whatever it takes” — our wonderful NHS and its costly new le-saving treatments The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCan we afford a generous cradle-to-grave welfare state, good schools or the promised infrastructure linking North and South with better roads and railways One day a vaccine will bring this miserable pandemic to an end. But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in. The public must consider it before it rails against any relaxing of the lockdown in case more Covid victims die.No one wants more lives lost. But the debate is not lives versus money and jobs. Many will also die from the hardships of poverty, unemployment, tax rises and spending cutsthe economy is kept paralysed much longer.The behavioural scientists advising the Government rightly fear that the public will doubt whether the lockdown’s success in protecting the NHS is still worth itthe recession it triggers kills thousands and destroys the health ­service’s funding anyway.We are not there yet. We do not yet knowUK deaths have peaked, though hospital admissions are flattening and the NHS does now look likely to cope.But the crunch point, where a date is set to slowly release Britain from house arrest, cannot wait much longer.Labour will blame the Tories, but all of these pandemic risks were pointed out as far back as  when Labour were in power.Boris, who became Prime Minister only nine months ago, was occupied with other matters until his December landslide.There are some “green shoots”, to quote one of our medical experts.The NHS now has spare capacity.

For example, the majority of the , Domino’s Pizza branches have a high rating – with  earning five stars - but one, in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire has just one.Manjaro’s come in at four or five stars – barring the Manchester branch at two - with the Preston outlet where Tyson Fury recently bought his £ family feast getting a top score.Papa Johns pizza chain has a more mixed bag - with three scoring one and one branch, in Northamptonshire, rating zero.The days of bowling into a McDonald’s or KFC and perusing the meal deals before ordering are obviously over, for now.The Food Standards Agency guidelines say all orders must now be taken remotely, eventhe food is being collected by the customer.When you go to collect, the restaurant should have a queue management system in place and you should only enter the building when you are told the order is ready to collect.Ideally, payment should be taken over the phone or online when you order butthat is not possible, contactless should be used. Takeaways delivered to the door come with their own risks but as long as the driver is following the government guidelines, there should be no issue.“The driver should not be showing visible signs for being infected with Covid-, such as sneezing and coughing,” says Sarah.“They should be clean and tidy with disposable gloves or sanitiser for hand hygiene.“The driver should ensure the m social distancing rule is maintained when making the delivery. This is easier when paying by card and avoiding cash payment at the doorstep.“Any food must be distributed in a way which ensures the food does not become unsafe or unfit to eat, says Sarah.In order to ensure that bacteria and viruses are destroyed in hot food, it should arrive on the doorstep piping hot – at °C or above – and in insulated packaging.Chilled foods must be kept cool during transport, at °C or below.In his latest Talk Radio QA, Dr Hilary Jones said hot food is safe to eat but you should be more cautious with cold.If the food is prepared well, it’s presumably been cooked thoroughly, then the virus will be killed off, he said.You certainly want to be able to trust the restaurant. If it’s salad,it’s cold food, you want to make sure it’s been thoroughly washed and prepared by someone who is wearing gloves.Once the takeaway has been handed over – ideally left on your doorstep to observe social distancing – it’s up to you to minimise the risk.Theof time the Covid- virus lasts outside a human host depends on the surface, with the World Health Organisation reporting survival on plastic and steel for up to  hours and on cardboard for up to  hours.So, while cardboard is slightly less likely to cause cross-contamination, it’s unknown whether it is completely safe.“It’s best to take the same precautions as when bringing home your food shopping,” says Sarah.“Wash your hands for  seconds with soap and water on entering your house. Then unpack the food into your own crockery and throw away the outer packaging. Then wash your hands again.“Don’t forget to sanitise hand touch points in your home on a regular basis such as door handles, taps , light switches and so on.”The coronavirus is sensitive to heat so it won’t survive in well cooked hot food.“If food has been cooked properly - at a minimum of °C for at least two mins -  and delivered in a hygienic manor, above °C, there should not be a risk,” says Sarah.However, Dr Hilary Jones says you might want to consider reheatingyou are not completely comfortable.You don’t know who has touched the packaging, who’s done the delivery, he says. You should take the food out of the packaging and you might want to reheat it. The FSA rating scheme also covers mobile catering businesses and street food traders.Providing you know the name of the vans covering your area, you should make the same checks as you would when ordering from a local restaurant.For new businesses which are not yet on the rating scheme, you should check that they are registered to sell food to the public and ask for the food registration number.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was backed by fellow Labour mayor, Liverpool’s Steve Rotherham.But the pair’s call risked a major backlash from unions, who warn that hospital staff are facing a daily battle to find the PPE they need.World Health Organisation official guidance says people need only to wear masksthey have Covid- symptoms or are caring for someone who does.And it adds: “WHO advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources.”It also warns against another of Mr Khan’s suggestions — that people reuse masks. Last night Chief ­Scientic Advisor Sir Patrick Vallance said they were looking at the evidence and hoped to provide clearer advice on masks next week.He added: “At the moment we’re entirely in line with the WHO recommendations. It’s absolutely crucial that masks are available in hospitals and in other settings which are high risk of transmission.“That’s where the evidence is very strong that they do work.”But while they are helping save lives, who is there to help them The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealCountries including Austria and the Czech Republic have ordered citizens to wear face masks at work and in public spaces.In Spain, which began to ease its lockdown last week, police and Red Cross volunteers handed out free masks at bus, rail and metro stations.In the US, New Yorkers were ordered to wear masks in public from Wednesday — despite President Trump vowing not to wear one.Angela Merkel has warned Germans they will have to wear masks on public transport and while shopping once the lockdown ends.And in Lombardy, one of Italy’s worst-hit regions, people must wear them outside. The French have been told to don them on trains until summer at least.But asked about Mr Khan’s comments, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC: “There is evidence that it could be counter-productive so I think it’s right to ask the scientists to provide guidance on it.“If the scientists come out and say, ‘Yep this is actually what people need to do’, then we will absolutely ask people to do that. But until they do that, that isn’t the message that we’re going to be sending.”Experts say all but expertly fitted high-grade medical masks can be largely ineffective.Researcher Paul Hunter, of East Anglia University, said public transport or supermarket workers might benefit, but added the protection offered “wasn’t great”.Professor Ben Cowling, who studied masks for the University of Hong Kong, said: “They reduce the risk, butpeople spend more time in crowds then that offsets the benefit.There are many practical issues to consider before everyone is asked to wear a mask outside the home.London’s Mayor Sadiq Khan rightly says it would be wrong to tell the public to buy surgical masks as this would massively cut supplies available to NHS and care staff.He suggests bandanas or other fabrics — but they can’t stop a mph sneeze.Masks need changing every three to four hours but just to give everybody one mask a day means half a billion a week are needed, requiring production of , every second.

If we rush to relax the measures in place, we would risk wasting all the sacrices and all the progress we have made.“We’ve just come too far, we’ve lost too many loved ones, we’ve already sacriced far too much to ease up now.”He added: “It’s been an incredible national team effort. Now is not the moment to give the coronavirus a second chance.“Let’s stick together, let’s see this through.”Despite other European countries easing measures, Mr Raab refused to set out any timeline on when the lockdown will end — dubbing that “irresponsible”.But he did offer a grim insight into government thinking that it could last into June.He said Boris Johnson’s scenario from March  of “three months to come through the peak is broadly still the outline”.Labours new leader Keir Starmer accused Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, of being reluctant to rubberstamp any exit plan while Boris Johnson recovers from the virus at Chequers.Speaking on BBCs Coronavirus Newscast podcast last night, Sir Keir said: I think that throughout this theyve struggled with taking decisions quickly enough.It feels as though theyve been in a position probably for a week or  days now where its been dficult for the Government to make big decisions.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.    Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weaposve had billions in funding for businesses, promises on testing and ventilators, new aposNightingaleapos field hospitals built in weeks, and help for the NHS and social care. Many of these announcements have been made at the daily  Downing Street press conference. But not all the utterances at those pm briefings have been quite what they were cracked up to be. Sometimes, journalists and the general public come away from the press conferences without having been given all the facts, which only emerge some time later on.So in the interests of public duty, weaposve analysed seven pledges that were made either in No, or by the government more widely, that didnapost quite happen as advertised. Ministers are of course working in unprecedented times, and some things theyaposre going to get wrong. But itaposs important to know when something hasnapost quite met the grade. . , tests per day A government statement on March  said testing for coronavirus would be ramped up to , a day, a level expected to be ready within four weeks. But at no point did the number top , - despite No claiming capacity had risen to , by April . The failure prompted furious recriminations, with Downing Street saying it was clear the NHS and Public Health England should fill capacity - but insiders blaming bureaucracy and poor planning for labs on the go-slow. Health Secretary Matt Hancock incorrectly claimed the target was set for the end of April, and superseded by a new target to hit , by the end of the month. But with testing still below , a day with two weeks to go, that , target looks like it could be in doubt.  . , tests per day... On March , the Prime Minister claimed the UK would be going hopefully very soon up to , per day.But Boris Johnson didnapost say when or how, and his pledge has never been repeated. Questioned afterwards, the government said the ambition remained but there was no set date for it to happen. ... And the millions of failed antibody tests The , included both antigen tests, which showyou currently have Covid-, and antibody tests. Antibody tests might showyouaposve been infected in the past and have some immunity. On March , Boris Johnson claimed the finger-prick devices would be as simple as a pregnancy test and have the potential to be a total gamechanger. But none of them have yet been approved for mass use, and many have failed completely, giving  results. On March , National Infection Service director Sharon Peacock said .million of antibody tests had been ordered - and she expected them to go through the approval process by the end of the week. This did not happen. The government has ordered several dferent designs of antibody test, none of which yet work. No refused to say where they were ordered from, but said it aposdoesnapost recogniseapos claims it blew m on tests that donapost work.  . aposAll key social care workersapos getting a test The lack of testing for NHS staff put the government in the firing line - so you can understandministers wanted to get ahead of the criticism. And on April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced: I can announce today we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested. But while it was great news at last for NHS staff, there was a crucial word in the statement - key. While all NHS staff with symptoms could get tested, the same was not yet true at that point of all staff in care homes. The discrepancy prompted fresh claims that social care staff were being treated like second-class carers.At the time of Mr Hancockaposs announcement, not only could they not all get a test - they also faced new residents coming in from hospital without being tested either. Both those situations were remedied the next week. But care home deaths still arenapost included in daily statistics, which means they risk becoming a forgotten factor of the outbreak.. aposNew proceduresapos on the right to say goodbye Matt Hancock pledged to end the indignity of coronavirus victims dying alone due to isolation rules. The Health Secretary announced on April : Iaposm pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving peopleaposs closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye. He highlighted the tragic case of -year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, whose death alone made me weep. But while no-one could argue with the principle Mr Hancock was trying to achieve, it emerged these new procedures were largely not new rules on April . They were more of an order to obey rules already in place.  Both the care sector and hospitals had already been sent Covid- guidance saying visits should not take place - with an exception for people in end-of-le care. But government sources admitted the guidance wasnapost being adhered to, forcing Mr Hancock to make a new statement. The advice for hospitals had been issued on April . It said: Visiting is suspended with immediate effect and until further notice. The only exceptional circumstances where one visitor - an immediate family member or carer - will be permitted to visit [include]: The patient you wish to visit is receiving end-of-le care.” The guidance for care homes was issued on April . A new aposaction planapos for care homes on April  simply reinforced the fact visits can be paid for end-of-le care.  . The aposfirst of thousandsapos of new ventilators On March , Michael Goveannounced the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line on the weekend, and be delivered to the NHS next week. But while , of the Penlon ventilators were indeed ordered, Mr Gove did not clary exactly how many would roll off the production line that week. The next day, the government claried the initial number was in fact in the region of . Officials insisted potentially hundreds more could arrive in the weeks afterwards. The Penlon devices were part of a ventilator challenge urging UK firms to produce hastily-designed breathing apparatus.However, unlike orders for entirely new ventilators from firms like Dyson, the Penlon devices were a re-working of a design of ventilator already in use. As of April , itaposs not known that any other models from the UK challenge have yet been approved for use.. , in a week - and more ventilator questions Questioned on April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there should be another , ventilators in the next week. A week later, Downing Street said the figure had been . Supporters of the government would say the exact number doesnapost matter when, as of April , the government insists there is plenty of ventilator capacity in the NHS. But there are more discrepancies in the numbers, and critics would say they raise questions over the overall strategy. For example, Mr Hancock was originally hoping to raise the nationaposs , ventilators to , - but revised the figure down to , after lockdown measures began working. A few weeks ago, government officials told the Mirror there were , ventilators in place, , more aposoff-the-shelfapos models on order - and plus any from the UK challenge. Yet on April , Downing Street said that while the number in place was now ,, just , were on order. Where did the other , on order go  We donapost know.  . A badge for carers Amid negative news stories about the governmentaposs response on social care, Matt Hancock announced on April  a badge for care workers. This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identy themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo, he said. I know that many businesses will want to offer the same recognition and benefits as they do wonderfully to the NHS.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHow well has the Government handled coronavirus  The outbreak is the biggest ­challenge faced by the country since the Second World War. It has required a huge economic bailout and an immense effort by the NHS, care staff and other key workers.But has the response by Boris Johnson ’s administration been adequate Here our experts look at what the Government got right and what they got wrong, and deliver their verdicts. Lockdown WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT We managed to introduce lockdown measures without shutting vital public spaces. This approach has managed to maintain extremely high levels of public support for the measures. Covid- victims are infecting on average fewer than one person each – the crucial “R” reproduction number threshold which,social distancing is maintained, will kill off the outbreak. This has been achieved while keeping most parks open and allowing daily exercise. By contrast, Italy shut public spaces entirely from mid-March, which exacerbated mental health problems in the population. No also made a good call in using experts to sell its social distancing message. England’s Chief Medical Officer Prof Chris Whitty and Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance have been vital in maintaining public trust. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG We introduced lockdown measures slower than almost all of Europe. The Government’s mantra on this is that it is “guided by the science” – but in reality, such decisions are a judgment call by politicians. The Prime Minister and his Cabinet decide which experts on its Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies to listen to most and then interpreted their advice. In mid-January, when China locked down Wuhan, few thought it would happen in liberal Europe. By early March, many countries were shutting down. But here, Boris Johnson was still joking about shaking hands with patients on a hospital visit. The PM and his team got updated modelling that triggered a U-turn on March . Data from Italy suggested that unless we were also locked down immediately, , people would die in a matter of months. Now, our death rate per capita is twice that in Ireland and we are tipped to have Europe’s worst outbreak. VERDICT An increasing number of experts believe we acted too slowly – but a final assessment is only possible with full data after the pandemic. Testing WHAT THEY GOT RIGHTWe were one of the first countries to develop its own coronavirus test.Public Health England’s swab test was used to contain the outbreak as patients were isolated after ing from abroad. Detailed contact tracing was then carried out so everyone in contact with a confirmed case could also be isolated. This delayed widespread community transmission and is the main reason we are two or three weeks behind the likes of Italy and Spain in outbreak trajectory. Hospital bed numbers were low at the start of the outbreak but this swt action bought the NHS time, enabling temporary Nightingale hospitals to be set up. Intensive care was also kept within capacity in the first wave. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG The March  decision to abandon widespread community testing shocked scientists. This was the start of the much-disputed “herd immunity” phase of the strategy. It went directly against World Health Organisation advice for governments to “test, test, test”. The decision came amid an initial clamour for tests by the general public from GPs. From this point, only the most seriously ill patients in hospitals were tested. It soon became clear other countries were outstripping our testing capacity. Germany was achieving remarkably low death rates after scaling up testing using private labs. The UK decided to initially only use PHE’s Colindale lab before some NHS labs were kitted out to do swab analysis. While we were withdrawing from the arms race on testing, other countries were building up supplies needed to analyse the swabs. And as the Government came under pressure to ramp up testing, lack of supplies hampered efforts. VERDICT The decision to axe community testing and contact-tracing means we have no reliable data on how widespread Covid is outside of hospitals – which could delay an end to lockdown. PPE - personal protective equipment    WHAT THEY GOT RIGHT The Government says we have enough personal protective equipmentfor all who need it. But it admits there have been distribution problems, hampering efforts to deliver equipment where it needs to go. Since the beginning of the outbreak,  million pieces of PPE have been delivered to the front line. The Royal College of Physicians has said a combination of revised PPE guidance issued two weeks ago by Public Health England, plus the NHS drive to get millions more pieces of kit to the front line, had made a big impact on the shortages and helped to allay the fears of workers. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG To frontline doctors and nurses, it doesn’t really make a dference what caused the problem. Hospital trusts are reporting “critically low” supplies, with the British Medical Association reporting “dangerously low levels” in some parts of the country. A survey by the Royal College of Surgeons found a third of surgeons did not have access to enough masks, gowns and other equipment. And a BMA survey last week found half of doctors felt pressured to work in high-risk areas despite not having adequate PPE. VERDICT Whatever the cause of the shortages, the Government either did not recognise the scale of the problem or it did not respond to it quickly enough. The economy    WHAT THEY GOT RIGHTIT is a month since Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s Budget pledge of £billion for coronavirus-hit companies.Smaller firms were promised emergency cash through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme while big companies could access funds via the Covid Corporate Financing Facility. That is without the Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, where firms can reclaim % of workers’ wages, up to £, a month. WHAT THEY GOT WRONG ONLY just over , smaller firms have had loans through the CBILS, out of , that managed to apply. There have been more than , enquiries. Banks are accused of failing to respond, dragging their feet, making business owners jump through hoops, or in some cases unfairly rejecting applications.  Around £.billion of CBILS loans have been approved. Together with the £.billion loaned through the CCFF, it is .% of the £billion earmarked by the Chancellor. Amid criticism, Mr Sunak has now launched the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme for firms that could not access either pot of money. VERDICT The Job Retention Scheme could be a game-changer in preventing millions more workers getting the chop. But the go-slow on loans for firms is a cause for concern, especially with , companies already in trouble.

Health Secretary Matt ­Hancock proudly announced that although they wouldn’t be getting any more protective equipment, he was sending each of them a lovely badge that says “CARE”. This is what they have been crying out for. Gowns and gloves stop you getting horribly sick but they’re BORING. Other countries have tried to help their medical staff by testing them for the virus. But what use are teststhere’s no badge  This is why in Germany, care workers are all protesting, saying: “The tests might keep us alive butwe haven’t got a badge, is there anything to live for anyway ” Next week Matt Hancock will be even more generous to our nurses. If they’re still working as hard, instead of face masks, he might send them each a beer mat with ‘‘Angel” written on it that they can keep forever. Then,a doctor has completed a -hour sht and doesn’t complain about not having enough masks, he’ll get a fun helium balloon, like the sort you get when you’ve had a baby. Instead of “It’s a girl” or “It’s a boy”, it will have “It’s a knackered doctor” on the side. This will even be practical, as the balloon can be used when there’s a shortage of ventilators.  Patients can suck in the helium which will not only help them to breathe but also ask for paracetamol in a funny high-pitched squeak, lting the spirits of everyone in the ward. Although the staff say they haven’t got enough protective equipment, Matt Hancock says this is because the nurses waste them by changing too often. This was clearly the problem all along. The nurses keep trying on dferent outfits until they find the right style of plastic gloves to go with their skin shade. Or they complain, “This patient coughed over my gown so now it clashes with my face mask”, and get changed yet again. Hopefully the medical staff will change their attitude and realise now is not the time to worry about looking smart.  Matt Hancock also said he was delighted with the way we cheer the staff every Thursday and was “proud that health workers are held in such high esteem”. The Conservatives have always been like that, cheering health workers. For example, they cheered them when the Bill was passed to prevent their pay rise. “Hoorah, our health workers will stay broke and have to go to the food bank, hip hip hooray”, they cheered.

On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that the country would need to stay at home for a further three weeks. But there’s thought to be some disagreement in the Cabinet over whether lockdown restrictions should be lted on May  or whether they should remain in place into June. The first scenario would mean restrictions are lted earlier, in the hope it would cause much less damage to the economy – but would risk a second virus ‘peak’. Butlockdown is extended into early summer – it is expected to push numbers of coronavirus cases right down – but would risk further damage to the economy. It’s believed some ministers are unhappy that there has not been a proper debate about the two options, according to the Daily Mail. Scientists say extending the lockdown into the summer would drastically reduce transmission rates and the ‘extremely low’ level of cases would make it easier for health officials to manage the pandemic.  But this approach means the economy would continue to stall. Meanwhile, Tory former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Government should stop treating people like children by refusing to discuss exit strategies for ending the lockdown. He told the Times: The Government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children. We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point in an economic sense.  Labour leader Keir Starmer has claimed an appropriate exit strategy from lockdown is ‘in limbo’ while Boris Johnson recovers from coronavirus. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said that claim was just wrong. Keir Starmer said ministers are failing to take decisions on when and how tothe UK to normal le - and suggested the government has not acted “quickly enough” throughout the crisis. He added: “I suspect, although I donapost know, that  Dominic Raab  is just reluctant - he probably does know that itaposs time for an exit strategy - but heaposs probably reluctant to sign it off without the Prime Minister and I think thereaposs a bit of that in the mix.” "},{"url":null,"title":"union leader says matt hancock","story":"NewsUnion leader says Matt Hancock may have to consider his position over PPE failuresThe union GMB has slammed the health secretarys gross ministerial incompetence as its members struggle on the NHS front lines without protective kit to do their jobs safelyShareByAlan Jones:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video matt-hancock-says-not-prepared-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news politics union-leader-says-matt-hancock-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced in todayaposs daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing  very large consignment of personal protective equipment - including , gowns - is due to arrive in the UK from Turkey tomorrow. But the NHS is currently using , gowns a day - meaning the new shipment will last just days. Earlier, Rachel Harrison, national officer of the GMB, said the union raised critical protective equipment supply issues with the Government more than a month ago. It took until last Friday for ministersapos PPE plan to be published, and itaposs falling apart after just a week. It is key workers on the front line who are paying the price for this litany of failure. It appears Government guidance is being hastily redrawn based on availability, not on evidence or best practice. This is downright dangerous territory and one that will amply the concerns of NHS staff. The Health Secretary now has serious and urgent questions to answer. Trust is draining away. He must urgently explain how this apparently non-clinical decision was made to downgrade public health advice in apparent contravention of global standards and previous advice. GMB wonapost tolerate a situation where our members are pushed on to the front line without the basic kit they need to do their jobs safely. NHS and ambulance staff will now face unacceptable risks as a result of gross ministerial incompetence. We wonapost let this go unchallenged and will now review the steps we need to take protect our members.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: The continued lack of PPE is a national scandal and the Governmentaposs litany of broken promises over the last month is shameful. The public is looking on aghast as brave doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are risking their lives to provide care to very sick patients - yet they donapost have the necessary protection to carry out their roles. Health Secretary Matt Hancock needs to sort out the logjam in PPE supplies urgently, otherwise he may have to consider his position as this situation canapost continue, as health professionals would be quite right to decline to put themselves in danger. This would go against every instinct in their body and every tenet of their professional training, but already the public is very alarmed at the rising toll of NHS staff who have died due to coronavirus as they have battled the pandemic. We are not just talking about NHS staff in hospitals, but those working in the community, such as health visitors and community nurses, and those employed in social care settings, such as care homes.

Everyone is being told to stay at home and only go out when they absolutely have to for essential items like food and medication and for exercise once a day. Pubs, cafes and restaurants have been closed, along with schools and theatres. Long queues have formed outside supermarkets with retailers struggling to keep shelves stocked with many of the goods weaposve all come to expect to be readily available. And with people spending all their time at home, unable to go out to eat and often without many ingredients that used to be readily available, providing exciting and delicious meals is a challenge.  But Damian Adams, Head Chef at The Jockey Club’s Newmarket and Huntingdon Racecourses, has come up with five simple tips to ensure you can make the most of your lockdown meals. He explained: These are unprecedented times but there is one thing that will always be certain - we all need to eat. So, as we continue le in lockdown it’s important we start to get better at planning meals. This won’t just help save money, it’ll cut down on food waste, too. One of the key things, says the respected chef, is to make sure you only buy what you need - this will not only make meal planning easier but also help you cut down on waste. Damian said: There are some simple things we can do to control our food waste at home. For instance, just about any vegetable can be turned into soup, portioned up and then stashed away in your freezer for when you want it. And he said lockdown is the perfect time to spend longer cooking your meals than usual because you longer have a pesky commute to contend with. Damian said: When we’re flat out working it’s easy to see making meals as a bit of a chore. So, whether you’ve got more time on your hands or just using the part of the day you’d usually spend commuting, try to put a bit more love and time into your food. I promise you’ll reap the benefits. The biggest dference we can make is when planning out our meals in advance. Here are Damianaposs five key points to help you make the most of what youaposve already got in your cupboards, fridges and freezers.

Many of you across TfL are working flat out in support of the services and other work we must deliver in order to defeat this virus. There are, however, other areas where work has been reduced or paused while we focus on this. So, from the beginning of next week, line managers will be having discussions with colleagues where this is the case or who are unable to work from home about going on furlough. In cases where this happens, the memo says, staff salaries would be topped up, with the government paying % and TfL paying the remaining %.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma branded it a colossal undertaking, and said that evena vaccine is found, it will need extensive testing. It comes as scientists from Oxford University said they were confident they could have a vaccine available by September.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email These are the first pictures inside a make-sht mortuary that was built in less than a week to increase capacity during the coronavirus.The site in Bristol is designed to deal with a potential extra demand for a dignied site where bodies can be stored ahead of funerals. The marquee, which has been built at a vehicle depot, can accommodate up to  bodies. It was completed earlier this week and contains six chilled containers that are covered by a large gazebo. Faith leaders and a humanist gathered for a ceremony today to offer thoughts and prayers for those who might need to use the site and their families during the pandemic. The event was also attended by Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees. Mr Rees said: “This is a dficult time for everyone in our city and we know the reason for building this place of rest is distressing for our communities. It’s important we take all preparations necessary so we can provide a dignied place to rest for citizens who sadly lose their lives during the Covid- pandemic. “Today’s event exemplied kindness, respect and dignity. It’s reassuring to see representatives from a range of faiths and non-faiths coming together today. I hope it gives some comfort to all our residents that we will do all we can to support each other through this dficult time. “We stand with people from all faiths and no faith because We Are Bristol together.” Hospitals across the UK have increased their general capacity for patients who died over the last few weeks but local councils have been working to be preparedfurther space is needed. This was one of the first times members of the public have been allowed inside. The council said they allowed dferent faiths from across the city to view the site as they wanted to be open and transparent about the preparations it was making. Representatives from dferent religions gave a prayer while a leading humanist also gave a reading to a small gathering inside.  Although no funeral services will take place at the site, Bristol City Council said it held the ceremony so faith and non-faith representatives can help bereaved people better understand the process. The council said it had been quickly established to ensure sufficient capacity to allow for dignity and respect to be maintained before funerals are held. Attendees at the event included The Bishop of Bristol Vivienne Faull virtually over Zoom, The Buddhist Chaplin at the University of Bristol, Sister Jinho, Humanist Celebrant Chrissie Hackett, and Zaheer Shabir, represented the Muslim community. A number of other faith leaders, unable to attend in person, also joined the ceremony by Zoom, including Rabbi Monique Mayer and Hindu representative, Shiv Sama. Restrictions will be in place at the site to protect staff who will be offered continued emotional support.  The site is not yet in use and Bristol City Council has written to neighbours around the site to keep them informed. The tented site is located off a residential street, but vehicles will reverse into a covered area to ensure all dignity is maintained. Those transporting the body would stop at an infection control point and the deceased would be transferred in the same way as a traditional mortuary to be stored in one of six refrigerated containers until they are removed for a funeral. There is a three pronged walkway for staff to use to ensure infection control and PPE wearing is carried out and strict instructions on following safety measures. Mortuary and coroneraposs support manager for Bristol City Council John Pitchers, said: The purpose-built facility is to ensure there is sufficient capacity to continue to look after the deceased in a way that ensures dignity and respect. We all hope it is never needed butit is, it is vital that we can continue to deliver the same care.  It is designed to be as close as possible to a traditional morgue. Within the containers are the same wrappers as in a permanent one. The procedures are all the same and anyone using it will be moved around with the same equipment. They are kept safe and the level of security is the same. It is essentially ready now but we are limited to the number of people we can accommodate until the racking is here which is due to arrive at the end of next week. Any deceased comes through the main door and there is strict infection control. The van reverses and the bodies are transferred into the temporary resting place. There is a three stage process for staff with walkways to ensure all safety measures are carried out. Bristol City Council said it originally purchased containers which could accommodate  deceased during usual operation.

After a year which came close to her “annus horribilis” of , Her Majesty has  put personal woes to one side, leading from the front as we languish in lockdown. Where there has been fear, Elizabeth has brought courage. With reassuring calmness, she has lted our spirits. Yes, we may be in times of darkness, but brighter days lie ahead. The Queen, who will be  on Tuesday, has united the country once more – as she has done so many times in her -year reign. But there will be no great birthday fanfare. Traditional gun salutes in royal parks were cancelled and while public buildings can fly the flag they are not forced tosocial distancing rules prevent it. The Palace said: “Her Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances.” A social media post will mark the day on Tuesday, but any phone or video calls with family will be private. Her Majesty’s response is in keeping with the stoicism and sheer common sense she has shown after a punishing period which tested her resolve. Last year was especially dficult for her husband Prince Philip after a car crash. Then her son Prince Andrew became further embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. This year started on a grim note too when grandson Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle withdrew from royal le. When heir to the throne Prince Charles went down with Covid-, the Queen could have been forgiven for wondering when her family’s wretched fortunes would turn around. But it was the precise moment she turned her thoughts to the people of Britain. In an extraordinary address to an apprehensive nation, the Queen spoke with calm authority and soothing sincerity.  She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus. Invoking the Vera Lynn song, she said: “We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again.” The TV address was seen by  million people. A royal source tells the Sunday Mirror: “You only have to look at her speech to realise,it was ever in doubt, how much she means to the nation.”  Royal biographer Penny Junor adds: “When in times of crisis, the Queen speaks for us and expresses and calms our anxieties. “She will have been very worried about Charles when he got the virus. It can strike perfectly healthy people. One minute they have got it mildly and the next minute, they are rushed into intensive care.” Ms Junor spells out how well the Queen has handled her family’s recent troubles. Prince Philip crashed his car on the edge of the Sandringham estate, injuring three people, at the start of . Just  hours later the Duke of Edinburgh was criticised for not wearing his seatbelt or offering a swt apology.  Eventually the -year-old surrendered his licence. Ms Junor says: “It would have taken away his independence and been awful for him. There was worry about his wellbeing and about the other people in the car. Yet the Queen seems to have sailed through that.” Last autumn, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s favourite son, gave a “catastrophic” TV interview about his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The US tycoon killed himself while held in jail on sex trafficking charges. And this year, Prince Harry decided to leave the UK for a le in America with we Meghan and their son Archie.  A well-placed royal source reveals: “Privately the family were very, very worried about the tumultuous series of events, which really did threaten the very institution. “However, using a very select series of advisers, as well as Charles and grandson William, it was handled in-house without need for the tantrums others had been throwing.” Another source close to Buckingham Palace says: “The Duke of York is largely out of the picture and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are being handled by an American PR company who appear to be drip-feeding publicity stunts. The Queen is behind the real business. Using very few words to rightly heap praise on our NHS and the key workers keeping the country moving forward.” Her Majesty is no stranger to scandal and turmoil in The Firm, as Ms Junor recalls.  She says: “The year  was famously her annus horribilis. “Andrew Morton’s book about Diana came out, three of her four children’s marriages were falling apart. Princess Anne orced, Fergie and Andrew separated, Fergie was photographed topless having her toes sucked, then Windsor Castle caught fire. That was a pretty grim year.” A rare “public fallout” came when the Queen appeared to misjudge the nation’s mood after Princess Diana died in August . The monarch was criticised for initially choosing to stay at Balmoral with William and Harry. Ms Junor goes on: “I think the reason the nation was so lost when Diana died was because the Queen was up at Balmoral looking after her grandchildren, rather than looking after the nation. We take leadership from her. With the coronavirus, this is exactly what she has been doing, she has shown fortitude and given us all a feeling that we’re not alone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown exercise time should used","story":"NewsLockdown exercise time should be used to clean up litter, says animal loverRSPCA worker Julie Lyons has been ­spending an hour a day picking litter to save small mammals in the Staffordshire villages of Forsbrook and Dilhorne during coronavirus lockdownShareCommentsByKaren Rockett:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video chris-packham--ways-nature-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news lockdown-exercise-time-should-used-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Stephen, , drove from Liverpool to Pendle Hill to climb a steep hill and was forced tohome by officers who found him in Barley on April .But Stephen has hit back after the ordeal, saying he needs exercise due to his high blood pressure to keep him off medication, reports the Liverpool Echo. At the time, Ribble Valley Police said: Today we have removed an inidual who thought it was okay to drive from Liverpool to Barley to walk up Pendle Hill. His justication for this was his local hills were ‘closed to the public’ and he needs to exercise as he has high blood pressure. This man was ill-equipped for the task and clearly not physically fit enough to tackle what was in front of him. It was below freezing this morning and whilst it was a beautully clear day he had no idea of the route terrain or direction back to his car once he had got to the top. If he made it all. No map, no compass, no fluids and no idea...However, Stephen believes the implementation of the government’s coronavirus emergency powers towards him was inappropriate. Speaking to the ECHO , Stephen, a civil engineer, said he suffers from hypertension and has only recently come off medication for the condition.He said: An essential and ongoing combination of weight loss and regular exercise has resulted in my being able to manage my hypertension without the need for prescribed medication. However, the regular exercise concerned consists of regularly walking steep inclines as I cannot run or jog due to cartilage problems in my left knee.  Previously, Stephen said he was travelling to Moel Famau and Loggerheads Park in North Wales once or twice a week to perform such exercise. But due to recent Covid- restrictions, these sites have temporarily closed, which Stephen says meant he had to venture to Pendle Hill in Lancashire instead. At the start of his walk, Stephen says he was flagged down my a marked police vehicle, who enquired whether he had parked his car on the road. Stephen said: I turned to address the officer and was met with an exclamation of stay back, don’t come any closer. I was about ten feet away from the officer at this point, who remained in the vehicle. I confirmed that the car on the road was mine. The officer then askedI had driven from Liverpool.  I was having trouble hearing the officer, due to the noise of the vehicle engine, and endeavoured to take up a position at the side of the vehicle, whilst maintaining an appropriate distance, so I could hear him better but was met with another caustic exclamation of don’t come any closer, I won’t tell you again. Stephen says he then explained to the officer his medical condition and how upon research Pendle Hill had not been identied as a closed site for visitors. Following a further conversation, Stephen says was he was asked to leave the area immediately. Stephen says he was left saddened by what he believes to be aposinappropriate and completely disproportionateapos behaviour of the police. He said: It was never my intention to obstruct the officer in the execution of his duties in any way, nor fail to comply with the officer’s subsequent appraisal of the situation.  I was simply conversing with the officer in an attempt to explain the overarching circumstances and convey the fact that I had in fact travelled a ‘reasonable distance’ to the nearest available location able to facilitate my health requirements via appropriate exercise. He added: I am an experienced climber who was appropriately dressed and profoundly familiar with Pendle Hill. New government guidelines released to police yesterday state driving to the countryside and walking, when far more time is spent walking than driving is a reasonable excuse to leave the house for. A spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: We can confirm that we have received a complaint so it wouldn’t be appropriate to comment any further on this particular case at this time.

It comes after the Queen’s daughter spoke out recently in a magazine interview, saying that younger members of the family do not understand the work she has put in as a Royal over the last few decades. In a new column for the Daily Mail Jan Moir said Princess Anne has “a lot” she could teach Harry and Meghan, particularly about the choices they make in the public eye. Ms Moir said the Princess Royal has never attempted to “cash in on her status, push herself into the limelight, or overstay her welcome.” She added: “She has never tried to endear herself to the public or try to be something she is not.” Ms Moir’s remarks are in response to Princess Anne’s exclusive Vanity Fair article in which she revealed her own scepticism at how the new generation of the monarchy present themselves. Princess Anne told the publication: I donapost think this younger generation probably understands what I was doing in the past and itaposs often true, isnapost it  You donapost necessarily look at the previous generation and say, Oh, you did that apos Or, You went there  Nowadays, theyaposre much more looking for, Oh letaposs do it a new way.

Prince Philip has previous chosen to say such choice ditties as “You managed not to get eaten then ” in conversation with a British trekker in Papua New Guinea in  and, famously, “If you stay here much longer, you’ll get slitty eyes, which he said to a British student in China in . Charles, meanwhile, was more coy when he let slip a famously rude comment - but perhaps did not expect to be caught out by the latest in sound recording tech. It was back in , at a photo session in Klosters ski resort in the Swiss Alps, when the Prince of Wales was asked about his upcoming wedding to Camilla. The eager reporter was one Nicholas Witchell, a seasoned operator who since  had been the BBCaposs royal correspondent. In , Witchell had been the first reporter to announce the death of Princess Diana, Charlesapos first we.And in  his obituary of Princess Margaret - the Queenaposs sister - caused some offence at the Palace for references to her lovers and copious consumption of whisky.For whatever reason, on that cold day in the Swiss Alps, Charles, surrounded as he and his two sons William and Harry were by TV cameras, microphones and journalists, let slip his true feelings about the BBC man. Witchell had asked how Charles was feeling about his upcoming nuptials - William having just answered a similar question. Somewhat cheekily, the Prince of Wales replies: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway, before his face contorts into an awkward, somewhat exasperated grin. But then, through gritted teeth, Charles mutters under his breath: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is.  Whether or not he expected his comment to be picked up is open to debate, but thereaposs no doubting he could see the dozens of microphones honed on his every word. William, to his credit, remains composed despite his dadaposs muttered utterances and continues with a light-hearted response. As long as I donapost lose the rings. I have one responsibility and Iaposm bound to do something wrong, he jokes. William was to be a witness at the wedding the following week.The clip recently resurfaced on Channel aposs The Royals on Holiday programme.Ten years on from that day, Witchell and the Prince had an uncomfortable reunion.  The royal correspondent came face-to-face with the Prince of Wales at an environmental fundraiser in Washington DC in March . It was believed to be the first time the two had met since the heir to the throne was caught muttering his cutting aside. But the Prince seemed unrepentant when confronted by the reporter outside the event. He gave a curt reply when Witchell asked why he still cared so much about environmental issues.  Well, Iaposll turn it round the other way, responded Charles. I think youaposd be more surprisedI didnapost care about these things. But I think particularly in terms of what Iaposve been talking about now, thereaposs an awful lot to worry about. The Prince then quickly got into his car. Speaking in  about the incident, Witchell said: There has never been an apology, and why should there be  He was probably quite right. You know, awful man. You could take the view it was the best thing that happened to me, because it showed that it is our job as BBC journalists to report fairly and accurately, but not to seek approval. Weaposre not there to be liked.  Reports suggested that, back in , Charles had perhaps hoped the cameras would leave him and his sons alone for their weekaposs holiday while preparations for his wedding continued back home. Along with the comment about Witchell, Charles was also caught muttering, I hate doing this, and, Bloody people, as he smiled wryly. That day was also famous for an endearing interaction between Charles and his then-youthful sons. As the reporters bustled in their media huddle, Charles asked William and Harry: Do I put my arms around you   William replied: No, donapost, but you can take the horrible glasses away. Charles said: Do not be rude about my glasses, I couldnapost bear ityou were. A cheeky photographer then tells the Royal trio to look like you know each other, causing the princes to lean into their dad who puts his arms around his sons. Charles then said to his sons: What do we do   And William replied: Keep smiling, keep smiling. As the clip began circulating the globe - far more of a scoop than anything the hopeful hacks could have dreamed of bagging that day in the Alps - the Palace was quick to offer explanations to mitigate the impact. Pictures of Prince William sitting next to his then girlfriend and fellow St Andrews student Kate Middleton on a restaurant terrace the previous day had appeared in the press, and aides suggested the Prince was narked by this.

After just two years she decided to turn her back on the spotlight and along with husband Prince Harry stepped back from her duties. Many experts have tried to pinpoint the moment the couple decided enough was enough, but one believes there was one engagement in particular that was a real turning point. Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, thinks we saw a new side of the royal couple on the first day of their South Africa tour. Shortly before they left a township in Cape Town, the couple were stopped by a group of performers and started dancing with them, and the casual, fun moment became a tour highlight. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: She was dancing with the children and it was such a stark contrast to some of the events we had seen before her pregnancy. Sheaposs in this very affordable dress, sheaposs in affordable wedges, her hair is in a ponytail, sheaposs dancing with children. We didnapost know then what we know now but I think that moment and that look was a turning point in their roles, in that they werenapost going to be these high glamour royals any more. They wanted to be more down to earth, with the people, dancing with the children, getting out with the crowds.  Meghan wore a stunning black and white wrap dress by Mayamiko for a visit to a organisation that promotes female empowerment in Cape Town. The £ patterned dress was from Mayamiko, a sustainable Malawi brand. Christine said: I love that wrap dress because itaposs not a royal colour. Meghan does wear bright colours but her signature style and her personal style is more monotonatic - its black, itaposs white, itaposs grey, itaposs deep navy.  This was still her signature colour pallet - she looked so incredibly beautul, she was still showing a very normal post-postum body which so many women around the world appreciated and that outfit to me, especially as it marked the beginning of the tour, was a turning point with her relationship with her role as a duchess. Meghan and Harry shocked fans around the world when they announced their decision to step down in January.

The NHS is instructing people not to leave their homethey experience symptoms of Covid-, and highlights a high temperature and a new, continuous cough as the two main warning signs.Rather than visiting a GP, pharmacy or hospital for advice, itaposs urging people who require non-emergency help to use the online  coronavirus service for support. An expert has now told Health that having persistently bloodshot eyes could be a warning sign that someone has been infected.Bloodshot eyes could indicate conjunctivitis, which is caused by an infection or allergies.More research is needed to establish a link between coronavirus and conjunctivitis, a condition which can be caused by a number of factors, but one doctor has said the virus can affect the conjunctiva in the eyes.Conjunctivitis, also known as red or pink eye, usually affects both eyes and causes them to be bloodshot, burn or feel gritty, produce pus that sticks to lashes, itch and water. Dr Vicente Diaz, a Yale Medicine ophthalmologist, told Health: Many viral illnesses can affect the eye, typically causing a follicular type of conjunctivitis. We are learning that COVID- can affect the conjunctiva in a low percentage of people. The theory was backed up by a number of other studies citied by Health. The American Academy of Ophthalmology said that conjunctivitis aposmay be an uncommon but still present symptom of Covid-apos, and that it is import to remember that it can also be caused by allergies, which is aposmuch more likely to be the causeapos in the current season.

From being on the Titanic and trying to stop it sinking, to going for a walk with TV star Lorraine Kelly and her dog - our imaginations are running even more wild than usual as we catch  winks.Experts say itaposs because we are sleeping deeper and for longer, while some of us are suffering from anxiety about the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in. The Google search term “why am i having weird dreams lately” has quadrupled in the past week in the United States alone.People have also been sharing their #pandemicdreams on Twitter after being left either deeply distressed or just really baffled.In my dream, I called an Uber, but a hearse showed up instead. Not liking these #pandemicdreams, posted one Twitter user. A second added: I dreamed I was on the sinking Titanic and I was in charge of figuring out how to fill the leboats to capacity but maintain social distancing in the leboats, and everyone cared more about N masks than lejackets. While a third wrote: I was arguing with a guy in Tesco as he was standing in my spot at the till then I went for a walk with Lorraine Kelly and her dog Angus! Another mused: I dreamt Boris Johnson was feeding me ice cream off a spoon.  Some are finding that they are getting more rest than normal in lockdown, however around a third are reporting losing sleep and suffering restless nights. A study in France found that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a  per cent increase in dreams, with people reporting  per cent more negative ones than usual.Another study in Italy - one of the worst affected countries by Covid- - found that many were experiencing nightmares and parasomnias in line with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Sleep medicine expert Dr Meir Kryger said: This [pandemic] is something that theyaposve never experienced before.  And itaposs possible that their brains are trying to find a time when things werenapost like that.Itaposs like when sometimes people are trying to fall asleep and they canapost turn their minds off. They will try to think about a time when things were better. A dedicated Twitter account – @IDreamofCovid – has even been set up to collate peopleaposs dreams, as well as a Reddit thread. In the UK, sleep expert Professor Russell Foster said the majority of Brits are experiencing a spike in vivid dreams. Professor Foster, who is a director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, told the Sunday Times: Many of us now seem to be populating our dreams with images from the current crisis. Because we are sleeping longer and more deeply, we are having more vivid dreams and remembering them better. And Patrick McNamara, an expert in dreams, told National Geographic: “We normally use REM sleep and dreams to handle intense emotions, particularly negative emotions.Obviously, this pandemic is producing a lot of stress and anxiety.” So what do our most common dream means  A new study from online bed specialists, Bed SOS, which spoke to , people has revealed their top  most common dreams.It showed what percentage of the , had dreamt about:Having sexFallingBeing chasedTeeth falling out or crumblingBeing at workBeing lateFlyingMeeting a celebrityBeing cheated onDemons or monsters - nightmares  in  men also said they have dreamed about being pregnant. Dr Keith Hearne, a British psychologist who conducted the world’s first sleep-lab research into lucid dreams, said: “Dreams, especially those that wake you suddenly, are probably best understood - not literally - but as symbolic messages, and verbal puns, from your wise unconscious. The emotion left on waking is probably the best indicator of whether the dream portrayed something good or bad.” He also explained the deeper meanings behind common dreams... Dreams about sex It is not unusual for human beings to be attracted to each other. In the generally friendly long-term situation of a work-place, little fantasies and flirtations often occur. Freud would have said that a part of our personality which seeks basic gratication, would be responsible. In dreams it is safe to happen and can remain unspoken. Dreams about falling This can cover several dferent scenarios, and often seems to come up as a linguistic pun. The word ‘fall’ is used in several contexts in everyday le. It may appear either as a wish , or refer to a negative event . Recall what was happening in the dream, and the characters present, to uncover the probable topic. Dreams about teeth falling out or crumbling Apart from direct warnings from the unconscious of poor dental care, this dream may be interpreted as a warning that time is passing, and important things need to be done in le, or that you are embarrassed over something insensitive you’ve said to someone . Dreams about being at work Most reported dreams are about ordinary daily situations, so in the two hours or so of dreaming each night it is not surprising to find yourself at work – especiallyyou actually enjoy your job – or carry work-stress home. Dreams about being late This is a common term in waking le for missing an opportunity. In dreams it can be visually and dramatically displayed. Perhaps your unconscious is chiding you for your laziness. Dreams about flyingThis is a well-known metaphor for doing well in le and progressing with ease. Such a positive theme can ‘make your day’ and be encouraging for even more success.Dream about being cheated on by your partner Sometimes such a dream is indicating to the dreamer that cheating is indeed happening. The subconscious is sensitive to subtle clues that go unnoticed consciously, and the dream is just about the only channel of the communication to consciousness. But equally, a person who is lacking in trust may project that issue into their relationship. If the dream occurs in each relationship, the cause is more likely to be the latter.  Dream about demons or monstersThese are feared by most people, but in fact they present a wonderful portal for experiencing ‘lucid’ dreams. Nightmares usually have the same sequence of events. At some point in the dream, the thought occurs ‘Oh, here’s the nightmare’ - which unfortunately has the effect of releasing the full nightmare. You can however convert it into a lucid dream, using the main ‘law’ of all dreaming - that what you think, you will then dream. The technique is to change the mind set from ‘Oh, no! - here’s the nightmare’ to ‘Great, wonderful, here’s the nightmare. That means I’m dreaming, and I can control my dreams.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Kathrine Polak, a FOUR PAWS veterinarian, says that the shocking practice of eating dogs and cats carries the risk of new illnesses spreading. The unsanitary conditions associated with the cat and dog meat trade, coupled with the contamination risks of having so many dferent animal species caged and killed alongside one another, present the perfect breeding ground for new and deadly diseases, like COVID-, she said. The charity is urging governments to shut down cruel live animal markets, which it describes as ticking time bombs. It says that Phnom Penh, Cambodiaaposs capital, has a shocking  restaurants which serve up dog meat, which has been linked to cases of cholera, trichinella and rabies. But one seller says that in her community, it is believed that eating dogs can prevent colds and viral illnesses. It is claimed that doctors have been encouraging people that it is safe to eat as it is natural, without chemicals. Although Vietnam has a tradition of eating dog meat, Micheal Chour, founder of charity the Sound of Animals, says that the recent rise is also down to Chinese influence.  There was a big increase in the number of Chinese workers coming to the country and they have bought many of their practices along with them, he told the Sun. Many of those, such as torture, have been introduced here and people believe that because China is a big and powerful country, that we should be listening to these practices. Vietnam currently has has  cases of coronavirus while Cambodia has . Neither country has recorded any deaths from the flu-like virus. Wet markets where live animals are sold, slaughtered and skinned, as customers browse the stalls, have reopened across China. The Wuhan wet market, has been widely blamed as the source of the virus, which has killed thousands of people across the world.

Lionel Vytialingam was buying food when he heard car horns and saw a small terried dog weaving in and out of traffic in Ipoh, Malaysia.

Lionel saw the dog had a soggy note attached to its collar with a rubber band, but didnapost try to retrieve it until he had gained its trust. After about  minutes, the dog plucked up the courage to approach him and Lionel carefully removed the note, while holding on to her apossticky knots of furapos, hoping it contained the owneraposs contact details or an address.

His previously adopted dog Sammo didnapost get along with Siggy, so Lionelaposs brother is taking care of him while Lionel and Siggy stay in temporary accomodation. Lionel said: She had formed the most intense, most pleading eye contact with me from under her matted fringe. I unhooked the note, opened it up and read it right there crouched by the roadside.

The worried -year-old woman went to a hospital and asked to be tested for the new strain of coronavirus after one of her relatives caught the flu-like bug and died.Her CT scan revealed patches look like frosted glass - or fluid in the spaces in the lungs - which are commonly found in X-rays of patients with severe cases. By analysing scans from patients around the world, doctors have been able to identy specic abnormalities caused by Covid- and the patterns are similar to those found in victims of the SARS and MERS outbreaks. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror.  In the -year-oldaposs case, she presented to an imaging department in Iran after the death of a relative, ABC News reported.Normally, a person would not be given a chest scan in such as scenario, but doctors made an exception in her case. They found ground glass opacity in her lungs, the markings of Covid- pneumonia. She was being treated for the highly contagious virus in hospital two days later.Radiologists are now sharing the womanaposs CT scan - and the X-rays of hundreds of other patients - to better understand the typical signs of the virus and understand the damage that it can do to the lungs. Tehran-based radiologist Dr Bahman Rasuli shared the -year-old womanaposs scan with the Australian website Radiopaedia.org. He told ABC News: She insisted on taking a CT scan because she was very worried. Maybe this case in Australia would not have taken a CT scan, despite her insisting, but the physician saw her worry about the person who died and we just did the CT scan to relieve her mind.  Paediatric radiologist Jeremy Jones, of the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, said staff have discovered coronavirus cases while scanning patients for other reasons. He added: We had a couple of cases where [patients] had presented with abdominal pain and they got a CT scan of their tummy, but actually, we saw at the bottom of their lungs they had the [signs] of Covid. Experts have been sharing and analysing scans since the first cases emerged in China late last year. Their findings could lead to a quicker diagnosis and help to prevent infections.  In one case, a -year-old man, who worked at the Wuhan seafood market where the virus was thought to have originated, went to a hospital after suffering a high fever and cough for almost two weeks on December  last year. A chest CT scan showed similar patches and scans taken later showed how the opacities had spread. The man was diagnosed with severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, but he died a week later. CT scans of a -year-old woman who tested positive after visiting Wuhan - where the outbreak started - showed white patches in her lungs.The abnormalities were more pronounced in later scans as her condition worsened. The woman was admitted to hospital after having a fever for a week, a cough, fatigue and chest congestion. She was diagnosed with severe Covid- pneumonia and treated with oxygen and antibiotics. A -year-old woman from Sichuan Province in China was diagnosed after ing from Japan and developing a fever, cough and chest pain.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

during coronavirus lockdown","story":"Thousands of Dundee’s Muslims are preparing for a Ramadan like no other,  as they will be unable to mark the festival with each other due to the lockdown.The month of fasting and prayer begins on Thursday, and normally would be marked with large gatherings in the mosque, as well as community meals.But this year, Ramadan will be completely dferent, as places of worship are closed and social distancing measures are likely to be in place for weeks to come.Iman Hamza from Dundee Central Mosque said the community needs to focus on the positives of spending Ramadan in isolation.He said: “It is going to be quite dferent.“The mosque plays a central role when it comes to Ramadan – we have an environment of praying together and having community tarsto break the fast together.“It will be painful not to be able to come to the mosque – children look forward to coming and the elderly enjoy the social aspect of it too.”He continued: “We have to make the most of this Ramadan.“Fasting can be dficult, but with people now mostly working from home or on furlough, this is a chance to calm things down and relax.“Fasting can be challenging and exhaustingyou are working at the same time.“Maybe people can explore some other aspects of Ramadan, like charity and caring for others.“Traditionally the last  days are supposed to be spent in isolation to focus on ourselves – Mohammed and Moses received revelations when in solitude.“In a way this Ramadan will have  days of isolation.”Adult muslims observing the month will fast from sunrise to sunset # pregnant women do not have to go without food due to its potential impact on them and their unborn child.Meanwhile Abi Abubaker, director of Al Maktoum Mosque in Dundee, said people must continue to follow the lockdown rules during Ramadan.He said: “The mosque has been closed since mid-March after we took government advice, and it looks like the lockdown will be extended so we don’t envisage the mosque being open any time soon, perhaps not even during Ramadan.“Therefore, we are planning for everyone to pray at home.“It will be very dficult because Ramadan is a time when everyone gets together, and it can be crowded with families and children.“But this year we cannot take the risk of people spreading the virus.“I can’t remember anything like this happening in my letime where people are not able to go to the mosque.“There is to be no socialising this year and people are encouraged to resist the temptation to visit their family and friends.”He added: “One of the main parts of Ramadan is the tar where we provide food for those fasting at our mosque.“People find comfort in sharing that with the whole community, but unfortunately that won’t happen this year.“However we are planning to help those in need by delivering food parcels.“It is a struggle but we want it to go back to normal.”Ramadan will run from Thursday, April  until Saturday, May .Meanwhile, chapels and kirks are also closed, with many churches holding online services for their

answers from john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their

funding","story":"The co-leader of Aberdeen City Council has called for local authorities to receive their fair share of funding allocated to aid the fight against coronavirus.The UK Government has so far distributed an additional £ million to Scotland as the country continues to feel the effects of the global outbreak.But councillor Douglas Lumsden warned of the unexpected financial challenges faced by Aberdeen because of the pandemic.He has written to the Scottish Government’s local government minister Kevin Stewart – also the MSP for Aberdeen Central – to ensure councils across the country receive a large enough share to help them continue to battle the outbreak.Mr Lumsden said: “Aberdeen City Council has responded to the coronavirus pandemic extremely well.“However, the council’s finances and projections are going to be lower than was anticipated at the budget in March.“It is therefore imperative that the Scottish Government provides Aberdeen City Council and other councils with a fair share of the £m provided to them by the UK Government.”He added: “As the local government minister I have written to Kevin Stewart MSP as I expect him to be fighting local government’s corner, to ensure that he will do everything in his power to support our public services and back local government, so we can continue to provide vital public services in the future.”Mr Stewart said the money would be used to fund measures brought in to deal with coronavirus.And he insisted ministers would continue to demand more money from Westminster.He said: “The money from the coronavirus emergency response fund – due to Scotland as a consequence of UK Government spending where – has already been allocated to support a range of important measures in the fight against the pandemic, including additional funding for NHS staffing costs and to help charities deal with consequences of Covid-.“While we welcome the help provided to date, we will continue to strongly press the UK Government for urgent additional funding for the health service, local government and care sector to adequately deal with the scale of this crisis.”Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire West MSP Alexander Burnett said the additional cash would help ease the burden on the north-east’s public services.He said: “I am very pleased that on top of paying the bulk of wages for furloughed employees and supporting the self-employed and businesses, this UK money is going towards public services.“The UK Government have been clear that it will do whatever it takes to help all corners of the UK through the pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.53292240-2-240x180.jpg

We know how routine is important“They have three double sessions in a week and they have a combined seven sessions with the weekend off.“Each player can see what other player is doing so it becomes quite competitive as well.“We can see it as it is happening and at what level.“So we know they are sticking to the work that is given to them.”Aberdeen optioned not to furlough playing staff, although many Scottish clubs have gone down that route.Instead the players opted to take a deferral of wages and bonuses of between % and % from April  for four months.That decision was made because McInnes and the board believe the players need to be readythe season does start up again.Players are also involved in interacting with the supporters as part of the #StillStandingFree Community outreach initiative to cope with the coronavirus crisis.McInnes said: “At the minute we have an opportunity to keep on top of fitness with the players.“That is until we know when we are playing football, and hopefully that is not too long.“There is a lot of merit in keeping key members of the football staff and the players interacting.“That is the case for us at the minute, until we know exactly how the season is going to play out.“Obviously we are watching the news every day and things are looking pretty bleak.“But until we know for certain when we are expected to go back and perform then I think for now where there is still maybe a hope we can get back playing football in a couple of months.“But I do think we have to stay engaged with the players. We are still trying to keep on top of their fitness work.”If the Premiership season were to be cancelled before completion, McInnes insists the club would inevitably have to look at the possibility of furloughing players.He said: “If, and this would be a club decision, it looks like the football season is going to be pushed back then, and only then, would we really consider furloughing players.“For us to have no contact with the players and each other for two months – but we are not at that stage.“It is important we keep that dialogue going and players and ourselves all still have a role to play.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAt the Argyllshire Advertiser we take pride in impartiality, believing our readers have the gumption to work things out for themselves without us reporting matters in a biased way.In the past five years, the paper has spoken out on just two important issues.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs we have highlighted in the paper over the past few weeks, the response of the public in the coronavirus crisis has been superb.People generally have abided by government advice to stay at home.

We have three dogs and three cats in foster that were in place before the lockdown. We are trying to support them as much as possible.\"Unfortunately, the lockdown means that we cannot re-home any animals at this time. We had people lined up to come and meet two of the dogs on the week that the country went into lockdown and had to cancel their appointments due to this.\"Also, Pal, who has been waiting for over a year for a new home, was due to go away to his new home that week which has had to be put on hold. And we have no idea when he can finally go to his new home.\"And the centre isnt just coping with the stress of caring for the animals during a crisis, theyre also facing potential financial strain as the weeks progress.\"Our centre relies heavily on income generated from our four shops,\" added Lee-Ann. \"Seventy per cent of our annual income is generated via the shops so loss of income is a real concern.\"We have had to cancel fundraising events during the key fundraising period of spring summer. This includes our Annual Dog Show in May which is one our biggest fundraising events.\"We are hopeful that not all staff go down with virus at same time.\"We are managing the situation to the best of our ability and [despite] that our weekly income has reduced very signicantly, and we need people to donate to help keep our centre operational whilst our shops are closed.\"All our animals are still being looked after and cared for by our excellent and committed staff.\"Sonia Graham from Borders Greyhound Rescue added: \"Were trying to make the best of the situation.\"We have  dogs at the moment because we cant get dogs in or out. Its dficult.\"Weve had some under fostering, but unless they are greyhound people they wont be going to foster.\"Its frustrating because for people who want dogs, youd think this was the perfect time to have one as theres time for one-on-one training.\"And a lack of volunteers is a key factor in the dficulties facing the Greyhound Rescue now, with the charity normally taking in up to  regular helpers to care for  dogs.\"Without volunteers, its been a real struggle,\" said Sonia. \"Were family-run and we have a farm too, so were just trying to fill the gaps left by volunteers.\"Another problem which has reared its head for Sonia and her family is the knock-on effect of this lockdown.Sonia explained: \"People who may have lost jobs or their business, they wont be thinking of taking on an animal.\"People cant afford to pay vet bills. I can see this being a dficult year.\"If anything, we may see animals being handed in. People will misjudge and panic about the situation. And it wont just be dogs being brought to rescues but being dumped.\"It will be interesting to see how this all works out.\"And to help ease the strain on the rescue, Sonia has created an Amazon wishlist for donations to help keep the dogs fed.The wishlist gives donors the option to either donate physical items, such as a bag of food, or they can gt a cash amount straight into the Greyhound Rescues account to spent on vital products.On the other hand, the Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, in St Boswells, hasnt seen an increase in their four-legged residents, with the charity manager Shona Middlemass saying: \"Were managing fine\".She added: \"Weve not had an influx of animals, any strays that get raised with us we share over Facebook.\"Fingers crossed everything keeps going smoothly, weve not had any problems.\"We dont have any cash coming in. Cat and dog boarding is our main source of income.\"Wed normally have five or six dogs, And Easter last year we were full with ten cats boarding.\"We rely on people going on holiday, and weve now had cancellation right up to July.\"However, the rescue has received some good news recently.Border Terrier Teddy, who went to a foster home last month, has been dubbed a failed foster, as he is likely to be kept by his foster family, finding his forever home.And its not just your average pets who are being impacted by the pandemic.The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, which was due to reopen for the Spring season in mid-March, still has donkeys available for adoption and sponsorship, and is operating as business as usual.John from the Sanctuary said: \"We hope to continue routine hoof trimming, tetanus booster injections , worming and de-lousingas and when they are due on a welfare basis.\"All the rescues are doing their best to meet social-distancing guidelines while also ensuring the well-being of their animals.Borders Pet Rescues Lee-Ann added: \"Please do not come to the centre and only contact centre by phone or email and the staff will help you as much as they can.\"If members of the public have any donations for the centre or charity shops, then we ask that you please keep them until it is safe to deliver them.\"People can donate via our Facebook and web page.\"For more information on these four rescues, you can find them at: Borders Pet Rescue, www.borderspetrescue.org Scottish Borders Greyhound Rescue, www.greyhoundtrust.org.uk Arthurshiel Rescue Centre, facebook Arthurshiel-Rescue-Centre- and The Scottish Borders Donkey Sanctuary, donkeyheaven.org"},{"url":null,"title":"ex-radio-borders-dj-went-rome-become-priest","story":"A Galashiels priest-in-training has spoken to the Borderabout his time in the Vatican and what it was like being filmed by the BBC for a new documentary, which is being aired this weekend.Former Radio Borders DJ Bobby Taylor was in his fth year at The Scots College in Rome when filming for the BBCs Priest School began in September . He is now coming to the end of his sixth year.The -year-old, whose mother is Catholic, had always had the inclination to become a priest, even applying to train before, but for reasons-unknown never followed up on these applications.It wasnt untilgoing to confession in Melbourne in , not long after the passing of his father two years earlier, that he started seeing a path to priesthood laid out clearly in front of him ndash particularly thanks to guidance from his own parish-priest in Galashiels.When we spoke to Bobby, who is back in Galashiels, he told us: \"Since filming ended, the most visible thing thats changed is that when were in Rome now were wearing collars.

Theres only been two or three guys out of - whove left.\"Me, personally, my first year was probably my toughest year. It was a big adjustment from that freedom I had, and having gone from earning quite a healthy wage working at sea, then going to seminary in a foreign country ndash it was quite a challenge.\"There was a period where I did have to really, seriously, pray about it and think about what I was being called to do.\"I think everybody goes through it, and I think its a good thing that everybody goes through because ultimately thats what seminary is about.,params: .push\"Seven years isnt a number plucked out of mid-air, its a period where youre doing a lot of study but youre also doing a lot of work to understand what it is youre being called to do, andits being called to priesthood because its not a light undertaking, its quite a serious undertaking ndash but a good one, and a positive one.\"And the problems facing Bobby and his fellow seminarians have only grown since the COVID- lockdown.He added: \"From about six weeks ago being in Rome and studying in the university with my class of about  other guys, Im now sitting in a dining room in a Catholic church house in Galashiels studying on my own.\"So things have changed quite a bit. But study still continues, its not like theyve stopped. Theres been a couple of weeks, this week and last week, which would have been the Easter holidays anyway.\"Although we may be spread out, back to our home countries, were still persevering with study.\"And in June, Bobby hopes to sit his exams which will see him move into his seventh year at the Scots College.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

After all, there is still no reliable death toll, no UK or Scottish stats that include care home and community deaths as well as those that took place in hospital. Grieving relatives are left to tell their stories on social media, devastated that their loved-onersquos death doesnrsquot seem to count, distressed at the lack of knowledge or discussion around care home guidelines.There is still no honest or plausible explanation for why so few coronavirus tests are taking place, or why tracing ndash which has helped Germany and South Korea keep deaths down ndash was abandoned so early on. It cannot be unrelated that no minister or official dares to explain why the death toll in the UK is on course to surpass that of Italy and Spain, despite having had more time to prepare. People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable.

That the arrogance of this post-imperial country, with its delusions of Global Britain, led the UK elite to ignore the threat of Covid- until it was too late.Many Scottish nationalists feel much the same and say that Scotland has been harnessed to inept policies fashioned by a grossly incompetent Tory clique in Westminster.If only we could have closed the border with England, they sigh, looking at the way Jacinda Ardern has handled things in New Zealand, where the disease appears to have been stamped out by a total lockdown. At least for now.Reports that English firms had been declining requests from Scottish care homes for protective gear only confirm the suspicion that Scotland is a low priority, at the back of the queue, an afterthought.The SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil is by no means alone in believing that Scotland would be better ldquodealing with [our] own problems unfettered..[like]Norway, Ireland. Many MSPs are saying so privately, and wondering why Nicola Sturgeon is not distancing herself from the ldquolaissez faire approach of the English Tories.It was certainly possible that Scotland could have taken a dferent path to the rest of the UK. Smaller countries like Iceland and Singapore moved faster in locking down against Covid . Ireland closed the schools earlier than we did and seems to have been much better at suppressing the disease. Certainly the crude death rate has been around half the UKrsquos.But there is a problem: throughout this crisis there has been no signicant dference between Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach to coronavirus and that of the other three nations in the four-nation pandemic alliance. SNP MPs may say that the Scottish Government was press-ganged into backing the UK approach to handling Covid- and that her instinct was to go for a much tougher lock down earlier. However, there is no basis for thinking this.When Leo Varadkar made his dramatic announcement on March  closing the schools in Ireland, the First Ministerrsquos response was that this was unnecessary. She said she agreed with her own medical advisers that the disease would likely be spread just as readily by children at home, and that the emergency services would be undermined by parents having to stay at home to look after their kids.As for testing, this was actually stopped by the Scottish Government in mid March. As the National Clinical Director, Professor Jason Leitch, told Channel  on March , ldquocommunity testing and contact-tracing was halted after the containment phase. The First Minister was fully aware of this. On April , standing next to Ms Sturgeon, the then Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, said that testing was ldquoa distraction. This seemed to be a general view among UK medical advisers.Ms Sturgeon has said that she ldquofollowed the science. This has been the mantra used by ministers like the UK Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, since this outbreak began. Many commentators regard this as a convenient excuse for incompetence. ldquoWhy didnrsquot they listen to dferent scientists and the World Health Organisation who were advising countries to test, test, test But Britain has some of the best epidemiologists in the world sitting on the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies. The UK Chief Scientic Adviser, Professor Patrick Vallance, said again yesterday that ldquoI donrsquot think it is quite right that testing saves lives. Our medics still believe that tests should be confined to people who have symptoms and to essential workers. Mass testing will only make sense in their view when there is a reliable antibody test ndash and there isnrsquot one.Yet, testing and contact-tracing seems to have worked where, not just in South Korea, but in Germany where the death rate has been signicantly lower. Critics like Professor Devi Sridhar, Chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University, insist that the Scottish Government could and should have embarked on mass testing, though itrsquos not clear how it could have found the capacity so to do.She also claims that Mr Johnson and Ms Sturgeon adopted a ldquoherd immunity strategy because of ldquoBritish exceptionalism. Herd immunity has morphed into an ideological battle-ground, rather than an epidemiological truism.The problem for politicians like Ms Sturgeon is that they are expected to base their policy on ldquothe science, listen to the ldquoexperts, and make policy ldquoevidence based. But as soon as they do so, they are liable to be accused of listening to the wrong kind of scientists.Epidemiologists take a long view about the progress of a disease through its le-cycle involving several peaks and troughs. They have said from the start that since there is no vaccine,  per cent of us are going to get the disease anyway so there is no way of stopping it. That was one of the first remarks Ms Sturgeon made about Covid-.It is what the top UK advisers, like Professor Vallance meant when they were talking about herd immunity. In the absence of a vaccine, they believed that the only way the disease would die out would be when most of us were exposed to it. Prof Leitch was adamant on March  that : ldquothe alternative ndash closing the borders and locking everyone down ndash doesnrsquot work over a prolonged period.Thatrsquos as may be, but it now looks asthe politically savvy thing to have done was to ignore all this and go for a panic lockdown to show the voters that you are serious. In politics, doing something is always more appealing than not doing something.Scientists donrsquot have to answer to Twitter. The political cycle is not on the same trajectory as this disease, and politicians will get no credit for being right in a couple of yearsrsquo time.Shops across Scotland are closing.

I never normally give it a thought, but now Irsquoll be worrying what antisocial habits my trolley reveals.Doubtless the contents of most baskets would not cause an officer to pause for a nanosecond, unless they included a box of party invitations and enough barbecue coals to fuel a power station. But now the issue has been raised, it makes you re-evaluate every purchase.After rummaging through my wardrobe, I can probably get through to the end of the year without buying anything  other than plimsolls. By December I might be looking a little shabby, but thatrsquos hardly news. And, since mending and making do is enjoying a comeback, others will presumably be in much the same state.If nothing , this enforced stasis offers the space to reflect on how often what we buy is surplus to requirement. Compost bins and landfill must be groaning under the weight of food whose sell by date, like one of Douglas Adamsrsquos deadlines, whooshed by ages ago. Last week a neighbour discovered self-raising flour among her long-lost ingredients at the back of the cupboard and, after checking for weevils, enjoyed a baking spree with some equally ancient dried yeast. Going through his chest of drawers, my husband came upon a lovely unworn jumper of mine that is at least a decade old, but looks brand new. That I hadnrsquot noticed its absence speaks for itself.What previously felt like must-haves now simply suggest a reflex. The act of repeatedly reaching out and purchasing says more about a magpie urge to acquire than any critical shortage. This is not a puritanical call to give up the worldly or frivolous or, when the good times , to eschew the pleasures of things that, strictly speaking, we could get by without. Tens of thousands of businesses, artists and companies would be bankruptedwe adopted an ascetic lestyle that pared everything to the bone. In fact, when finally we unlock, we will actively need to help cash-strapped outfits and iniduals get back on their feet.As Europe takes its initial tentative steps towards easing restrictions, the notion of what is indispensable to daily existence moves beyond the hypothetical to something more profound. In some parts of Italy, bookshops, stationers and stores selling childrenrsquos and baby clothes are now being allowed to open, under strict conditions. In Austria, meanwhile, garden centres and hardware shops are back in business.These highly specic priorities are revealing of each nationrsquos personality. And while some would refute the idea that books or plants are anything other than accessories, Irsquod go to the barricades to defend both as central to survival. After sustenance and medication, we need a reason to exist beyond merely ticking over. The proleration of good bookshops in Italy shows its reverence for literature, a cultural bias that is confirmed by this decision. Perhaps the authorities recognise that, while enforced incarceration is likely to continue for some time, people must be allowed to feed their minds and imaginations as well as their stomachs.The same goes for gardening, which is a universal expression of the desire to nurture and grow. Such is the over-abundance of stock in garden centres and nurseries right now, getting the tills ringing makes economic sense as well as offering a glimmer of light at the end of the polytunnel.Shops across Scotland are closing.

A death begets a byelection. Crises, however grim, can be opportunities.So it was quite a surprise to see the SNP come over all prim and prissy this week about discussing independence in relation to the coronavirus.The prompt was Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw joining the dots between the two as he looked ahead to the  Holyrood election.ldquoI think it will look ridiculousthe first debate that the Nationalist movement want to have when we get to the other side of this is lsquoLetrsquos go gung ho for independence next yearrsquo, then more fool themthey do, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI think the public will look at that and say lsquoAre you kidding rsquoHe then twisted the dirk by observing Scotland was being helped through the outbreak by the UKrsquos ldquoeconomic resilience and strength.The SNPrsquos reaction to this was to try to shut down the debate entirely, a sure sign Mr Carlaw had drawn blood.ldquoThe last thing any Scottish politician on any side of the constitutional debate should be doing is trying to use the appalling crisis we all currently face as an argument for or against independence, the party gasped.Obviously, therersquos a calculation to be made about how far to venture into regular politics during the pandemic.The public has lost much of its appetite for the previous argy-bargy.But for the party of independence to echo Theresa May and say now is not the time to argue for its cause at all Well, that was a moment.Becauseever there was a time for the SNP to talk about independence - at least to itself - it is surely right now.Its previous case for leaving the UK, of a healthier economy creating a fairer society, is being dismantled by Covid-. Not speaking up would be a dereliction of the partyrsquos mission.The First Minister, as the tireless face of Scotlandrsquos response to the emergency, is an understandable exception. But for the Yes movementrsquos sake, she cannot be the rule.SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil had the right idea. He simply ignored the injunction from party HQ and tweeted that it was good Mr Carlaw brought up independence, as it let the SNP government mention it too and ldquohighlight that dealing with your own problems unfettered... is better.Regardless of whether you agree with his point, it made perfect sense for Mr MacNeil to make it, to keep saying what he believes in, and not cede the floor to his opponents.He could see Mr Carlaw wasnrsquot squeamish about a Unionist argument based on Covid-. That reference to the UKrsquos economic resilience and strength was a straw in the wind.Come the  election, the Tories, Labour and LibDems will be arguing that the Union, far from being an abstract anachronism, proved its worth in this crisis. That when it really mattered, Westminster broke the emergency glass at the Treasury and hosed the country with money. That the insurance policy paid out.: Mark Smith: A message for nationalists: do not make the virus about Scotland versus England ndash it demeans youPeople will of course argue over the many failings, about testing, PPE and the threadbare state of the NHS and the welfare state going into this.But the key message from the Unionist side, like it or loathe it, will be that the four-nations of the UK pulled together and got things done.And while there were regional tweaks, Scotland was a core part and beneficiary of that collective effort. Go ask its Nationalist First Minister.That argument is what the Yes movement, with its garlands of rosy hypotheticals, now has to overcome.It must rethink its own arguments - not its beliefs, but its messages to the unpersuaded - and it needs to get a sht on. Above all, it needs to say how a fledgling state can take off in the worst recession in a century.For what goes into the next white paper on independence now It was supposed to be rooted in Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission, the SNPrsquos economic blueprint for a new Scotland.Itrsquos not Mr Wilsonrsquos fault he didnrsquot factor in a pandemic. But it has made much of his work redundant.Its research on how small countries can prosper is salvageable. But his calculations for the first decade of independence - based on long-term growth of .%, halving a deficit of %, keeping debt below % of GDP - look like bygones of a dferent era.As the report said, persuading No voters about the economics of independence will need ldquoclear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.But as wersquove learned, no plan survives contact with coronavirus, and economic plans least of all.That particular pillar of the SNPrsquos case has now crumbled. The longer the crisis goes on, the more pages in the old prospectus will turn blank.The one thing that could yet change the dynamic is Brexit. If the UK government refuses to extend trade talks with the EU in light of coronavirus and brings about a hard lurch to WTO terms in the depths of a recession, it will squander any credit it is accumulating at present, and remind a lot of Scottish voters why they wanted to wave Westminster goodbye.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollHowever the current refusal to change course probably owes more to the absence of the only Tory who can sell an extension to Leave voters than dogmatism. Only once the Prime Minister s from convalescence can a pragmatic position prevail.Eventhe PM sticks to his original mad timetable, Ms Sturgeon cannot rely on it tipping the case for independence. She needs a new pitch as well.Her announcement yesterday of an economic recovery advisory group acknowledged that. Despite insisting she has no time for party politics right now, she said the new group would plan how to build a ldquofairer, greener and more equal society after Covid-, a clear nod to independence.It will be instructive to see how many politicians she sprinkles among the economists and business leaders to help steer it in that direction.God knows, she needs something to go right for her cause just now.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

I am determined to keep the pressure up on booking and protect my constituents.\":Coronavirus in Scotland: Ian Blackford calls for all Highland accommodation to close in bid to stop spread of COVID-All political parties have expressed concern over people attempting to escape cities and towns to rural and isolated parts of Scotland, in a bid to evade contracting the virus. But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this.

One comment posted below footage of a typically triumphant gig at the Barrowland says it all: ldquoNever been to any gig ever in my le like that, full of normal lads and lasses having the time of their le, passing gear to strangers like it was  and not one spot of aggro. Followed him everywhere ever since.This year should have been the one in which Gerry Cinnamon went from being the biggest musical star yoursquove never heard of to the one you never hear the end of. There was a high-profile US tour planned as well as a raft of UK festivals and arena shows, and last November he announced his biggest gig yet ndash Hampden Park, the home of Scottish football. All , tickets for the show on July  sold out in just four hours.Post-lockdown, everything has changed of course. The US tour has been postponed though at the time of writing the Hampden gig is still going ahead as planned. What definitely hasnrsquot been affected by the coronavirus pandemic is Cinnamonrsquos new album, The Bonny, the follow-up to  debut Erratic Cinematic, which topped the iTunes charts. The Bonny was released yesterday through his own Little Runaway Records. ldquoItrsquos probably not smart to release during a lockdown when the shops are closed and everyonersquos isolating, he said, ldquobut no chance Irsquom letting folk down.Opening track Canter is a well-established live favourite and two other tracks from it, Where Wersquore Going and Sun Queen, already have  million Spoty plays between them. Sun Queen also topped the vinyl singles chart on its release in October. Those wanting more than a stream of the new tunes were able to pre-order CD or vinyl copies ndash Cinnamon has spent his weeks in lockdown signing some at random ndash and for the true believer The Bonnyis available on flame-coloured vinyl, all delivered via Cinnamonrsquos website.Born Gerard Crosbie in Glasgow in October  and raised mostly in Castlemilk and mainly by his mother, Cinnamonrsquos stage name comes from The Cinnamons, the short-lived band he fronted in the late Noughties with friend and fellow Castlemilk boy Chris Marshall. By  he was performing on his own as Gerry Cinnamon at pro-independence events and had recorded Hope Over Fear, a rousing anthem for the movement. He gave up the series of jobs he had had since leaving school ndash among them scaffolder, joiner and chef ndash and honed his sound playing at Open Mic and Jam Nights at the Priory bar on Sauchiehall Street. Word of mouth seems to have done the rest. Although technically unsigned when he announced that he would play two nights at the Barrowland in , tickets sold out in hours. The same thing happened two years earlier when a Facebook post alerted fans to a date at the cityrsquos O Academy on Sauchiehall Street.Following that gig, Cinnamon gave a rare interview to Glasgow Liversquos Christopher McQuade.ldquoThe only reason Irsquom in this game is because itrsquos full of imposters ruining music and my very existence annoys them and it pleases me, he said then. ldquoIf yoursquore a working class musician hearing this or reading it and you respect the art of song-writing more than the art of pretending, then you have a responsibility to get involved. Therersquos a war on for real music andyoursquore sound and can write decent tunes then yoursquore on the front line whether you like it or not.The essence of his approach, he said, could be summed up as ldquoanti-marketing hellip thats what I call it. I try not to sell myself because it feels fake. Not for him the ldquosmoke and mirrors of  stories cooked up by publicists to make their artist appear more interesting. ldquoIf you try to pretend youre something youre not folk will see right through it andthey dont then what does that achieve .

Having listened to an accused recite his version of events, Irvine Smith leaned forward and told him: ldquoYou are a fecund liar.ldquoOh no Irsquom not, said the accused. ldquoIrsquom telling the f***ing truth!High dudgeonTHERE appears to be no bounds to the allergy your average Celtic fan has to anything remotely connected with Rangers.

Ten minutes later she was stopped by the polis and asked why, at pm, she was driving without lights. She replied: ldquoIrsquom almost out of petrol so I switched off the lights to save fuel.Thistle do nicelyWE recall the advert for a shortbread mould that read: ldquoOur eight-inch shortbread mould is expertly hand-carved in Scotland with a pineapple mot.

Both Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, and the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon were at pains to stress in their daily briefings that a precipitate easing of restrictions could endanger the progress that has been made, and waste the enormous sacrices that have already been made by so many.They were right, too, to resist calls for a timetable on possible changes. If, as all the UKrsquos governments have accepted thus far, policy is guided by the science, it would be foolhardy to assume that the worst is past until there are solid grounds for believing matters are under control.At best, we may have done enough to slow transmission, to buy time for the NHS to prepare, and to ready infrastructure to deal with this deadly disease. The questions that remain over the availability of PPE, or reliable testing, or other less urgent supply chains indicate we cannot yet be sure even of that.Unless and until a vaccine is developed and ready for distribution, every countryrsquos response to the coronavirus has been one of containment alone: the disease will not go away. A premature end to lockdown could make matters worse ndash and psychologically, it will be much harder to reintroduce necessary measures once they have been loosened.Butwe should not expect a firm timetable for the reopening of schools, factories or shops, we can at least enquire what the current thinking is on the criteria that will allow such decisions to be made. That mightinclude a combination of factors: confident assessment that the number of deaths each day is falling, widespread reliable testing to see who may have immunity, or certainty that capacity for treatment is not under the colossal strain that has existed to date. And it will not be ato the status quo ante it is much more likely to be limited opening of businesses or services with distancing enforced.To obtain accurate information on the disease and its toll, to assist the front-line staff and volunteers who have received less support than their tireless work deserves, and for reasons of basic humanity, we also need to focus much more on care homes and areas of the system other than intensive care. Badges showing support for carers are not a bad idea, but they are a token, not a comprehensive solution.Similarly, it is not to belittle the efforts of fundraisers such as Captain Tom Moore, to say that their hugely impressive contributions need to be lined up against the cost of this crisis. There will need to be a detailed description of how the economy can restructure unprecedented government subsidy is welcome, but must be effectively directed ndash particularly for the poorest, and for small to medium businesses, on whom recovery will depend. We should not underestimate the damage caused, nor forget that ultimately it will need to be paid for.All of this will depend upon clinical advice, and balancing the wider benefits and hazards of a continued isolation policy. We accept that the data may alter approaches or priorities, but it is reasonable to expect a general outline of the circumstances that may indicate whether ato ndashnot normality ndash a less strict regime is possible.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

No government has given reason to hope that the present lockdown will be eased, for any group, any time soon.We need young people to keep the economy going and I for one would be ready to continue to stay in lockdownI knew that parents could resume a more normal le and little children could access the locked play parks again.Can we not agree that those in good health, those who are tasked to build all our futures be allowed to have their lives less restricted  By all means ask them to be careful, maintain social distancing wherever possible and restrict access to older people. Or must everyone follow the diktats of those who probably have never lived in a high-rise tenement with children indoors for as much as  out of  hours a day  We are not all suffering equally, as usual it is the poorest, most vulnerable in society who suffer most in a crisis.Kay Gall, Edinburgh EH.SOMETIMES, when as a child I asked where was my father, I would be told that \"he is sitting with someone\", from which I knew he was with a person who was doing that strange-to-me thing, dying. As an elder in our Welsh chapel he had a certain way with him to comfort people. People, of all religious beliefs round our home area would say \"send for Elwyn\" and he would keep the \"night watch\". Then be at work the next day.When it was his time to die, he was at my home so my late husband, my mother and I were there for the weeks of his last illness. Even when he was dying my mother always shared their bed and he was never alone. The doctor and district-nurse were constant presences. His last day, as I was at work, I was phoned and broke the sound barrier to get home to be with him. I lay on his bed, held his hand and whispered. He always knew that I loved him, as he loved me. My splendid old dad.The last few paragraphs of the article by Professor Andrew Elderreally struck a chord. I can live with myself because I was at my fathers dying and he knew that we all loved him he was not alone. My daughters suicide,  years ago, meant she was totally alone, I could not be with her so the pain and grief are never-ending. Prof Elder is quite right when he says: \"We can find ways to allow families to be together at this time\". Surely that is possible Thelma Edwards, Kelso.I WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with Alan Simpson about the increasing number of people, with no medical qualications, claiming to have the right answer to the Covid- pandemic . I might add the increasingly annoying TV channel interviewers, who seem totally unable to listen to clear answers, given to their increasingly repetitive questions.As a retired GP, I am sure they will all soon perfect the use of an instrument which I found regularly to be  per cent successful: the retrospectoscope.Stuart Holms, Ayr.News from trusted and credible sources is essential at all times, but especially now as the coronavirus pandemic impacts on all aspects of our lives.

They include Brain of the Dead, Worst Case Scenario, and Genes of the Damned, in which you can discover who is most likely to become a zombie, contemplate the ethics of dealing with the infected, and decide how stem cells might be used to treat survivors.ldquoWe try to make people think about the consequences of an outbreak and about the ethics of decision-making, said Professor OrsquoDell,ldquoThese ethical questions are relevant today ndash do you quarantine a cruise ship with a few cases, exposing everyone on the ship to the disease so you keep whole cities safe from the virus  We also look at the stigma attached to the infected and the so-called super spreaders.ldquoAs the coronavirus spreads, itrsquos one of the few times that I have sympathy with politicians as they can only make the wrong decision ndash therersquos always a downside whatever they do.The lectures include apparently real CCTV recordings of a zombie outbreak at the University.

For example, we take a vote on whether you would kill a zombie or try to treat them and find a cure.ldquoWe are seeking further funding to go into schools and meanwhile our team of theoretical zombiologists is available to deliver science communication shows about biomedical science and the dangers of a zombie apocalypse at any event to anyone that will listen."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-vaccine-trials-finished-mid-august-says-expert","story":"Professor Sir John Bell, an advisor to the government on le sciences, said human testing began at Oxford University last Thursday.Asked about the possibility of a vaccine being produced by the autumn, Sir John told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe real question is will it have efficacy :Fidelma Cook: There will come reckoning for British politicians over coronavirusldquoWill it protect people, and that has not been tested and it will only be tested once you have vaccinated a signicant number of people and exposed them to the virus and counted how many people have got the virus in that population.ldquoSo, we wonrsquot even get a signal for that until May.ldquoButthings go on course and it does have efficacy, then I think it is reasonable to think that they would be able to complete their trial by mid-August.Sir John said a candidate vaccine was being tested at Oxford.ldquoThey have got a candidate vaccine, which I think went into man for the first time this week after a wide range of safety studies.ldquoIt went into man, I think, on Thursday.ldquoIt was the first test of testing it in a human being.He added: ldquoIfwe can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on.ldquoThen, of course, there is the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses.The comments came amid fears that some hospitals could run out of certain types of personal protective equipmentthis weekend.Chris Hopson, chairman of NHS Providers, said some trusts will run out of supplies on Saturday or Sunday because we have ldquoreached the point where national stock of fully fluid repellent gowns and coverallsexhausted.:Opinion: Tom Gordon: What is left of the prospectus for independence after Covid The comments came as a British Medical Associationsurvey of more than , doctors across the country said a signicant amount of them remain without the protection they need to guard against Covid-.It echoed another survey of , medical staff by the Royal College of Nursingwhich found half of nurses have felt pressure to work without appropriate protective equipment during the crisis.It comes after it was revealed that doctors and nurses in England will be asked to work without full- gowns and to reuse items when treating coronavirus patients ahead of expected shortages of protective garments, prompting outrage from unions.BMA council chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul said: ldquoThe Government says that one billion items will soon have been shipped, and while there have been signs of improvement, our research clearly shows that equipment is not reaching all doctors working on the frontline.ldquoToo many doctors and healthcare staff have already lost their lives.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain.

That is the eventual way out of this.#Professor Pennington, who has chaired E.coli outbreak inquiries and in , was awarded a CBE for services to microbiology, believed the system could then be recreated on a large scale in other health board areas of Scotland.#The islands have good medical facilities, but you would need to have good and effective testing facilities in place with a quick result. It would not cost a lot of money.“It would be an example for the rest of the country as long as there was an early warning system in place. It could then be possible for the Highlands and Grampian to follow.#Hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die. So we have to think of how we are going to get out of this.#Overall cases need to come down substantially — by about ten times — for the lockdown to be lted throughout the country. That is why we need test beds where levels are already low.#The virus has been spreading under the radar into places like care homes, presumably by workers who were unaware they were infected. The testing needs ramping up. The best you can say overall is that it is not now out of control, but we do not yet have control over it.#Professor Pennington, who has also been appointed by the Scottish Police Federation as a coronavirus advisor, warned that a vaccine will reduce the number of COVID- deaths, but will not offer complete protection or eradicate the virus.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds. This is the first critical step to determining how to save them and ensure theyto our coasts for years to come.”Find out more about the project at: rspb.org.uk projectpuffincopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

He probably had a measure of anxiety when he started to feel so unwell.Mr Montgomery phoned Liz and his two other sisters Anne and Helen before he was placed on the ventilator on the Saturday afternoon, telling them that it would probably be for a day or two.But our gut feeling was that it wouldn#t be a day or two. That was the last conversation we had with him, said Liz.That has been one of the hardest things, not being able to be with him.

He had a large circle of friends and could definitely be described as a people person. His quick wit and humour were enjoyed by his nieces and nephews who thought the world of him.Liz explained how a doctor had phoned her sister before he died and assured her staff would be with him.The doctors and nurses handled the situation so professionally and were exceptional in their care and treatment of David, she said.

When they die, it almost feels like a tiny part of your childhood goes, too.This week, I found out more about the woman who inspired me and the moments leading up to her death when I spoke to her children, Michael Mathers and Joanne Kirwin, who were still reeling from her passing last Thursday.Her daughter, Joanne, had a choice to make last week as her -year-old mother lay in South West Acute Hospital with Covid-: hear her distinctive voice on the telephone, possibly for the last time, or let her go on a mechanical ventilator without saying a word in the hope that each breathe she took would help rid her of the coronavirus.She chose the latter, dreaming that her formidable mother would overcome the cruel disease, so she could get back to doing what she loved most spending time with her family.Joanne#s brother, Michael, faced similar agony from his home in Glasgow as he liaised with hospital staff and relayed updates back to his sister in Manchester. Both have lived away from Fermanagh for years and last week, neither of them had ever felt as far away from home nor as helpless as the invisible killer prevented them from being by their mother#s bedside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old Ottilie FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old OttilieYvonne, a healthy mother, grandmother, sister, friend and a much-loved former teacher who inspired a generation of children, passed away while a member of the hospital#s medical team wearing a mask and a gown gently held her hand in the absence of her family. The word we keep using is shock. It#s very surreal for many reasons because in part we are in lockdown and so it doesn#t feel like it#s really happened. We#ve not gone through those rituals of mourning and that order of how you do things has not happened, Joanne told The Impartial Reporter.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator JoanneWe knew the coronavirus was coming we all heard about it, but without sounding arrogant about it, a lot of us thought it wouldn#t happen to us. It hasn#t really hit us yet, it feels like something you see on TV, she said.Joanne recalled the moment her mother was advised to go on a ventilator, explaining how she toyed with the idea of phoning her, having spent time exchanging text messages.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator. She was probably going to be quite breathless and I didn#t want to take that breath from her.Part of me thinks should I have, then the selfish part of me wants to remember her voice and when I last saw her and how happy and healthy she was, she said.Joanne smiles as she recalls her mother#s love for her children Matilda, five, and six-month-old Ottilie and their love for her.She always encouraged us, she always wanted the best for us. She always wanted me and Michael to be happy and be settled and not have to worry about us, she said.Yvonne had worked for the Western Education and Library Board Advisory Service and previously taught at Jones Memorial Primary School.She did take the teacher in her home, laughed Joanne.Michael and I had to remind her that #we are home now and are not your pupils#! She could be in teacher mode as most teachers tend to be, so there were overlaps with school and home le, she said.While Yvonne adored teaching, she told Joanne that her biggest joy was having grandchildren, joking that she liked being able to hand them back.She loved having grandchildren apart from the fact she said it made her feel old. She used to come over to Manchester, but it wasn#t to see me, the only reason was to see the girls! They brought her real joy, she said.With her mother now gone so too is a part of her, admits Joanne.I am  now, but I always had somewhere to go. She used to say no matter what age her children were, she was always our mum. But no matter what age you are, you#ve lost your mum, that place to go, that sense of safety that you don#t think you need when you#re .But when it#s gone, you#ve lost that, there is a hole, that driving force is no more. I will never forget the love and happiness she got from the girls and how happy she made them, as well as how happy they made her, she said.Mum was taking all the precautions MichaelScattered around Yvonne#s now-empty home at Ashbourne Manor - where last week, neighbours took to the street to hold a poignant vigil for her - are bottles of hand sanitiser, an indication of how seriously she was taking the pandemic. When her son, Michael, arrived at the weekend, having travelled back for her burial outside Portadown, where she was originally from, he found evidence of how worried his mother, who was prone to chest infections, was.Mum was taking all the precautions, he said, describing his shock.Even when she got the positive case, we thought, #Sure you#re strong enough to work through it#, and then when we got the call on Thursday of last week at .pm, the nurses were saying she seemed quite stable, then by half five, we got a call that she was not going to make it and by seven o#clock, she had passed away. That#s a microcosm of how I am feeling it is so up and down, he said.After feeling ill for more than a week, Yvonne had a choice of going into hospital and took it, believing that she was in the right place.Even in this period, she was still making smart decisions. She was very self-aware, she took it in her stride. She said, #That#s what I have got#, and spoke very positively of the nurses.The last I spoke to her on the Sunday night, she was getting tired she was advised to go on the ventilator and thought it was the right thing to do.She recognised what she needed to do, so all of her choices were the right ones at the right time, said Michael.His mother was hugely supportive, he says, particularly during dficult periods of his le.She told me, #You are always going to be my son#. She was very encouraging, but she was very direct when she needed to be, very black and white, no real nonsense.If she needed to tell you to pull your socks up, that#s what she did in a loving and caring way. She kept us all together and I couldn#t have asked for more throughout my le.Among the children she has inspired is Michael#s daughter, Ella, who is now eight-and-a-half.The biggest regret is that she is not here to see Ella, Matilda or Ottilie grow up and become women themselves. That#s the biggest challenge in the future, encountering birthdays and looking around the room and realising that she#s not there.She wasn#t just a mother, or a grandmother, or a friend. She was an important role model in many people#s lives, he said.This was true.I once got  out of  in my spellings and she asked me what I had for breakfast.Coco Pops, I replied. She laughed and told the rest of my class to eat Coco Pops.I remember telling mum we had to buy some, texted my old classmate, Roisin Francis, this week.It takes a big heart to shape little minds.Mrs Mathers had a huge heart and didn#t just teach, she touched all our lives.

There#s disappointment that my future has been taken out of my control and, for me and many of my friends, I know those final few yards can make all the dference in what grades we achieve, what university we will go to and what future is ahead for us all.I have been worried about whether I have done enough to get the grades I need, and I have four more months until August to sit and wait to see what my future is.I didn#t do as well in mocks as I would have liked to, but it was always in my head that these were a practice run, they were not the be-all and end-all of what my final grades would be.As students we were always told that the mocks were the big chance for us to find out where we needed to improve, fix all the mistakes we were making, so I was probably like so many more pupils in seeing them as a practice run.No longer going to school, I don#t have my friends there for support like I would have and there#s no final encouragement from teachers to prepare for the exams.Of course, there is relief that I won#t spend the next few weeks worrying about having to go and take the final exams.

Of those treating Covid- patients where, over a thirdsaid they were being asked to reuse.Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland, said: We all know that nursing staff have been under enormous pressure during this pandemic.However, it is shocking to find that nurses are feeling pressurised to work without the protection they need.The findings are from a survey conducted by the RCN to provide a snapshot of PPE shortages over the Easter weekend.Health chiefs here say they have secured millions of items from international and local suppliers.Ms Cullen added: This is an anxious and worrying time for staff, and they must have the reassurance that they can do their jobs with all of the equipment necessary.Time and time again we have been on record as saying this.It is very disappointing to find that there are still problems.Nurses carry out the majority of direct patient care and, while we acknowledge that these are extremely challenging times, we must resolve these issues. If we don#t, this will inevitably lead to further problems.The survey of local nursing staff said:Almost a quarter of nursing staff treating Covid- positive patients not on ventilators report an immediate lack of face and eye protection.Less than half of nursing staffbelieve they have enough alcohol hand rub.One in  nurses is relying on face or eye protection they have bought or homemade.Over half did not have access to either suitable changing facilitiesor washing showering facilities .Meanwhile, the NI Blood Transfusion Service came under fire from trade union Unison, which claimed front line staff in the vital service were concerned that they were not being given an adequate level of PPE to do their job safely during the Covid- pandemic.Unison#s Marianne Buick said: Staff working with blood donors feel they should have masks and visors to provide reassurance and protect both the public and the transfusion staff.What I want for our membership is that they are provided with the proper PPE to enable them to have confidence in doing their job. Not just for them, but also to reassure the blood donors who want to help the NHS during this crisis.Matt Gillespie of the NI Blood Transfusion service said that his organisation had been following World Health Organisation guidelines on PPE provision, but was moving to address the staff concerns.We will be meeting the union early next week to revise our risk assessment and see what measures we can put in place to alleviate the stress and fears that staff have, he said.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To this day, the  All-Ireland winning team remains Derrys flagship group. The foundations were dug long before Anthony Tohill plucked both throw-ins in the lashing rain of Newry, that started the ball rolling towards Sam. This week Michael McMullan delves deeper, back to where it all began. On that famous September Sunday in , Seamus Downey nipped between Mark OConnor and John Kerins before fisting Damian Cassidys cross-shot to set off an explosion of red and white on Hill  behind. It was the final shudder Derry needed to wade clear of the early Cork storm and en their strides towards Sam Maguire. googletag.cmd.push Every dream begins somewhere. The s was greeted with a raft of MacRory and Hogan Cups, following on from St Pius Vocational Schools glory. Added in was an Ulster U title and four All-Ireland minor final appearances – producing two wins. It was a golden era that helped assemble the crux of a team that would dine at the top table for most of a decade. Tradition emerges in cycles. The s saw Derry seniors regularly at Croke Park. They lost a NFL final to the Dubs, won three Ulster senior titles, losing a further two finals. It was a team that Mick ODwyer termed the greatest team never to win footballs top prize. Their example, inspired the generation coming after them. googletag.cmd.push But Derrys waves of success had already begun. St Columbs Derry won the MacRory and Hogan Cup in , the same year Tommy Diamond captained the Oaks minor crop to the Tom Markham Cup. An All-Ireland U followed three years later. It was natural progression. This success, needed inspiration to come from somewhere. Its about having an example to follow. They needed the earliest pioneers to put Derry football on the map. *** According to Derry GAAs history book, produced in , the first official county board meeting took place in September . All six clubs present have since dissolved, but of the  present at the start of , only Claudy and Foreglen exist to this day. St Patricks Waterside are credited by the Derry People with having the first team to represent the county, when they played Strabane in a game at Lford. After nine attempts to get the GAA fully operational, in a period that saw Derry win two Ulster hurling championships and reach four football finals, it wasnt here to stay until . Ulster Council official Benny Fay, of Cavan, organised an exhibition game between Newbridge and Ballinderry. After the game, the county board was formed of  officials, two from each club. In May that year, Derry beat Antrim in the opening round of the Ulster junior championship, before beating Tyrone in the semi-final, but they lost to Donegal in the decider. Later, in , they entered the league but were defeated by Tyrone in their first game. It was the start. In  a new city board emerged and their secretary, Sean Dolan, later presided over a meeting in Claudy to elect a North Derry board. By , the county had entered its first minor team which would supply seven players to the senior team who began the building process. It also contained future GAA President Paddy McFlynn. It wasnt until the s that titles began to regularly arrive. It was a spell when Derry won the Ulster junior championship, the now defunct Dr Lagan Cup , the Dr McKenna Cup and pride of place - the  NFL title.   NFL Champions From that team, goalkeeper Charlie Moran, Sonny McCann, John Eddie Mullan, Mickey McNaught and Roddy Gribbin would form the spine of a team that took Derry into the next decade. They reached the league semi-final of , only to be narrowly beaten by All-Ireland champions Meath. The same year, a strong junior team lost to Mayo in the All-Ireland final and three years later, the seniors pushed a star-studded Cavan team all the way in a league game. The momentum was building with every passing year. In , Derry beat Armagh in the Dr McKenna Cup, just nine months after the Orchard side had contested an All-Ireland final with Kerry. Twelve months later, in , a win over Armagh would see Derry contest their first Ulster senior final since . No longer was the top level of provincial football a one-game season, before being knocked out on their ear. Derry were beginning to challenge. In the decider, they came up against a Cavan team in search of their th title. Derry had seven of the team that would play in their first ever All-Ireland senior final four years later. They gave the Breffni men all they wanted before going down - to -. The winners had Peter ODonohue to thank for his display of accuracy from frees. Derry were getting closer and closer. The  season ended with another appearance in the final, this time going down to Tyrone by two points. Their time was just around the corner. *** The  season was the best in Derrys history, at the time, but it began in the unfamiliar surroundings under the Twin Towers of Wembley Stadium. The British GAA rented the iconic venue to host a tournament, known as Wembley at Whit. It became a hit and lasted until the s. Derry took the field before Galway, in front of an attendance of ,, making them the first ever GAA team to step on the hallowed Wembley turf. The Tribesmen lted Sam two years earlier and ran out eight point winners over a Derry team on the rise. The  season saw Derry win both the Dr McKenna and the Dr Lagan Cups. It was on the championship stage where they laid their greatest stamp. Derry opened with a narrow three-point win over neighbours Antrim at Casement Park. It was all the more signicant, as the Oakleafers had to come from behind in the closing stages. It set up a clash with Cavan in the semi-final, who took three games to get over Monaghan. Derry started sluggishly against the Ulster kingpins before pulling away to book their place in the final. It was a novel pairing with Derry and Down both vying for a first title. It was manager Roddy Gribbins side who came out on the right side of the battle in Clones . The Ulster champions were now poised for an All-Ireland semi-final clash with Kerry. Before that, Derry played the Dr McKenna Cup final in early August, something that would be unheard of now. They hammered Armagh - to -. *** It set Derry up for the biggest game in their history. After years challenging at All-Ireland junior level, this was the pinnacle. And it was Kerry standing in their way. In their ranks were newcomers Mick ODwyer at wing back and Mick OConnell in attack. On a tricky day for football, the Kingdom began with the first of two Tadhgie Lyne goals and led - to -. By half-time it was a dferent story and Derry were two points ahead. The Oakleafers matched a fancied Kerry side every step of the way and went into a four point lead before Lyne grabbed a second goal to leave them holding on in the final moments to book their place in the final on a - to - scoreline. It was time to challenge for Sam. Derry were a young side, but benefited from the experience and nous of manager Roddy Gribbin, who would come on later in the final, to bring down the curtain on a  year senior career. The Dubs were primed after losing the  final to Kerry and nine of the starting team were back, including Kevin Heffernan, Paddy Haughey and ace free-taker Ollie Freaney. Dublin had the wind at their backs and attacked the Hill  end in the first half. Haugheys control on the ground set up Heffo for a point to settle down the home side. It took an angled kick from Brendan Murray to get the Oaks off the mark. But back came Dublin and led - to - at one point in the first half, with Freaney and John Timmons doing much of the damage. Derry began to find their feet, but were wasteful in front of goal. Up popped Dinny McKeever to notch their second point, before two Sean OConnell points had his side within a goal of the Dubs. The interval lead was - to -. OConnell was on target early in the second half, but Derry needed a Patsy Gormley save to deny full-forward Johnny Joyce.  The build-up to Owen Gribbins goal Another OConnell free had Derry back to within the kick of a ball. Then they were level. Twenty-five years before Downeys fisted goal, Derry were again attacking the Railway goals. Owen Gribbin did the spadework earlier in the move. Chuck Higgins and Brian Mullan went close in a goalmouth scramble before Owen Gribbin finished to the net. The sides were level - to -. They needed a break to swing their control into something that would ask questions of Dublin. Their brief glimmer of hope was quashed when Des Ferguson goaled for Dublin shortly after. The changing of the game as the introduction of Maurice Whelan to the Dublin defence, allowing Lar Foley to push towards midfield where he negated the influence of Jim McKeever. A second Dublin goal pushed the margin to eight points, but OConnell and Owen Gribbin, with a fisted effort, rounded off the scoring, but Dublin were - to - wi nners. McKeevers performances in the All-Ireland series saw him awarded the first Texaco award for player of the year. Later in the season, Derry completed the treble of Ulster titles by seeing off Donegal in the final of the Dr Lagan Cup. It couldve been a perfect season, but instead it laid the foundations for the success that followed.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly. Log ontohttps:mipp.police.ukfrom your mobile, tablet, laptop or other device. We do not need to keep your mobile phone or device – we are only interested in downloading the videos or images of that night. Please tell us what you know. If you want to speak to me directly, let me know via the MIPP application, email me atjason.murphy@psni.pnn.police.ukor ring me via . “The community response has been incredible so far, but I know that other information and material is out there. On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that. Talk to us. Ease your conscience and help us resolve a small part of the nightmare that the McKee family live through every single day.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In response to the Covid- pandemic, food is being delivered every week to households in need across the city as a result of the link-up between Apex Housing Association and the charity Fareshare. The surplus food supplies, collected by Fareshare from local supermarkets including Tesco and Asda, are being delivered by Apex to four areasof the city – Ballyarnett, Foyleside, The Moor and Waterside. Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I thought lsquothis is itrsquo and I wasnrsquot coming out of here, so to speak to someone from home like David Moore, who knew some of my relatives, and to get that reassurance from him meant so much.ldquoHe came into to see me each day I was at the Mater and had to be suited in PPE every time he came. It was just horric.Mr Bell does not yet know where he picked up the virus, orhe passed it on to anyone . Thankfully, his fianceacutee, Bernie Henry, who shares a home with him, did not contract the virus as they were both committed to social distancing as soon as he felt unwell.He said: ldquoI work all over Northern Ireland in my job, meeting people face to face, so I could have picked it up anywhere, said Mr Bell.ldquoThe first thing I knew about it was when I came home from work on the Friday [nearly three weeks ago] feeling a bit faint and ice cold in my feet and hands. I started to have really bad headaches.ldquoTwo days later I rang the out of hours and was toldthe headaches didnrsquot get any better to go to Lagan Valley Hospital which I did. They told me go home and to self-isolate for  days which we did.Mr Bellrsquos headaches continued and after consulting his own GP he went to the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald where X-rays showed that his lungs were clear and he was sent home to continue his quarantine.Then, four days later, he called for paramedics again who prescribed him antibiotics but did not admit him to hospital.The day before he was admitted to the Mater Hospital ndash the gateway hospital for all suspected COVID patients ndash Mr Bell suffered an asthma attack and felt increasingly unable to breathe at home.His fianceacutee went on the NHS COVID app the next day to describe Mr Bellrsquos symptoms where it recorded a red warning and advised to ring .Mr Bell said: ldquoIf it wasnrsquot for that, God knows where I would have been today. It took it a week for it to really hit me but when it did, it was bad.He was treated initially with strong anti-biotics to open his airways and then with oxygen from a CPAP mask to get air into his lungs.Once medics believed that Mr Bell was on his way to recovery, he was transferred to the City Hospital.He said that he felt most vulnerable when he was in separate bay with five other patients with COVID-.ldquoItrsquos hard not to worry when you are in there as you see other people struggling, said Mr Bell.ldquoBecause of the pneumonia, it was a struggle to speak, for two days I couldnrsquot speak to anyone. Bernie was not allowed in to visit me so we would text. Once I told her how afraid I was and she rang the hospital and a doctor, who was a lovely guy, came in to speak to me and reassured me that the pneumonia had been stemmed.ldquoEveryone was so good, particularly Dr Suzy Guy and Dr Liggett, who first saw me at the Mater. You see these people on the television but little did I know that they would end up treating me please.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later. The school at that time only had  children mdash it now has  children registered with double classes in all year groups and the nursery.ldquoI was appointed acting principal and Irsquove been acting principal ever since, quips Mr Moore.ldquoThe highlights for me have been many. Itrsquos been a honour not only to see children develop and flourish, but also my staff. Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors. I have been truly blessed to have a staff who have had a collective desire to put children first.Mr Moore also paid tribute to the parents and s for their ldquodaily partnership with the staff and your personal support to me as principal for over two decades.He and his we, Lynne, who live in Saintfield, share five children together and he says retirement will bring him a chance for them both to travel ndash when the travel ban is lted ndash and for him to devote more time to his beloved sports mdash hersquos a major football and rugby fan.He has been approached to do some educational consultancy work when he is officially retired but is happy to limit that to just several days a week.Mr Moore added: ldquoI can honestly say that during my time at Academy I have never wished that I had been a school leader anywhere  or that I was employed in an alternative profession.ldquoI will definitely shed a tear or two when I go. They will get over me, of course, as nobody is irreplaceable, but I will certainly miss the children and staff. I will not miss the responsibility of the day to day running of the place, but Irsquom a social animal and I will really miss everyone..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 Legacy.jpg","title":"The legacy of John de Courcy  ","story":"THE story starts in  when the Norman soldier-adventurer, Sir John de Courcy, went north from Dublin, the headquarters of Norman power in Ireland, and arrived at Downpatrick on February .De Courcy was a man of great physical strength and size. He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

She is currently putting our exhausted son to bed. I step into the back garden to drink in the last drops of warm air before the nighttime chill descends.My thoughts turn, as they usually do around this time of the week, to what I will write about in my column.I sit there for some time, my mind barren.No sound, just colour in the garden \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I look around, trying to take the perspective outside of my own thoughts. There are colours in the garden - ochre, pale yellow, startling pink, and ying depths of green.I’m no gardener and I’m struck by how this cycle continues without any interference or direction from me. But, while some buds have sprouted already, others remain just a promise. Plants, like people, develop at their own pace.There is something even more erting than the wash of the leaves it is the sound. Or rather, the lack of it. The air is still tonight so there is no rustle from the tips of the trees. The birdsong has long since quietened.More, there is no low thunder of traffic from the nearby road, no distant rumble of a plane in the sky. There are no cries of children playing, no adults talking. There is no urgent rush of oil burners boiling.I have sat in the same spot on countless evenings before, but I’m not sure I’ve ever noticed this vacuum before. Is it always this way, or is this another manestation of our new condition The silence is, at the same time, both reassuring and disconcerting. I enjoy the peace, but still like to hear some activity, just to remind me that there is something  out there, on the other side of the garden fence. I crunch my feet on the loose stones, just to create a sound.I take a moment and consider the day just passed. I’m reluctantly forced to admit that it has been pleasant. I feel a certain guilt in this, knowing so much about how many are suffering at this time. But, undeniably, there is an degree of attraction in this slower pace of le.This was a family day. The three of us shared breakfast and dinner at the same table, played together, watched a film, went for a walk. I wore a sun hat. Our son talked a lot and we listened. Later, when my boy is dreaming, my we and I will watch something silly on TV. She will have a glass of wine while I munch crisps. There is nothing  to do.I have written a lot in previous weeks about the strain that lockdown has brought to me and others. While that is true, it is only honest to state that it is not the full picture. This adversity has also created a more profound appreciation and distinction of what is important in our lives, and what we can do without.I think about what I miss most of the old le. Being able to see extended family and friends, watching my son playing with those of his own age. Much beyond that now seems dispensable. My whole le has been lived aggrandising sport to appear more important than it should be. Now, I find, I don’t think much about it. The new reality has separated the substance from the garnish.I consider how a normal day off work, before the pandemic, would have looked. There would have been a panic to squeeze in many activities. We would have tried to take our son to a class or play date in the morning, fought our way around a supermarket or clothes shop, visited people, forced some small talk, perhaps gone out for dinner, all while I followed the progress of multiple sporting events on my phone and checked social media. It would have been typically frenzied.This frenzy is of mind as well as action. I can explain this best through a simple example. I enjoy drinking pure apple juice. Apple juice with other flavours added, I enjoy less. When I go to the shop I often set myself the task of buying the plain juice. Yet, more often than not, I get home to find I have bought apple juice flavoured with pear, elderflower or, worst of all, cucumber and mint.The problem is clear, it is a symptom of a cluttered mind. Forever anxious about the next thing that needs to be done, and the thing after that, and not focusing on what is in front of my eyes. Sometimes, it feels that I can only think with clarity when I write, it is the most effective way of finding a path through this troubled maze.It is hard to look past the current pandemic when the agony being suffered by many is absolute. As I said earlier, its claw is so long and pointed that I now feel a degree of guilt when I’m enjoying an experience that I know others cannot.But the crisis will pass and then some of the things that enrich and colour our lives will start up again. Perhaps we will be just as we were before, perhaps, because the trauma has the potential to improve us, we will be slightly altered. The upsurge in kindness and compassion which has become apparent throughout communities will hopefully prove more tenacious than the virus which spawned it.The air is cooler now and I’m surprised at how long I’ve been sitting in the same spot. It is harder to see the plants in the half-light but the night seems just as peaceful as what passed before. I enjoy it for a few more moments before I go back inside.One of the many effects of the lockdown has been to sharpen my senses towards what is around me. It has given me the chance to spend time with my we and son that I would otherwise have missed. Distractions have been removed as the regulations mean we have settled into a more sedate, purer set of habits.Tomorrow will be another family day. We have nothing in particular to do and nowhere that we need, or are allowed to go. It will be just the three of us in our home. I’m looking forward to it.When everything  is taken away, what is left is what is most important. And, as I constantly remind myself, it’s all that I really need.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with.

This includes the use of PPE and, in-line with other providers of care, including the NHS, we have amended our visiting rules at the hospice.ldquoWith regards PPE, unfortunately, our hospice and community nursing service have been facing the same issues as the NHS in terms of getting all the equipment they need. We are screening patients with a phone call before attending their homes and staff will wear the appropriate PPE equipment during every household visit. However, we can only do this when we have the right PPE equipment available and are grateful to have recently received support from our colleagues at the Cardf and the Vale University Health Board to gain access to some PPE through their supply, for which we give our thanks.ldquoHowever we are always in need of more supplies to continue to provide vital end of le care to people living with a terminal illness, especially at this dficult time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief.
