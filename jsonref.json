Unlike the Labour Party, we don\u0027t believe in just throwing money at a problem. \u0027And especially at a time when the global economy is slowing, it\u0027s important that we don\u0027t let our public finances get out of control. \u0027He played down expectations of a pre-Brexit spending spree and pledged to stick to the fiscal rules which have governed expenditure for much of the past decade.Fiscal rules are broad budget guidelines set by chancellors that restrict the amount the Government can borrow, with the aim of making fiscal policy more rigid and predictable. The current rule was set by Philip Hammond and aims for annual borrowing of less than 2 per cent of gross domestic product in 2020-21.Labour MP for Wakefield Mary Creagh however tweeted: \u0027Emergency budget announced for next Wednesday 4th September. \u0027An early general election to force through no deal Brexit will be fought by MPs from all parties.\u0027         Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Javid\u0027s decision to delay the speech a week was a sign #panic# was setting in in governemntShadow Chancellor John McDonnell criticised Mr Javid\u0027s decision to cancel a speech planned for last week at the last minute, claiming it was a sign that \u0027panic\u0027 was \u0027setting in inside Government\u0027. The decision to fast-track efforts to draw up public spending and investment plans was announced earlier this month - although the target date was given as just September, rather than \u0027early September\u0027.Mr Javid asked for a 12-month spending round instead of a longer-term exercise in a bid to \u0027clear the ground ahead of Brexit while delivering on people\u0027s priorities\u0027.The spending round will cover day-to-day department budgets for 202021, rather than a three-year period first mooted by the previous government, as the UK prepares to leave the EU on October 31.The Chancellor said the review would \u0027give Whitehall departments certainty over their budgets for next year, and will confirm our plans to fund the nation\u0027s priorities\u0027.\u0027The next 65 days will see a relentless focus across Whitehall on preparing to leave the EU,\u0027 he said.\u0027As the Prime Minister has said, the best outcome for us would be to leave with a deal - he spent much of last week speaking to his European counterparts to do just that.\u0027But to get that deal, we need to be prepared to leave with no-deal.

As Fran Lebowitz once said: “If you’re a New Yorker, and you run into another New Yorker in Times Square, it’s like running into someone at a gay bar in the 1970s – you make up excuses about why you’re there.”Now, this tourist-heavy hub in the center of midtown Manhattan is changing – it’s starting to see more art. Spanish artist Domingo Zapata has just finished painting the largest mural New York City has ever seen, hanging 300 feet high on the building at One Times Square. It took him three weeks to paint and will hang here for the next few months.“I thought, ‘Let’s bring something non-commercial to the most commercial part of the world’,” said Zapata. “It’s important for people to take a few minutes and enjoy it. It’s about dreams and how everything is possible. You might see yourself in it and it might make your day more beautiful.”Roughly 340,000 people, many of them tourists, plow through Times Square every day – roughly 50m visit annually – so, this isn’t exactly where one expects to find any artwork (besides the postcard landscapes, maybe, or the naked cowboy).“That’s why we brought it here, it was about time,” said Zapata. “Even advertisements were more artistic before, now everything is data. What happened to the natural attraction to things?”The artwork is essentially about gratitude. “Stop for a second, we’re going too fast with social media. What happened to slowing down and appreciating what’s with you, right now?” he asks. “You might enjoy it.”The mural is covering the LED screens at One Times Square, a 25-story skyscraper owned by Jamestown, which has enormous LED walls handled by the advertising firm, New Tradition. It’s where the New Years’ Eve ball has dropped every year since 1907. This is also where it costs an upward of $1m per year to advertise.Zapata previously did a series of video artworks last year at Times Square, before Jamestown approached him to do a bigger project. “They wanted me to paint a mural where the advertising would be, to do something different,” he said. “They thought I was the artist crazy enough to go up there.”And it did seem a little crazy, considering he had an unexpected hitch. “The first day we got stuck up on the rig for three hours at 200 feet high and lost power, a storm was coming and our power shut down,” said Zapata. “I asked myself, ‘Why am I doing this? What was I thinking?’”Zapata’s towering mural has hints of European modern art. It’s an expressionist romp through familiar symbols (guitars, like the ones Pablo Picasso painted), dapper men in suits (like that of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec) and broad-stroked flowers (like the ones by Henri Matisse).The mural stretches across 15-storys of the building, covering the west, east and south sides of One Times Square. It was created by a team of 25 people, including a handful of painting assistants. It’s not entirely painted however, some of the artwork is printed onto the vinyl.Crank up your neck to read phrases, like “Life is a dream” and “Everybody dies but not everybody lives.”“What I’m trying to say is, here is the most commercial, aggressively financial area in the planet, where people are go, go, go,” said Zapata. “You don’t pay attention to the fact that maybe you don’t need these big, huge dreams, but this combination of the little things and the details. Stop for a second and appreciate what you have. It will give you a big reward.”Before it was created, the largest mural in New York City was a 20,000 square foot painting in the West Village created by Argentinian artist Magda Love alongside local high school students.From a political video art piece by Alfredo Jaar in 1987, to the more recent video art at midnight series, Times Square billboards have seen their fair share of artwork. Recently, Studio 54 co-founder Ian Schrager took over an LED screen wrapped around the corner of 47th Street and Broadway to promote his new hotel with the Sila Sveta design studio to bring back “the sophisticated glitz and high romance” of Times Square in the 1940s.In the months after the artwork is taken down, Zapata’s vinyl mural will be cut into 6x6ft squares and donated to charities to support art education. Among them, he’ll donate to Pope Francis’ art education foundation, Scholas Occurrentes and Elevate, a New York organization that brings art to inner city schools.“Art is a great therapy to understand you can make your own place in the world, your own magical place,” said Zapata. “I am trying to help others see something positive.”Just as he painted a mural live during the Concert for Peace in Madrid this summer, Zapata is carrying on the same sort of vibe.“I like to send a message of positive energy, no?” says the artist. “I always say, a lot of painters make a statement of what is wrong in the world, I don’t know about politics or how to make the economy better, but I know how to make it more beautiful for people who know how to make it a better place.”“That’s my goal,” he says.“There’s a lot to be worried about we can’t change our world in one day, week or year, but generationally, we can little by little,” said Zapata. “Positive energy is good, but people are used to negativity. In the news, everything is a disaster but not everything is a disaster. There are beautiful things we don’t pay attention to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27a2f146a8075c63ee44d9c6a4cf5faf97d3cc2a/0_7_2301_1380/master/2301.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=910b982833dc533463bbc187fc8e81ce","title":"lost airtime bbc radio 4s search for prousts masterpiece","story":"The vast scope of À la Récherche du Temps Perdu was always going to make 10 hours seem too short – but there were highlights to savourLast week in the , I commended those of a bookish turn of mind to surrender themselves to the BBC’s 10-hour adaptation of Marcel Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, broadcast over the bank holiday weekend on Radio 4. I had reckoned without the cricket, but even so, long weekends are, well, pretty long. So did the series deliver on its promise to transport us, like the narrator himself, back to the riverside at Combray and the salons of Paris?One of the central issues that faced dramatist Timberlake Wertenbaker and director and producer Celia de Wolff was how to balance the unparalleled sense of longueur of Proust’s vast roman-fleuve and the recollection of dramatic, frequently fruity incident. It is easier – and perhaps especially so in the grammar of radio – to convey dinner-party repartee than moments of reflection, even when they are performed by the measured, deliberate Derek Jacobi. Thus the ear was drawn more naturally to, for example, Frances Barber’s conspiratorial Madame Verdurin as she gossiped and plotted and decided who was in or out of her social circle.Equally tricky to pull off is the layering of a man in old age summoning up the confusion of the adult behaviour he witnesses in childhood – in our narrator’s case, the social hierarchies embodied by the aristocratic Guermantes family and the unwisely married Swann, which he dimly apprehends but whose import and nuance he naturally misses. “Greedy for happiness,” he muses in later life, of his would-be friendship with the Duchesse de Guermantes (played here by Fenella Woolgar), “I asked nothing more from life in those moments than that it should consist always of a series of happy afternoons”.But life is not always anything, and nor can happy afternoons dispel the other lives that the child experiences, perhaps most notably, and strongly present in this adaptation, the anguish and fear he feels when he is separated from his mother, “his sad evenings and wakeful nights”.Childhood agonies give way to a broader sweep of desires and losses as Combray recedes and the seaside town of Balbec and boulevards of Paris arrive and when the cast of characters enlarges to include the narrator’s love objects, Gilberte (Emma Mackey) and Albertine (Hattie Morahan), Swann himself (Paterson Joseph) and the rakish, libidinous Baron de Charlus, played with gusto by Simon Russell Beale."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99634053d252047aa2b74981af2dc0eefe4b3e38/0_117_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c58672a80c8a7dc0df22494362bb88b2","title":"reading group which fun book should we read in september","story":"As the world grows more serious, we’re dedicating next month to reading that will entertain and amuse.

I’m not suggesting we hide from reality, but it might be useful to have something to offset the pain for a while. Think of it as a literary restorative.The form that tonic takes is entirely up to you. My first resources when it comes to fun books are always PG Wodehouse and Terry Pratchett and I’d be delighted to read either of them again. But we don’t have to choose something so explicitly humorous. There is plenty to be said for the warm glow that comes from reading a more quietly witty book such as Fup by Jim Dodge. Equally, we could go for something more noisily exuberant, such as Angela Carter’s Nights at the Circus, or something plain and beautiful, such as EL Carr’s A Month in the Country.Or we could lean the other way, into the caustic wit of an Elizabeth Taylor or the ghostly chill of a Shirley Jackson. Maybe your idea of fun is experiencing a gigantic Iain M Banks space opera or immersing yourself in the imagination of Ursula K Le Guin. Maybe it’s getting to the beating heart of a Zadie Smith or Michael Ondaatje novel. Perhaps it’s just the thrill of reading something as linguistically impressive as Virginia Woolf. This could even be an opportunity to revisit Dickens. (There are few greater pleasures in literature than the arrival on the scene of Betsey Trotwood, after all.)Or at least, that’s my opinion. But now it’s up to you. Any book that you regard as fun is fair game and nominating is easy. Just add the title in the comments below – if you can also provide reasons, so much the better.

When we have lacked real journalism, we have seen crimes like mortgage fraud go unnoticed and unpunished, leading to a devastating financial crisis that destroyed millions of Americans’ lives.Real journalism requires significant resources. One reason we do not have enough real journalism in America right now is because many outlets are being gutted by the same forces of greed that are pillaging our economy.At the same time, corporate conglomerates and hedge fund vultures have bought and consolidated beleaguered local newspapers and slashed their newsrooms – all while giving executives big payouts. Gannett’s proposed merger with Gatehouse Media, for instance, will consolidate hundreds of publications under one mega-corporation’s control and slash $300m worth of “synergies” – which is often corporate-speak for layoffs. Matt Pearce, a reporter for the Los Angeles Times, notes that “the new GannettGatehouse chief executive is getting $4.5m in bonuses and stock just for walking in the door.”The result of these trends has been the decimation of journalism. Over the past 15 years, more than 1,400 communities across the country have lost newspapers, which are the outlets local television, radio and digital news sites rely on for reporting. Since 2008, we have seen newsrooms lose 28,000 employees – and in the past year alone, 3,200 people in the media industry have been laid off. Today, for every working journalist, there are six people now working in public relations, often pushing a corporate line.At precisely the moment when we need more reporters covering the healthcare crisis, the climate emergency and economic inequality, we have television pundits paid tens of millions of dollars to pontificate about frivolous political gossip, as local news outlets are eviscerated.The negative effects are predictable: according to a working paper by researchers at Notre Dame and the University of Illinois, when newsrooms are hollowed out, overall costs to taxpayers rise, because there are fewer reporters scrutinizing government transactions. A study published by Spotlight on Poverty and Opportunity, a non-partisan forum, found that, despite millions of Americans struggling to survive, budget-strapped “newsrooms have not turned their attention to poverty”.To be sure, when we see the Miami Herald exposé on Jeffrey Epstein or the Charleston Gazette-Mail’s courageous reporting on the opioid crisis, we know that good reporters are still overcoming the odds and managing to produce essential journalism that scrutinizes power, exposes wrongdoing, and challenges the status quo. But we know that those success stories are too often the exception and not the norm.We also know that Donald Trump is making things far worse. He is a pathological liar who has spent his presidency trying to demonize journalists when they dare to debunk his lies. Worse, he has called the media the “enemy of the people” in a deliberate attempt to destroy the very idea of a free press.Trump’s authoritarian bullying of the media is totally unacceptable and it must be denounced and rejected. But let us be clear: that alone will not solve the journalism crisis. Moreover, a further expansion of oligarchic business models in the media industry could make matters worse.Today, after decades of consolidation and deregulation, just a small handful of companies control almost everything you watch, read and download. Given that reality, we should not want even more of the free press to be put under the control of a handful of corporations and “benevolent” billionaires who can use their media empires to punish their critics and shield themselves from scrutiny.After all, TV networks that rely on $4.5bn a year of pharmaceutical ads may be thrilled to sugarcoat our current dysfunctional healthcare system – but they will never provide a consistently fair hearing for something like Medicare for All, even though polls show that a majority of Americans support such a proposal.Corporate media organizations sponsored by fossil fuel industry ads may gladly provide a platform for guests who insist that our current oligarchic economy is just great, but as studies show, the same outlets often downplay or omit coverage of the climate crisis that those advertisers are helping create.And news outlets owned by Disney and Jeff Bezos may happily tout Disney films and Bezos’s plans for space exploration, but we cannot count on them to consistently and aggressively cover workers’ fight for better wages at Disney – or Bezos-controlled companies. In fact, in one instance, we saw that the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, tried to punish a reporter because he spoke out for better wages at the newspaper.We need to rebuild and protect a erse and truly independent press so that real journalists can do the critical jobs that they love, and that a functioning democracy requires.When I am president, my administration will put in place policies that will reform the media industry and better protect independent journalism at both the local and national levels.For example, we will reverse the Trump administration’s attempts to make corporate media mergers even more likely in the future. We are not going to rubber-stamp proposals like the new plan to merge CBS and Viacom into a $30bn colossus.I have long opposed media consolidation, and was one of only 16 members of the US House to oppose the disastrous 1996 Telecommunications Act, which accelerated consolidation. In my administration, we are going to institute an immediate moratorium on approving mergers of major media corporations until we can better understand the true effect these transactions have on our democracy.In the spirit of existing federal laws, we will start requiring major media corporations to disclose whether or not their corporate transactions and merger proposals will involve significant journalism layoffs.We will also require that, before any future mergers can take place, employees must be given the opportunity to purchase media outlets through employee stock-ownership plans – an innovative business model that was first pioneered in the newspaper industry.And we will prevent media-related merger and deregulation decisions at federal agencies that adversely affect people of color and women. As the not-for-profit watchdog group Free Press has noted, “Women and people of color are woefully underrepresented among broadcast-license holders.” The group points out that this is because when the Federal Communications Commission has approved mergers it has failed “to consider how such concentration affects ownership opportunities for women and people of color”.When our administration appoints new, progressive leadership at the FCC, we will reverse the Trump administration’s moves, which have gutted longstanding media ownership rules. What Trump has done allows cross-ownership of newspapers and television or radio stations he has also given the green light to owning multiple stations in the same market. The harm may be great: “In theory,” says Free Press, “these changes would allow a single broadcaster to own both your local newspaper and your top-two local broadcast stations, plus operate a handful of other stations through sharing agreements – turning your community into a one-newsroom town.”We will do the opposite: we will reinstate and strengthen media ownership rules, and we will limit the number of stations that large broadcasting corporations can own in each market and nationwide. We will also direct federal agencies to study the impact of consolidation in print, television and digital media to determine whether further antitrust action is necessary.Additionally, we will pass my Workplace Democracy Plan, which will boost media workers’ laudable efforts to form unions and collectively bargain with their employers. I have publicly supported journalists’ efforts to unionize. Unions not only fight for media workers’ wages and benefits, they can also better protect reporters from corporate policies that aim to prevent journalists from scrutinizing media owners and their advertisers.Finally, when it comes to Silicon Valley, I will appoint an attorney general as well as Federal Trade Commission officials who more stringently enforce antitrust laws against tech giants like Facebook and Google, to prevent them from using their enormous market power to cannibalize, bilk and defund news organizations. Their monopoly power has particularly harmed small, independent news outlets that do not have the corporate infrastructure to fight back.We must also explore new ways to empower media organizations to collectively bargain with these tech monopolies, and we should consider taxing targeted ads and using the revenue to fund not-for-profit civic-minded media. That will be part of an overall effort to substantially increase funding for programs that support public media’s news-gathering operations at the local level – in much the same way many other countries already fund independent public media.Our constitution’s first amendment explicitly protects the free press because the founders understood how important journalism is to a democracy. More than two centuries after the constitution was signed, we cannot sit by and allow corporations, billionaires, and demagogues to destroy the Fourth Estate, nor can we allow them to replace serious reporting with infotainment and propaganda.We must take action – and if we do, I know we can be successful. We can and will restore the media that Joseph Pulitzer and Walter Cronkite envisioned, and that America so desperately needs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad96c1cbc0a08c746325b5e67dc56103dfbcf951/10_20_5738_3443/master/5738.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f70e64b8eeb76331ef5dc4d72185fff1","title":"the guardian view on the menopause at work a healthy conversation","story":"Connected as it is with ageing, it is not surprising that the menopause has a bad reputation. Even for women who have generally found their periods to be a nuisance, the cessation of the monthly cycle of egg production often comes as a shock. As well as the psychological impact of what used to euphemistically be called “the change”, the menopause brings with it symptoms for which a lot of women find themselves alarmingly unprepared – as many readers told us when we invited them to share their stories.These symptoms include the heavy or irregular bleeding that often precedes the cessation of menstruation, hot flushes and night sweats, an increased risk of osteoporosis (brittle bones), disrupted sleep, anxiety, vaginal dryness and reduced sex drive. Given all this, and the fact that millions of women are going through the menopause at any one time (around 1 million women in the UK take hormone replacement therapy, although four in five do not medicate), it is remarkable the extent to which the taboo surrounding the menopause remains untouched. Even as other aspects of female reproductive health have become more widely discussed, the menopause has been stuck on the shelf.So the efforts of two MPs, Labour’s Carolyn Harris and Conservative Rachel Maclean, to bring forward legislation on menopause policies at work are very welcome. Provisions such as flexible working or sick leave for women with symptoms might sound like common sense. But for many women, the experience of the menopause at work is one of discomfort exacerbated by prejudice. Even those at the highest levels are not immune. Dorothy Byrne, head of news and current affairs at Channel 4, recounted last week how she was once sent home after a meeting in which her (male) manager thought she looked feverish.But the truth is that even doctors do not fully understand hot flushes, while HRT has never been free of controversy. Marketed in the 1970s as a way to combat the signs of ageing, it was later revealed to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Broadcaster Dame Jenni Murray, who was treated for breast cancer, was among those to speak out, and the numbers on HRT in the UK fell sharply. More recent guidelines state that, while women must be informed of the risks, the treatment should still be offered – with advocates pointing out that the cancer risk is minimal when compared with factors such as obesity.New concerns have been added to the old ones, with a shortage of HRT causing difficulties and an alternative treatment known as compounded bioidentical HRT, which is unregulated but widely available, under increased scrutiny following an unprecedented warning from experts. Legal entitlements for menopausal employees would provide reassurance to these women and others, while the menopause activist Meg Mathews is surely right that a storyline in one of the big TV soaps is overdue. Reflecting on her own menopause, the comedian Jennifer Saunders referred to “the indefinable something that you don’t have any more”. But the loss can also feel like a liberation – and would be a far more palatable prospect were women offered the support from employers, and society more broadly, that they deserve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec38d6053633dc164ad9dcefda7416450690c6c3/0_126_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e7e2ec7a5151b00103bf02d288b921","title":"tim bell margaret thatcher pr media","story":"Tim Bell was famously Margaret Thatcher’s favourite PR guru. It’s not hard to see why. He mixed a ridiculously easy and seductive charm with wit and free-market views. He operated at the height of the then critical nexus between global CEOs, top politicians and journalists. His death marks the end of a “golden” public relations era that ned almost half a century, and Bell was one of its leading lights – and his particular star always shone brightly – for good and bad.I know something about Bell because I worked for him for three years in the mid-1990s. It was an odd thing to do for someone who had worked in Gordon Brown’s office. I was in my late 20s, had a young family and little money, and I was intrigued to learn about my supposed enemy. Bell of course knew New Labour was coming. He hated having to prepare for it, but took me under his wing with genuine warmth nevertheless.The man, like most of us, was shot through with contradictions. On the surface it was all free-market, small-state nostrums, but the daily practice of running his company was a million miles from that. He treated everyone with care and compassion, to the ridiculous level of never sacking anyone, no matter how idle or useless they were. I refused the offer of private health insurance, only to be told by him that he’d just pay if me or my family were ever ill. He went to everyone’s leaving event and his door really was always open. I worked directly above his office and could never get past it without being called in to discuss the political events of the day, interspersed with endless cigarettes (his not mine) and calls from cabinet members and Fleet Street editors.His free-market morals found expression in his client base. He’d work for almost any dodgy dictator (though I wouldn’t). But he’d also take on clients who had views alien to his own. Through Bell I worked to help get Sweden into the EU – an institution he despised – and I cut my political teeth working with Alan Johnson, then head of the postal workers’ union, to stop Michael Heseltine privatising the Post Office. We won. Bell believed everyone had the right to representation – if, of course, you could afford his fees. To him, it was just business. He couldn’t believe I wouldn’t work for the fox-hunting lobby – didn’t they deserve representation too?This was, to say the least, a grey period in my life. It was the moment when New Labour became ascendant and, it seemed, the contradictions between labour and capital could be ignored – “the end of history”, the political economist Francis Fukuyama called the time, and so it felt. According to New Labour’s answer to Bell, Peter Mandelson (who learned much from Bell’s mastery of the media), there was nothing wrong with being “filthy rich”. Through Bell I learned how to make things happen. In the future I made sure I reserved these skills for things I really believed in.There is a bigger arc here, though, than just Bell’s life, as big as that was. He always argued that PR was “simply a truth well told”. But whose “truth”, and what happens when “well told” just becomes spin? I don’t think Bell cared – what mattered was influence and financial success. The practice of PR for him was to talk “your” side up and “their” side down. A zero-sum game. But as the pager gave way to the mobile and the fax to social media, truth stopped being what rich and powerful people said it was – not least through their well-paid advisers.That old world of command and control PR was being consigned to the same dustbin of history as command and control communism. In an increasingly networked society, truth is something we should be able to construct together transparently. New battle lines are now drawn: between those who would use nefarious means to manipulate and distort our information world and those with the democratic desire to exploit technical possibilities for the common good. A future that isn’t imposed on us but is negotiated by all of us.Bell was certain the free market and not the state was the answer to everything. And yet his empire was run like the nanny state, coddling everyone within it. He would quote Thatcher, in turn quoting John Wesley: “earn all you can, give all you can, save all you can”. Such entrepreneurialism mixed with altruism is not my guiding philosophy – but can we easily condemn those who espouse it?The world is complex. Tim Bell was a complex man. And today there are no simple truths to be told – just complex relationships and interests to be managed and negotiated. • Neal Lawson is director of the centre-left pressure group Compass"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6dfcca9d879b974c4c42738f490bd5c247014c03/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17caa3bd9c69114ed8f0e60998f5cc92","title":"leaked documents reveal tories dramatic plans for schools","story":"Exclusive: crackdown on behaviour coupled with more money for schools and teachersA raft of dramatic and controversial education measures including billions of pounds in new funding, a crackdown on student behaviour and a further wave of free schools are to be announced by the government within days, according to a confidential briefing paper seen by the .The briefing document, dated 22 August and marked “Official-Sensitive”, details policy proposals for schools in England designed to be rolled out over the coming weeks in an attempt to seize the initiative on education before a possible autumn election.While proposals including a £3.5bn funding announcement and plans to increase teachers’ basic pay may be broadly welcomed, there will be concern in some quarters over a package of disciplinary measures that include a renewed emphasis on exclusions and allowing teachers to use “reasonable force” to improve behaviour.The paper, which is under discussion between Gavin Williamson’s Department for Education (DfE) and No 10, is understood to have been inserted into the government “grid” of announcements, as families prepare for the new school year in England.The headline figures include £2.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including £800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). The details for an extra £800m for sixth form and further education colleges are still under discussion with the Treasury.The main proposals in the package include:Any additional funding is likely to be welcomed by school leaders, although many will want to wait until they see how much of the headline figure has been “reprioritised” from the DfE’s previous spending commitments.Aside from funding, the DfE paper includes a major focus on poor behaviour in schools, said to be driven by No 10’s view that recent polling has shown strong public support for policies taking a tougher line.The announcements will include explicit support for headteachers who use “reasonable force” in their efforts to improve discipline.“This government backs headteachers to improve behaviour and will support them to create safe and disciplined school environments,” the document states.“We will back heads to use powers to promote good behaviour including sanctions and rewards using reasonable force to search and confiscate items from pupils (including mobile phones) impose same-day detentions suspend and expel pupils ban mobile phones.”While the DfE expects members of the public will welcome “a harder narrative on discipline”, the document warns key stakeholders will be worried the policy could result in increased rates of permanent exclusion, which have in any case been climbing since 2012.The document notes police and crime commissioners “worry about rates of exclusion driving knife crime” and acknowledges concerns it will impact disproportionately on children from some ethnic minority backgrounds, in particular black Caribbean boys, and those with special educational needs (SEN).The success of the Michaela free school in GCSE results last week is likely to be used by ministers to promote its behaviour policies, while four “behaviour tsars” are to be named, including Charlie Taylor, the former head of a school for children with SEN and the current chair of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales.While recent coverage of school funding cuts has included widespread reporting about teaching assistants being axed and headteachers’ concerns about the detrimental impact on classrooms, the briefing paper reveals – on the contrary – that Downing Street and the Treasury are more concerned there may be too many TAs rather than too few.The Treasury “firmly” rejected a radical attempt to improve recruitment by making teacher training courses free for students. But it appears more enthusiastic about a scheme to reimburse trainee teachers for their student loans.A DfE spokesperson said: “We do not recognise these figures. The prime minister has made clear that we will increase minimum levels of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and make real terms increases to education funding. We will be announcing more details in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca898409b072595eca91a8cf5c793d26042e9c30/0_430_4299_2579/master/4299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f728fe0f3035672e66a18f1986890a1a","title":"near total ban imposed on sending wild african elephants to zoos","story":"Cites, the global wildlife trade regulator, approves ‘momentous’ decision after EU adds loophole The regulator of global wildlife trade has decided to impose a near-total ban on sending African elephants captured from the wild to zoos.After a heated debate at a meeting of parties to the convention on international trade in endangered species (Cites) in Geneva on Tuesday, the member countries approved a proposed text after a revision by the European Union included some exceptions to the ban.The decision met with strong opposition from Zimbabwe in particular, which along with Botswana is the main provider of wild African elephants to zoos outside the continent and tried in vain to block the vote.But with 87 in favour, 29 against and 25 abstaining, the vote for the amended text secured the two-thirds majority needed to pass.“This is a momentous Cites decision for Africa’s elephants,” said Audrey Delsink, the wildlife director of Humane Society International’s (HSI) Africa ision.The vote in plenary altered slightly a decision taken at the start of the 12-day conference prohibiting the transfer of all African elephants caught in the wild to so-called captive facilities.The decision only affects African elephants. Asian elephants already enjoy more protection against international trade.The initial Cites vote was to limit trade in live wild African elephants to conservation in their natural habitats, basically ending the practice of capturing elephants and sending them to zoos and entertainment venues around the world.The EU, which for technical reasons had been unable to cast its 28 votes during the first committee vote on 18 August, had hinted it might join the US and others in flatly opposing the text.This prompted outcry, with a number of public figures including Jane Goodall, Pamela Anderson and Brigitte Bardot sending a letter to the EU commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, asking that the EU back the ban.In the end, the EU drafted an amended text, adding a loophole saying the elephants should remain in their “natural and historical range in Africa, except in exceptional circumstances where … it is considered that a transfer to ex-situ locations will provide demonstrable in-situ conservation benefits for African elephants”.In such cases decisions should only be made in consultation with the Cites animals committee, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature elephant specialist group.The EU amendment also made clear that African elephants caught in the wild and already in zoos could be transferred to other facilities outside Africa.While elephants in western, central and eastern Africa have long been listed among the species in need of most protection under Cites, and thus banned from all trade, some trade has been permitted in southern Africa, where elephant populations are healthier.Zimbabwe, for instance, has captured and exported more than 100 baby elephants to Chinese zoos since 2012, according to the HSI."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ea3aa5972d8ce6093131d8ab03905419a8ec1b/0_237_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=665ead4ff711adaa0edca547f822b79d","title":"mitsubishi invests in uk company to bring off grid solar to asia","story":"Japanese conglomerate backs solar utility BBOXX to expand service in south Asia and AfricaA British energy firm lighting up homes in Africa with pay-as-you-go solar power has secured £40m to extend its reach to Asia with the help of Japan’s Mitsubishi.The conglomerate has taken a stake in off-grid solar company BBOXX through the start-up’s latest funding round, which will power the Africa-focused company deeper into Asia.The funds will also help BBOXX, which operates in Rwanda, Kenya, Togo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to break into new African markets, where an estimated one in three people live without reliable access to electricity.BBOXX is one of a growing number of energy companies to plug into the demand for energy across Africa and south Asia.The falling cost of solar technology and the strength of mobile banking across Africa have encouraged major investments from global energy companies including US giant General Electric and France’s EDF and Engie.Mansoor Hamayun, BBOXX’s chief executive and co-founder, said Mitsubishi’s “extensive reach” and “technological expertise” would help the company to supply more people living without access to modern utilities and services.BBOXX and its rivals use mobile money to charge customers a monthly fee for the use of mini solar panels and ultra-efficient lighting strips. The fixed-period contracts usually run for about two years, until the equipment is paid off.Customers can then choose to keep their existing kit and use the electricity for free, or upgrade their system to include more panels and extra appliances under a new contract.It operates about 270,000 solar systems, of which 200,000 are monitored remotely by software that uses machine learning to track customers’ energy use and payments. In time, BBOXX hopes to broaden its reach beyond energy to include gas, water, internet and loans.The company’s largest rival, Fenix International, supplies 500,000 homes and was snapped up by Engie in late 2017.Hamayun said: “We look forward to this next phase of growth that will help us to transform more lives, unlock potential and grow our already global footprint by opening up new markets, and develop our product range.”The funding round also included Bamboo Capital Partners, a Luxembourg-based impact investor DOEN Participaties, a Dutch impact investment fund and Canadian growth equity firm MacKinnon, Bennett \u0026amp Company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97ee6981b62107ef5ef56bc5efc51382040d3a05/0_29_1730_1038/master/1730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=36b2579eb77da8c303015836e02428c4","title":"new zealand bans swimming with bottlenose dolphins after numbers plunge","story":"Conservation research shows humans are ‘loving the dolphins too much’ in Bay of Islands regionThe New Zealand government has banned tourists from swimming with bottlenose dolphins in an attempt to save the struggling species.The ban on swimming with bottlenose dolphins applies to tour operators in the North Island’s Bay of Islands region, which is popular with tourists for its warm climate and golden beaches.

As the heat turns to cool, it can be a time to think about a new coat, to ponder the new-season woollen offering and whether you ought to invest in a new pair of boots.But new clothes come with a cost about which we can no longer claim ignorance – there is no avoiding the ways in which the fashion industry threatens the planet. Especially this month, as Extinction Rebellion gears up to disrupt the source of so many trends with protests planned for London fashion week.For Tennant, who first appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1993 and has stalked down catwalks for Chanel and Jean Paul Gautier during her career: “It’s going to take us a long time to change our habits, but I think that this is so obviously a step in the right direction,” she says over the phone from what sounds like a breezy Scotland.For her, the next generation – her daughter’s, for instance – will be able to change their shopping habits more easily. Iris already visits charity shops and it can’t hurt that she has a secondhand treasure trove that most other teens couldn’t even dream of, thanks to her mum. “It looks different on them when they’re wearing clothes I’ve had since the 90s,” says Tennant. “I’m so pleased I kept them and they’re having a second outing.”The charity shops near where she lives are great on cashmere jumpers, while her favourite secondhand garment is an emerald green Yves Saint Laurent shirt from the 70s that she bought in a vintage shop on holiday.With Second Hand September, Oxfam is hoping to make a dent. There is already something of a silver lining: the clothes that Oxfam saves from landfill every year weigh as much as the Eiffel Tower. For Tennant, it is a fun challenge for people to take on. Of course, as she puts it, “the fashion industry really is all about creating a desire that you didn’t even know you had”. This is about trying to counter that desire, or, at the very least, look to secondhand instead.To find out more about Oxfam’s Second Hand September campaign and pledge to buy second hand fashion for 30 days go to po.stSecondHandSeptember"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6298284385878bd5d65f0b9d918f406e64f3a28f/0_284_5832_3499/master/5832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071c5e0b84ad53a0ceafcad389f45f08","title":"bury and bolton two of englands oldest clubs face tuesday expulsion","story":"Collapse of 11th-hour rescue deal on Tuesday night puts club’s future in grave doubtA day that began with optimism ended in despair, disbelief and fury in Bury as one of England’s oldest football clubs was kicked out of the English Football League (EFL) after 125 years.The future of Bury FC was plunged into grave doubt after the 134-year-old club was expelled from the league at 11pm on Tuesday, hours after the collapse of an 11th-hour rescue dealThirteen miles away, the fate of Bolton Wanderers also looked increasingly perilous as the club was given 14 days to save its membership in a league it helped found in 1888. The process of closing down the club could begin as early as Wednesday.There was widespread shock and demands for reform of football governance when Bury’s dramatic expulsion was announced by the EFL, which described it as “undoubtedly one of the darkest days in the league’s recent history”.It is understood that the EFL rejected late pleas for Bury to be given a 24-hour extension to its deadline, up to 5pm on Wednesday, to thrash out a deal between the owner Steve Dale and two new potential bidders after a sale to the data company C\u0026ampN Sporting Risk fell through shortly before Tuesday’s deadline.Ivan Lewis, the independent MP for Bury South, said the expulsion was a “devastating blow to us all” and that securing the club’s future was “now a massively uphill struggle and to give people false hope would be unfair”.“On the other hand, we can’t afford to leave any stone unturned and the fight goes on,” he said.Lewis said Dale had agreed in principle to sell the club to a potential owner before 5pm but that the EFL refused to allow more time for a deal to be done: “That’s one of the issues we want to discuss with the league as a matter of great urgency … But all options remain open to us – the fans, the council, the MPs – and we’re not going to lie down and die.”Hundreds of volunteers gathered at Bury’s Gigg Lane stadium earlier in the day, scrubbing toilets and cleaning the stands in the hope the club would survive and play its delayed first game of the season on Saturday.Those hopes were dashed when the English Football League announced shortly before 5pm that the late takeover deal had collapsed, as crowds of anxious fans, some in tears, gathered outside the ground.The fate of Bury and Bolton, two of the oldest clubs in English football, has fuelled calls for a complete overhaul of the rules and regulations governing the sport in Britain.Outside Gigg Lane, Clive Roberts, 73, said he had travelled 7,000 miles from his home in Canada hoping to watch his beloved club’s first few games of the season “only to find I was attending a wake”.Roberts said his great grandfather watched Bury win the FA Cup in 1903, while his own father played for the RAF team at Gigg Lane during the second world war. “I hoped my own grandchildren would be coming here in years to come – that’s not going to be the case,” he said.“The family will lose that link to Bury and lose what the history of the area means. It’s a very emotional day – I’m trying to hold it in. It maybe hasn’t hit home yet but it will.”Greg Edyvean, 38, has had a season ticket at Gigg Lane since he was six weeks old. He continued the tradition with his own two children, now aged 12 and two.As the news of the deal’s collapse filtered through, Edyvean was allowed to sit alone in his regular seat inside the stadium. “I’ve been sat there for the best part of two hours in tears,” he said. “It’s my favourite place on earth and it could be the last time it happens. It’s horrific. There’s not words to describe it.”Some volunteers drove 300 miles to take part in the clean-up operation, with plumbers, bricklayers, electricians all chipping in alongside fans of rival clubs including Leeds United, Accrington Stanley and Blackpool.Carrying her gloves, bucket and sponge, 72-year-old Joan Lingard was cleaning the stadium’s seats by 9am on Tuesday. It would be “absolutely awful” for Bury if its club disappeared, she said. “Everybody’s come down, whether they come to the matches or not. I’d hate to see it go. Next to Bury black puddings, this is the next thing, Gigg Lane. The two are synonymous.”Ian Frazer, 48, a Leeds fan, joined the clean-up, motivated by the financial crisis experienced by his own club 12 years ago. Wearing a Leeds shirt while scrubbing pigeon droppings off Bury’s Manchester Road stand, Frazer said: “It’s simple stuff like this that’s fantastic to see – all the kids here. I kind of welled up when I got here.“It’s very, very moving in many ways. To see this reaction from Bury supporters, from people who live in the town who maybe aren’t football fans. This is a tremendous outpouring of community spirit. I’ll be honest, out of adversity over the last few weeks and months this town has really shown its strength.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a37398cec4db100aa5693ae31217e167a2389b8a/0_54_1197_718/master/1197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b89eee4c5315706b539248e79876b59c","title":"tottenham uncertain christian eriksen intentions","story":"• Eriksen is thought to covet Real Madrid or Barcelona move• Injuries force Pochettino to consider makeshift right-backTottenham are in the dark over Christian Eriksen’s intentions regarding the next move of his career because of a breakdown in the relationship between Daniel Levy and the midfielder’s agent.There have been no talks for some time between Levy, Tottenham’s chairman, and Martin Schoots, who represents Eriksen, and it has served to heighten the uncertainty and vulnerability that the club feel over one of their star players – and that Mauricio Pochettino has referenced on more than one occasion.Eriksen has entered the final year on his contract, he has shown no inclination to sign a new one and Spurs believe he has his heart set on a move to Real Madrid or Barcelona. Whether either club bids for him before next Monday’s transfer deadline in Spain remains to be seen.It is more likely that they would prefer to wait until next summer when Eriksen would be available for nothing but, given that Spurs do not have a clear handle on what is in the works for Eriksen, it promises to be an anxious week or so for them.Pochettino, who has started Eriksen in only one of Spurs’ three games this season, said after Sunday’s home defeat against Newcastle that he had not known a more unsettling start to a campaign at the club – and Eriksen’s situation has been a major contributing factor.Spurs have spent £59.9m on players this summer but they hope to recoup around £10m with the sale of the midfielder Victor Wanyama to Club Brugge. They are also open to offers for the right-back Serge Aurier, who is in danger of becoming the club’s forgotten man.Aurier, signed from Paris Saint-Germain for £23m in 2017, has played only one game since February and he is unlikely to be considered for Sunday’s derby at Arsenal, despite Pochettino’s options at right-back being limited.Kyle Walker-Peters is set to miss out with the hamstring injury that forced him off against Newcastle and Juan Foyth is unavailable with an ankle problem. Pochettino is expected to turn to a makeshift right-back – either Moussa Sissoko, who filled the position during the latter stages of the Newcastle game, or Eric Dier."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/65eb759835ab6412d01108c2f3a161f9933f68a8/0_56_3888_2334/master/3888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53179c37bb04010505f289c94861619e","title":"kenya water hyacinth wonder source biofuel","story":"This invasive plant was reviled for clogging rivers but now it’s helping provide cleaner energy and protect healthIt is 9am on the shores of Lake Victoria’s Winam Gulf in Kenya’s Kisumu county. Tourists are arriving on the beach in droves, preparing to spend the day sunbathing and taking boat rides. Behind them, enormous marabou storks on spindly grey legs are pacing the beach, waiting for scraps.Nearby, a group of women scan the horizon, looking for the fishing boats that will soon arrive with their daily catch.But there’s something else on the horizon too, a sheet of water hyacinth pulled over the surface of the lake. The leaves of the floating plant extending like an oversized green shag carpet, rolling gently in the wind.Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), an aquatic plant native to South America, first appeared in countries in Africa in the early 1900s. Scientists there dubbed it the “world’s worst aquatic weed”, after it spread from the Cape in the early 1900s and started clogging up major dams and rivers.In east Africa, the nefarious invader arrived with Belgian colonists in Rwanda, who liked the look of its glossy leaves and delicate purple flowers floating in their garden ponds.But by the 1980s, it had slipped out of Rwanda via the Kagera river and made its way downstream to Lake Victoria.There, with no natural predators and perfect temperature conditions, the plant began gobbling up open space, choking off fishing routes and providing a new habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes. But for women like Keita, it has meant dwindling income, as the boats that once brought silver lake fish to shore by the hundreds struggled to navigate the clogged waters.But water hyacinth isn’t her only headache. Like most women here, to smoke the fish she buys, Keita must gather huge quantities of firewood, sometimes walking as far as 10km each way to collect enough kindling to complete her work. And each day as she cooks, she breathes in the thick, grey woodfire smoke.“I have had chest complications a number of times in the last years,” says Keita, who is chairperson of the local fishmongers’ association.About three out of four families in Kenya depend on wood or charcoal to cook their daily meals, and the rate is even higher in rural areas, Kenya’s latest demographic and health survey shows.Using solid fuels like these for cooking increases indoor pollution. The World Health Organization estimates that about 14,300 Kenyans die annually from conditions linked to indoor air pollution – most of which is caused by cooking and heating sources, the most recent estimates released in 2009 show.Outside Keita’s home on the shores of Lake Victoria, piles of cleared water hyacinth left to rot were a common site. But buried in those decaying waxy leaves was a renewable energy gold mine.It turns out the floating plant isn’t just good at being abundant – its foliage also contains a high ratio of carbon to nitrogen. It’s a magic combination that has captivated researchers’ imaginations since as early as the 1980s when, across the world, they began to explore its potential as a biofuel. Just about 4kg of the dried plant was enough to cater for a large family’s daily energy needs, early research predicted.In 2014, Nigerian academics announced they had got better yields of the gas when they mixed the plant with sanitised chicken manure. A few years later, Kenyan scientists confirmed what their Nigerian peers and others had already found: animal dung worked to power charge the process of converting the weed into gas. In India, scientists took this idea and ran with it, mixing water hyacinth with the more famous Cannabis sativa, the same family of plants that marijuana comes from, as a proposed answer for periodic shortages of cow dung.In 2018, the technology came to Dunga promising a two-for-one solution to the dual menaces of the water hyacinth and dependence on firewood. The community received two donated biogas digesters – machines that would transform a mix of water hyacinth and cow dung into biogas for cooking, as well as material for other household tasks such as incubating chicks and purifying water.The “digesters” work a bit like a stomach. Food goes in one end – think of it as a mouth – and over the next 20 to 30 days, it ferments and breaks down, giving off gas that comes out the other end. From there, the clean-burning gas is piped to the point of use, just like traditional domestic gas.Kenya’s Biogas International company installed the stoves in partnership with the pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the University of Cambridge’s Institute for Sustainability.The project will test whether biogas can provide an effective alternative to firewood and charcoal in rural Kenyan communities.The programme is only months old but, anecdotally, it seems to be working. Keita says the members of her fishmongers’ association are already getting sick less often. And because they don’t have to devote hours a day to walking long distances to collect firewood, they’re making more money as well.Kanyiva Muindi is an epidemiologist and air pollution research fellow at the African Population and Health Research Centre in Nairobi. She says families who switch to the smokeless cooking method could expect fewer respiratory issues and even some forms of cancer because where there’s smoke, there’s PAHs – polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a carcinogen released during burning of certain materials such as wood, corn cobs or cow dung, researchers recently reported.Women, young girls and children are particularly vulnerable because they spend so much time in the kitchen or outside over cooking fires. Worldwide, scientists are still exploring whether PAHs are linked to pockets of high rates of oesophageal cancer in the country.How much better the biogas stoves will be for the community’s health still needs more research, says Dominic Kahumbu Wanjihia, Biogas International’s chief executive. But unless the price of the digesters drops, it’s pretty clear that most communities will never be able to afford the machines, which sell for about $750.Kanyiva says affordability is a challenge worth addressing, given the huge health and environmental dangers posed by “dirty” fuels such as wood, charcoal and kerosene. If biogas could become affordable on a large scale, she says it “would be life-changing for millions on the African continent and beyond”.For Keita, meanwhile, one unexpected benefit of the stoves has been the way they have changed her view of water hyacinth. For years, she had regarded it as little more than a menace. But now, she says, “the hyacinth is becoming a useful resource!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7356f79bcf35b9e9a6d565f50b1f7e8c02372df3/0_1014_4976_2986/master/4976.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeca33f632beb08a3ed054fc14437c7c","title":"ethiopians yemen saudi arabia in pictures","story":"Escaping poverty and drought, Ethiopians are making the dangerous sea crossing from Djibouti to Yemen and then on foot to the Saudi border.

How long did they spend on their phone everyday? Did they think they controlled their phones, or that the phone controlled them?We received 500 responses and did the math: the average  reader seems to spend two and a half hours staring at a screen each day.Among the lowest times is John, from Derby, who said his screen time average is a puny two minutes. He’d swap the time to boil an egg, instead he said, though “it would be a very soft one”.On the other end of the spectrum, some readers wrote to say they spent between eight and 10 hours a day (!) on their phone. (One responder, perhaps not surprisingly, asked to remain anonymous).Heavy users reported feeling stress and a foggy feeling when using certain social media apps. Overall there were 75 mentions of Instagram, 52 of Facebook, 41 of Twitter and 39 mentions of the  app (thanks for reading).Of course, take those results with a grain of salt: this is a self-selecting group.At six hours per day, Jessica Louise from Redhill says her average is affecting her relationship. “My partner often feels like there’s a screen between us”, she said. He wishes she could be more present while they’re watching movies at home. Yet, she is “awfully addicted to infantile games” like Candy Crush or Angry Birds.“What horrifies me is that I spend essentially a whole day on my phone each week,” said Jennifer Corlington in Sitges, Spain. She is making an effort not to use her phone in front of her kids, in an attempt to lead by example. “Either we’re with them or we’re on our phones but you can’t really do both,” she said.Ashleigh Young, from Wellington, said: “I do the classic mindless, almost catatonic scrolling of Twitter and often it makes me feel stressed or just flat, so I have now deleted Twitter from my phone and just have it for my laptop, so it feels a bit more conscious.” She added: “Maybe I should spend time differently, but then I’d have to face reality and that’s not a great option these days.”Mick Greer, from Saigon, said he has “no desire to learn the tuba or write the next great novel”, so he is not planning to change how he uses his one hour of daily screen time.Other responders were happy with their phone usage because they found their use of it was intentional, and spending four or five hours a day on it made sense to them.“Anyone who might judge a person for looking at their phone is clearly not thinking of the vast number of things they could be doing with it,” said Victoria from Swindon. Her daily eight hours helps improves her quality of life, as she trades messages and banters over Discord with her friends living abroad. Nightly guided meditations help her get to sleep, and music and games help her get through a noisy commute.Then there are those who made the conscious choice to gear their use away from recreation – little to no fun, purely function.Natalie, from Birmingham, is embarrassed of her four-hour time, which racks up during her 40-minute train commute. She uses the Google Digital Wellbeing app to set timers on her commonly used apps. “I am now allowed only 15 minutes on Reddit and this is more than enough,” she discovered.Opening Headspace motivates reader Joseph Slater from Cambodia who reminds us what Rod Judkins wrote in The Art of Creative Thinking:There is an art to doing nothing, intensely. The geniuses of the 21st century will be those who can unplug from the unyielding flow of incoming communications: emails, texts, tweets, Facebook, phone calls, and on and on. There’s no hiding place from screens we work at them they entertain us … To work intensively for long periods you need to switch off occasionally for short periods.”Lee Rice, from St Asaph, decided to go back to the dark ages and sold his smartphone last year. He says “life is a million percent better with a dumb phone”.For others, like Judah from Oslo, keeping it simple has been enough: “The best solution is to put the phone down. Even gazing out the window on my commute would be more mentally productive.”The bottom line? If these responses say anything, it’s not about how much screen time you accumulate or how you use it, but rather how you feel about your use.Take a step back and consider your screen time: do you feel depressed about it? Do you know, deep down, that you’d rather learn Chinese or make pasta from scratch? Or are you happy being connected to your loved ones all day?Once you have your answer, go all the way and switch back to a Nokia brick. Or, keep your iPhone X if your eyes have developed an insatiable taste for blue light. If you’re happy, we’re happy.(But, we can agree that 12 hours is ludicrous, right?)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a22e3f9e70a5a4bfd4fcc9774b60f0eb9e4b816/0_82_5022_3012/master/5022.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a69cb1972548c04563dedada3500156","title":"childhood happiness lowest level in decade says report","story":"Charity describes finding that 200,000 are not content with their lives as ‘national scandal’Childhood happiness has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, with more than 200,000 children unhappy with their lives, according to a report.For the first time since it was launched in 2009-10, the annual Good Childhood report found overall contentment among 10- to 15-year-olds has dipped below eight on a scale of one to 10. It now stands at 7.89 on average, down from a high of 8.21 in 2011, at a time when adult wellbeing is improving.The Children’s Society, which conducted the research, said the decline in childhood happiness was a national scandal. The charity called on Boris Johnson to move the issue to the top of his agenda and introduce a national measurement of children’s wellbeing.The report is based on an annual survey of about 2,400 households and a longitudinal study involving 40,000 households.It found a significant dip in contentment about friends and school among both boys and girls and an increase in unhappiness among boys about their appearance.Asked why he is unhappy with his appearance, one boy surveyed said: “Like Instagram and stuff, right? You see all these models, you see all these weightlifters, bodybuilders, and you look at yourself and you’re like: ‘I look like a stick.’ I feel like we’re exposed to a lot more, so we are less secure about our appearance.”Richard Crellin, the policy and research manager at the Children’s Society, said the research provided observational data, so it was difficult to pinpoint reasons for the decline in childhood happiness.“The latest ONS data for adults suggests wellbeing is increasing and improving. Adults tend to be slightly less happy than children, but the proportion with high wellbeing is improving, whereas it is declining for children.”Mark Russell, the chief executive of the Children’s Society, said: “Modern childhood is a happy and carefree time for most, yet for too many it is not. It is a national scandal that children’s unhappiness is increasing so quickly.“We are urging the government to introduce a national measurement of children’s wellbeing so we can really listen, respond and show young people they matter.”Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, said the report should act as “wake-up call to ministers”.He added: “Our children’s health should be a national priority, yet after nine years of austerity, the government’s response to the issue of child health has been piecemeal as it continues to squeeze the NHS and take money from our public health system and schools.”A government spokeswoman said: “We want young people growing up in a modern Britain to feel confident tackling the challenges life throws at them. That is why we’re giving teachers the power to deal with bad behaviour and bullying in the classroom, investing billions every year in mental health support for young people, and providing quicker access to specialist treatment where needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d19df985060b01b2aa77af69e64d0686de3432ab/0_52_5166_3100/master/5166.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4c61a12dddafe4eb697a446fdf0307b","title":"helping nine year old eating disorder recovery podcast","story":"We hear about the importance of early intervention in rare cases of pre-teen eating disorders.

After limping off the court on 16 August she was resolute: “In the end, I’m going to play even if the doctor says no.”The 21 year-old played with a support on her left knee but her movement looked comfortable throughout. It was her ground strokes that were the problem as she struggled to find consistency.“I don’t think I’ve ever been this nervous in my life,” Osaka said. “She played really amazing and for me I just came off really slow. For me, I don’t think I found my rhythm but I fought as hard as I could.”Osaka reeled off five successive games to take the first set 6-4 but after grabbing hold of the match the world No 1 lost the tie-break in the second. Early in the final set, Osaka was forced to save three break points.“There were moments where I played really well, and then moments where I didn’t play as well,” she said. “I think as a whole, I just need to learn how to stay more consistent on the good side.”The two-time grand slam champion’s victory at the Australian Open in January completed her ascension to the number one ranking, but much of her year has seen her learn to deal with the attention and pressure of being the best. Against Blinkova, she resolved to stand up to the pressure.“I remember two years ago I played Kerber here,” said Osaka. “She was the defending champion. And I could see how stressed out she was when I was playing her. I don’t want to give people that look.“Elsewhere, Wimbledon champion Simona Halep scuppered lucky loser Nicole Gibbs, while 19 year-old Canadian sensation Bianca Andreescu, who captured the Rogers Cup title at home in Toronto earlier this month, eased past 17 year-old Katie Volynets 6-2 6-4.Sixth seed Petra Kvitova, who has been troubled by a forearm injury since withdrawing from the French Open, moved on with a 6-2 6-4 win against qualifier Denisa Allertova."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a86f9b6495cdd2807b53a6f5feb1a18732ee80fe/0_73_3126_1876/master/3126.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3025a2e566b1e0d179417a9cd05023ba","title":"us open tennis kyle edmund pablo andujar stefanos tsitsipas","story":"• Briton tired at end of match to lose in five sets• Stefanos Tsitsipas unhappy with umpire in his defeatThere is no good way to lose a match but some are better than others. Kyle Edmund can be proud that, unlike Stefanos Tsitsipas, he left the US Open with his dignity intact, fighting for every second of the four hours and 21 minutes it took Pablo Andújar to subdue him in five sets of the most honest endeavour.The same could not be said of the noisy exit of Tsitsipas, who was heard to say “You’re all weirdos” to Damien Dumusois after the respected French umpire had warned him about interjections from his box in the latter stages of his match against Andry Rublev. The determined young Russian won 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (7), 7-5 in three hours and 54 minutes, the longest match of his career.Out too, went the fourth seed and two-time French Open finalist, Dominic Thiem, almost quietly in two hours and 23 minutes as Thomas Fabbiano put together a workmanlike 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 result. The unseeded Italian did the same to Tsitsipas at Wimbledon, which ignited a surlier response than his reaction to defeat on Tuesday.“The umpire was very incorrect,” Tsitsipas said. “I don’t know what he has against my team but he was complaining about them all the time. I never heard anything from my team from outside the court or to make me play better.”It would seem to be open season on umpires, a regrettable development.Edmund, meanwhile, was a model of decorum. Perhaps he is still too nice.Maybe there is a case for him to find his inner Tsitsipas. Or not he cannot deny his nature. Also, credit must go to 33-year-old Andujar for outlasting him in a 3-6, 7-6 (1), 7-5, 5-7, 6-2 win of several twists and turns.Edmund has struggled with a knee injury since the 2018 Paris Masters but insisted on his arrival in New York that it felt fabulous that public declaration of health held up well enough, although there was a noticeable power outage at the very end.It was a match he would have expected to win, despite losing heavily to the Spaniard the only time they had met previously, in Marrakesh last year.They exchanged breaks here in a stuttering start, although Andujar, pinned deep by a heavy forehand, looked the more vulnerable.He has had his moments in a long career but three elbow surgeries and long absences have hindered his game, so they were trading physical frailties.The British No 1 could not cash in on three break points in the fourth game but still had his nose in front after half an hour and kept it there. He punished Andujar’s second serve to break again with a rocket of a forehand and served out the set in 40 minutes. All looked well.The second set was following the pattern of the first until Edmund, 3-1 and 4-2 up, lost focus as Andujar fought back to force a tie-break, where he duly pounced to level.Edmund’s box started to worry when he dropped a close third set but he came to life brilliantly at the end of the fourth, breaking Andujar to love with four exquisite winners across both wings and they were back on equal terms in a close, fascinating match.Edmund held and broke at the start of the fifth with a well-constructed backhand at the net to suggest he would finish the stronger of the two, but he handed the advantage back straight away. Andujar saved three break points in the fourth game, Edmund four in the 13-minute fifth – but not a fifth, as Andujar’s backhand teased the back line.After four-and-a-quarter hours Edmund’s fatigue kicked in hard and he was broken to love. Andujar went to match point with his seventh ace, Edmund’s legs leaving him rooted to the spot. Then his arms gave up on him as he framed the last shot of the match.Andujar will be tired, too. How much he has left for the second round on Thursday is unknown. He plays the 24-year-old Italian Lorenzo Sonego and, while the world No 49 has rarely lived up to his potential, he was too good for the experienced Spaniard, Marcel Granollers, winning 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 on Court 9 in two hours and 21 minutes.Elsewhere on that side of the draw, the 2014 champion, Marin Cilic gave fans on Court 5 value for money, beating the Slovak Martin Klizan 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (6). Alexander Zverev suffered for his win, though, taking five sets to see off the world No 41, Radu Albot, on Court 17."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3a7293555ec01fc94cdb567f174bf880ae3ae37/0_0_4360_2617/master/4360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86f3e2dc8350c233b0787b69d24beb89","title":"greatest cricket test of all headingley 2019 ashes","story":"Being broad-minded, we had an unbeliever to stay the weekend. At some point on Sunday afternoon I yelled out of the window: “You’ve got to come and see this! It’s the most astonishing game!” A languorous, world-weary voice replied from the garden: “Cricket! Always astonishing. Always historic. Always unprecedented.” She never budged.It is true that this was cricket’s second astonishing-historic-unprecedented Sunday in six weeks. It is also true it was being shown on Sky, whose policy is that everything must be treated as a-h-u even if it’s a goalless draw between Barrow and Boreham Wood. Which makes it hard to recognise an a-h-u when you see it. And on Sunday we really did (except our visitor).On such occasions, it is easy to get confused between a great game and a great finish. The World Cup final was a fairly typical 50-over contest, spiced up by the gravity of the occasion and the StokesButtler‑led revival of the England innings. Planet Earth spectacularly lurched off its axis in the final moments but Headingley ’19 had more.There have been 2,358 Test matches played since 1877. In terms of closeness Headingley 2019 has a lot of competition. Two Tests have been tied, both involving Australia, against West Indies and India. Two have been drawn with the scores level and the fourth innings still in progress, the first being the “we flippin’ murdered ’em” Test in Bulawayo in 1996, named after the scorecard-defying response of England’s coach, David Lloyd, perhaps the most quoted of all his many quotable comments.There has been a one-run win (West Indies over Australia in 1993), a two- runner (Edgbaston 2005 of beloved memory) and two three‑runners, also both Ashes Tests, at Old Trafford in 1902 and Melbourne 80 years later. This time England’s win was by one wicket, which is in itself no big deal. It was the 14th in all and not even the first this year (Sri Lanka did the same to South Africa in February).Indeed, 18 Ashes Tests have been decided by one or two wickets or fewer than 20 runs. The score in these matches is 13-5 to England, and Australia’s last win was in 1925. This stat must mean something but I’m not sure what. The British ability to defy seemingly impossible odds (Betfair made them a 35-1 chance at one stage on Sunday)?England were of course 500-1 at Headingley in 1981 but that was more PR stunt than serious assessment. There is a school of thought that this long-ago win wrecked English cricket for years, making the team dependent on blind optimism rather than logic, practice and application. For God’s sake don’t pass the 13-5 figure to Downing Street. It’ll make things 10 times worse.Many superlatives have been offered these past couple of days. For Ben Stokes and his magnificent sidekick Jack Leach: Sancho Panza to his Quixote Tonto to his Lone Ranger Passepartout to his Phileas Fogg. Their stand passes the a-h-u exam with flying colours. Stokes took dozens of risks and got away with them brilliantly. It was indeed the stuff of fiction. But the greatest innings of all time, as some suggest? It might not be quite the same (an old fogey writes) as a few of Don Bradman’s.Assessing whether this was the greatest cricket match ever played is also tricky. Quality would be one criterion and, as we all know, England’s first-innings batting was atrocious. And Australia were without their best player. You do remember Steve Smith? But you can only play the opposition who turn up and quality is also hard to quantify. All sport is about making fewer mistakes than the opposition.Was Headingley compelling from start to finish? Almost. Australia’s second innings was a dire time but perhaps not to an Australian. And in hindsight that slow buildup of English pain was crucial to the plot – the way great detective novels accrete evidence, all pointing to the wrong suspect.Above all, because the Ashes were on the line, presumed already won and lost, the match had context. Headingley in 1981 and Edgbaston in 2005 were important battles that turned the tide at the time but both came early in the series and neither could have settled the war on their own, whoever won.The most enjoyable Test I watched involved Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart defying the West Indies quicks and conjuring a three-wicket victory in Trinidad in 1998. But that was a very personal memory and meant little in the great scheme of things. Athers was gone as captain five weeks later, something that may yet happen to Joe Root in three.The most compelling I remember was the Centenary Test at Melbourne in March 1977. The Ashes were not at stake – it was a one-off – and it was invisible from Britain but the memory of listening from my dingy flat to Derek Randall’s epic 174 is with me for ever. Hardly anyone knew the camaraderie of that occasion was greased by the fact most of the players were plotting to desert Test cricket and join the breakaway led by the tycoon Kerry Packer.The original tied Test, in Brisbane in 1960, had an impact that surged across the cricketing world. Hardly anyone saw it at the time – even Australia’s No 1 commentator, Alan McGilvray, was so certain of defeat he took an early plane home. But it set up a terrific series: the excitement, after much dourness in the 1950s, the class of the players and the amity between the teams helped rekindle enthusiasm for the game.With that match a close second, I think – for its twists, turns and thrills and its collective and inidual sense of redemption – Headingley ’19 may be the best of them all.Note to readers: The above column contains no criticism of the ECB, ICC, MCC or any other component of the alphabet soup that runs cricket.

Can they survive the next decade?John Farmer, who describes himself as an activist shareholder, is a man with a mission – to save Britain’s red phone boxes. These were once a feature of every high street in the country, but now number only 10,000 or so (and half of those are decorative rather than operational). At the recent annual general meeting of British Telecom, which even in the age of the mobile phone has a statutory obligation to maintain a payphone network, Farmer demanded that more be done to maintain the traditional red boxes. It was a point he has made at past AGMs – always, he says, to audience applause.In 2015 the traditional red phone box was voted the greatest British design of all time, ahead of the Routemaster bus, the Spitfire, the union jack and Concorde. It was designed in 1924 by the architect Sir Giles Gilbert Scott, whose other creations include Liverpool’s Anglican cathedral and Battersea and Bankside power stations. Many believe Scott’s design echoes the tomb that the architect Sir John Soane built for his wife in 1815.In his 1989 monograph on phone boxes, the architectural historian Gavin Stamp called Scott’s cast-iron box “a classical design of refined sophistication and timeless elegance”. Stamp was a great enthusiast for Scott’s boxes and led a campaign to preserve them after they ceased production in 1968.In his book he lauds Scott’s original design, designated Kiosk No 2 (usually abbreviated to K2) by the General Post Office, which was then responsible for the phone network. “The Kiosk No 2 was a miniature building,” he writes. Scott’s K2 design, easily identified by its small, square windows, was superseded in 1936 by his K6, which was smaller and had larger, horizontal windows to let more light into the box. The K2 had never caught on outside London because it was expensive, but the cheaper K6 was adopted nationally and by the late 1960s, when the utilitarian K8 was introduced, designed by the architect Bruce Martin, there were more than 70,000 in use across the country.There are still numerous Scott kiosks in central London, many of which have been listed as historically or architecturally significant – a response to the destruction of many boxes by the newly formed British Telecom in the 1980s. Remarkably Scott’s original wooden prototype still stands outside the Royal Academy in Piccadilly. Across the UK, more than 3,000 kiosks have been listed, including all the K2s, so there is no danger of them disappearing from Britain’s streets. Neil Scoresby, BT’s general manager for payphones, tells me a revolution in payphones is under way, reflecting the fact that only about 30,000 calls a day are now made from them. Over the next decade, most of the current 31,000 street kiosks (they are mostly ugly, post-Scott designs) will be swept away and replaced by three metre-tall InLink pillars and other devices that combine free calls with wi-fi services and are funded by advertising, but about 2,500 red boxes will be retained and converted for digital use.The fact there were once more than 70,000 red kiosks and now only 10,000 remain on the streets suggests that a lot of boxes have disappeared. In the 1970s and 80s, many were melted down, but gradually aficionados such as Stamp fought back and the boxes’ aesthetic (and indeed monetary) value started to be recognised. Since 2008, rather than remove decommissioned ones that have not been listed, BT has allowed local councils and charities to repurpose them under its adopt-a-kiosk scheme. More than 5,000 have been adopted.Many now contain defibrillators, with the Community Heartbeat Trust leading the way in advising local authorities on conversion. The trust has adopted 1,300 boxes, more than half of which have been converted to house defibrillators. Other uses for the boxes are rich and varied. Book-swap points that double as miniature libraries are popular. The village of Marton cum Grafton in North Yorkshire was one of the pioneers, opening a mini-library in 2010 another was opened in the London borough of Lewisham in 2013. I visited the latter and was impressed by the range of books. Not just airport fodder, but novels by Orhan Pamuk and Henning Mankell, an ancient book of English poetry and the catalogue of the Mezipatra Queer film festival, with text in Czech and English.The box was adopted by the Brockley Society and is now looked after by Susan Bennett and Tom Simpson, although Bennett says it is largely self-managing. People bring books in, take the odd one away and take it upon themselves to tidy up the seven shelves. The Lewisham “microlibrary” was started by the artist Sebastian Handley. He has now left the area, but the idea has been carried on. One thing that worried me about BT’s adopt-a-kiosk scheme was whether some ideas might founder when the original volunteers moved on or lost their enthusiasm. By only allowing councils and charities, rather than iniduals, to adopt, BT hopes to ensure continuity, but I still think there could be problems further down the line. Who will be looking after these boxes in 50 years’ time, and making sure they get a fresh coat of “currant-red” paint?Art galleries in old phone boxes are also popular – an idea pioneered by the Gallery on the Green in Settle, north Yorkshire, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. “A group of residents thought it would be a shame for the box to go, and the idea of a gallery came up,” says Mike Smith, one of the half-dozen local people who keep it afloat. “The thought that it would probably be the smallest one in the world was kicked around and Guinness World Records was approached, but they said they weren’t interested in definitively ruling on it, so the Carlsberg advert was used instead … probably the smallest one. That generated a lot of publicity at the time of the launch in 2009.”Attempts have been made to monetise some boxes, in partnership with the Red Kiosk Company, which has bought 124 boxes from BT under the adopt-a-box scheme (BT sells them for a nominal £1, although it retains a residual interest in their use in an effort to ensure its brand is protected). The company gets planning permission for traders to use the boxes, and charges about £300 a month to rent a box.Mustafa Mehmet runs a coffee stall in a kiosk in Hampstead, north London. He originally did the same thing in west London, but says he was driven out by Hounslow council’s insistence that he have a street traders’ licence. The problem comes when kiosk traders spill over on to the pavement, which is almost inevitable – try selling coffee to a customer with both buyer and seller inside the box. Hounslow council, he says, insisted the transaction should take place inside the box Camden council, under whose jurisdiction Mehmet is now trading, allows a bit of leeway.Phone repair company Lovefone has a kiosk in Holborn, central London, in which it repairs cracked iPhone screens. The Lovefone technician who works there, Fouad Choaibi, loves it. “This is my office,” he says. He has been based in the box for two and a half years and has embedded himself in the community, making himself indispensable to locals with cracked iPhones. The kiosk is very profitable, proving it can be done if you get the concept right. But the high degree of churn in other kiosks suggests a lot of traders don’t and quickly lose interest.Next to the pier in Brighton, Senegal-born Abo Fall is selling hats, sunglasses and beachwear out of two adjacent boxes. He has been there for two years and is keeping his head above the waves, but he says it can be a struggle if the weather’s bad. “People like the boxes and it’s different from an ordinary shop,” he says. Wherever you see a red box, you will see someone taking a picture of it, although, as the traders know all too well, that doesn’t automatically mean they will buy a coffee or a sunhat.The boxes are also useful for stunts. In 2011, residents in the Cambridgeshire village of Shepreth opened a pub (called the Dog and Bone, of course) in the local phone box to protest about the closure of their real local. The campaign seems to have paid off because that pub, the Plough, reopened in 2014. Incredibly, I can find no evidence of any plays being performed in a phonebox at the Edinburgh festival. Next year I plan to give my Hamlet in a kiosk on the Royal Mile. Though this be madness, yet there is method in it.Iniduals can also buy boxes that aren’t listed and have no prospective adopter, so are being removed. A box in poor condition will set you back almost £2,000 on eBay, or you can buy a refurbished K6 for £2,750 (plus VAT and delivery) through BT’s approved reseller X2Connect. Unicorn Restorations also supplies beautifully restored boxes – at eye-watering prices if you want a rare K2 – drawing on stock it accumulated in the 1980s and 90s when unwanted and unloved red boxes were plentiful.“We supply boxes to private buyers and commercial organisations,” says a director of X2Connect, Martin White. “They go all round the world. We’ve done shopping malls in Florida and Dubai. They’re very popular in Australia and America, but places in Europe take them as well. People put them in their gardens and companies have them in their offices. They buy them as birthday presents or just for themselves, telling us it’s something they’ve always wanted.” White says that eventually the supply will dry up, but his company has enough to keep it going for a good few years yet.The cult of the boxes is a strange and powerful one. The sculptor David Mach, who 30 years ago laid 12 of them end to end in the centre of Kingston upon Thames in a celebrated piece of public art called Out of Order, describes them as a “universal Great British thing”. “The design is fantastic,” he says, “and then it seeps wholesale into the ground and comes back up through the soles of your feet.” They have featured on a million postcards and, having been a central feature of British life for much of the 20th century, in many films. Tourists still go to the fishing village of Pennan in Aberdeenshire in search of the phone box that features prominently in the 1983 film Local Hero, not realising that the box used in the film was a wooden prop. Pennan does have a real box, with a less perfect view of the sea than in the film, so visitors make do with that.Scott’s kiosks are loved in part because they are redolent of a time when the British were willing to build a small house from which anyone could make a call. They represent civic pride and national confidence – both now in short supply. Farmer is horrified at my suggestion that we should just let them go. Objects have a use, so why keep them when they lose that use? He finds such iconoclasm detestable. “We don’t want to become like the Americans,” he says. By which I presume he means a throwaway society. But equally the veneration of the past can go too far. We surround Battersea power station with anodyne, absurdly pricey flats and tell ourselves we have rescued it, even though it has lost all its stark beauty.I wonder how Scott’s K2s and K6s will look 50 years from now, when everyone has forgotten why they were ever there and thinks they were built as micro-libraries and art galleries, coffee kiosks and collection points. Or in 1,000 years when, as with Stonehenge, our descendants will ascribe some deep religious significance to them. Which, given the way they are now worshipped, might not be far from the truth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d78c9820f7887e5906f7ee020bc9b7c0626b915/357_90_2648_1589/master/2648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e7cb6a536122df55d4bbb302eb51be","title":"when chase is on his computer he feels like any other nine year old","story":"Nikki Hunter-Pike explains how accessibility technology has opened up the online world to her son, who has cerebral palsyIt’s Saturday morning at Nikki Hunter-Pike’s home. While she prepares breakfast, and her husband Daniel plays with their daughters Brooke and Harper, her son Chase is engrossed in sending an email to his beloved stepgrandfather, “Pops”, his face a study in intense concentration.Nine-year-old Chase, who has the neurological condition cerebral palsy, cannot walk, talk, feed himself or pick up a pen. Yet, thanks to technology that’s widely available, he can communicate, learn and explore the online world from his family’s home in Northfleet, Kent.On his computer, “Chase uses the on-screen keyboard (OSK) tool, because he doesn’t have the fine motor skills to type on a keyboard,” says Nikki. Running on Windows 10, “it displays a visual keyboard with all the standard keys. Using a joystick that he can control with just his thumb, once he switches on the OSK, he can do everything from browse the internet to search for videos on YouTube and write emails. We introduced him to it when he was six and it really has been life-changing for him.“Because he can’t speak or type messages on a phone, being able to write emails to his friends and close family is so important to him – it helps him feel connected.“The keyboard also has a text prediction function, which suggests words for him as he types. It makes it quicker for him, and, because he has learning difficulties too, it helps him with his spelling.“When I see him on his computer, and how its technology empowers him, it fills me with confidence that as he grows up he’ll be able to lead a fulfilling, independent life. That is all I’ve ever wanted for him.”Nikki’s hopes for her son are mirrored by Microsoft’s mission to empower every person through building inclusivity into technology, such as the Windows 10 operating system, which supports the OSK and its Office 365 suite.After a normal, healthy pregnancy, Nikki says she was devastated when Chase was born with brain damage, having been deprived of oxygen during her labour.“The hardest part was the uncertainty. No one knew how severe his level of disability would be, and for the first few years of his life it felt like I was living in limbo watching and waiting to see what milestones he would reach, or not,” says Nikki.“He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was nine months old, but it wasn’t until he was around three that the full extent of his disability was clear. He’s never spoken, he can’t stand unaided, and he suffers from almost constant involuntary movements of his limbs. His reading ability is closer to that of a five-year-old. He’s also incredibly loving, with a wonderful sense of humour and a very determined personality.”While Chase uses an electric wheelchair and requires round-the-clock care, Nikki says technology gives him the independence he craves.“He’s well aware his siblings and other children don’t need the same help he does. But when he’s on his computer, he feels like any other nine-year-old, because he’s in control and he doesn’t need any assistance,” says Nikki. “That means so much to him and it’s vital for his self-confidence.“I see how he puffs up with pride when he shows his little sisters, who are five and three, something he’s discovered online – his current obsession is looking at locations around the world on Google Maps. It gives him the chance to be the big brother and take the lead.”A keen gamer too, Chase uses his Microsoft adaptive controller to access his Xbox console.“We all game together as a family. It can be stressful going out because of the challenges Chase can face with poor disability access and toilet facilities. Sometimes it’s just nice to stay at home and have a relaxed afternoon gaming and cuddling up on the sofa.”Summing up how much the technology means to her son, Nikki says: “It’s no exaggeration to say Chase’s computer is his window to the world. I can’t imagine his life without it and I’m thankful he was born at a time when technology like this exists.“It’s so important to him and, thanks to its emphasis on inclusivity, it’s the one part of his life in which he can be completely independent.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

He tells  Lucy Jolin about how he started his travel blogging business with The Deaf Traveller, and the tech that helps himTravel blogger Ed Rex has had plenty of memorable moments in his career to date, from snorkelling in Fiji to marvelling at the Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina. But one of the most memorable was when he accidentally signed up for a job at a nudist resort in Australia.“The plan was to work at resorts in return for bed and breakfast,” he says with a grin. “The resort sent me a nice email saying they were looking forward to me coming and would pick me up – and by the way, we’re nudists: is that OK with you? And I had to be nude as well. That was a challenge! I’ve certainly never done naked gardening in the UK ...”Rex was born deaf, but he’s never let that stand in the way of his determination to experience life to the full. He studied environmental biology and science at the University of Leeds and worked in the sector for several years before jacking in his job to see the world.“I’d always had a love of travel but I didn’t have anyone to travel with, and I didn’t have the confidence to travel on my own,” he says. “Then, just before I left my last job, I had an operation to insert a cochlear implant into my right ear, as the hearing in that ear had gone completely. I was struggling to be involved in social situations, and feeling pretty down.”While the operation isn’t the preferred choice for all, for Rex it made a huge difference. “I was a completely different person,” he says. “Suddenly, I had so much confidence. So off I went, around the world. That was the start of the travel blogging, too. I realised I had a love of storytelling.”Rex charts all his travels on his blog, rexyedventures (strapline: “Adventures of a handsome backpacker travelling the unexpected”), which quickly caught the attention of major brands, including KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, MyDestination and Hotel.info. These days he’s a well-known figure on the travel blogger scene. He’s often asked to go on trips and to review accommodation and experiences – recent adventures include quad biking in Australia and two weeks in South Africa. And he’s written widely about his experiences as a deaf traveller too, on rexyedventures and his Deaf Traveller blog.There have been challenges, of course, as well as some some odd attitudes. “I remember one Australian guy saying: ‘Can I catch deafness from you?’ which was bizarre! I took out my hearing aid, which I use for my left ear, and said: ‘Quick, quick, the germs are on the loose!’ But most of the time, it’s fine. Sometimes people have questions but they are afraid to ask, so you have to start the conversation yourself. For me, deafness is not a taboo subject and you can make fun of yourself. It’s part of who you are.”But odd attitudes like the earlier one are rare, he points out. “Most of the time it’s just about looking after yourself and making sure you’re not in a situation where you could be vulnerable. I’ve always felt quite safe. And if something happens – like being dropped off by a bus in Thailand in the middle of nowhere – it’s fine if you don’t lose your cool and get stressed.”Rex is a keen user and advocate of better accessibility tech – he’s passionate about the need to get British transport right, particularly train companies that still use tannoys to make announcements. He’s pleased that Microsoft’s most recent software is taking steps in the right direction.“I particularly like the visual notification feature, which sets the screen to flash, rather than making a sound, and the accessibility checker on Word, Excel and Powerpoint,” he says. “Subtitling is great: it’s a massive thing to be able to turn on subtitles in Powerpoint,” he says, adding that it gets better every time you use it.“You can get subtitles for every video on the web, too. And I’ve used Skype for yonks, but I never realised before that you can turn on subtitles for every single Skype call, and you can download the transcript at the end of it. That’s so good for business meetings.”In the future, Rex is looking forward to more trips and continuing to use his platform to inspire others and break down stereotypes, particularly among young people.“Deafness is associated with people who are old! But there are so many deaf kids who don’t have any role models. And there’s a wide spectrum of deafness, too: people who use sign language, people who have mild hearing loss and so on. I want to say: you can do this. If I can do it, you can do it. It’s all about standing up and believing in yourself,” he says.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Computer software is essential to her dual career, writes  Sue George“Teaching yoga, hosting yoga brunch events and doing a full-time finance contract is pretty tiring,” says Jemma Ralston, “but it is so exciting because I am in control. All these things I am choosing to do. Yoga is my passion.”Ralston teaches ashtanga vinyasa yoga in classes across London and – alongside her new yoga business – she also works as an accountant.Ralston has a condition called Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) that leads to problems with blood clotting, causing easy bruising and prolonged bleeding. It also involves nystagmus – uncontrolled eye movements, leading to reduced vision and depth perception.After university in Glasgow, Ralston went to work in Jersey on a graduate training scheme. “I was thrown in at the deep end,” she says. “Being a trainee auditor and visually impaired wasn’t easy. A lot of my work was going through papers with a red pen.” She had to pass some tough accountancy exams. “Things take me longer to read than they might for a person with 20-20 vision. Yes, things were sometimes tough. But not that bad,” she laughs.While she was working in Jersey, Ralston started yoga classes and immediately felt the impact on her stress levels and long-term anxiety. “I felt at home. As someone who grew up with a few physical ailments, I thought: ‘I can do this! I feel relaxed!’ I understand what the instructor is telling me and I can listen to my body.”Three years later, she was working in London as a senior-level accountant at a large corporation. After a painful relationship breakup, she travelled on her own to Thailand, where she practised yoga every day for a month. “From then on, I knew I was going to be a yoga teacher. I didn’t know when. I had a successful job in the City and had worked very hard. But I knew I would when the time was right.”That time came three years ago. Her father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and she had an incident with her blood condition where she went into cardiac arrest. “That was when I made the decision. A couple of days later, I booked my teacher training,” she says.She qualified in October 2017 and left her full-time City job three months later. Ralston began teaching classes all over London, soon deciding the best plan was to be a contractor in the finance sector while she established her yoga business.Her corporate background is a good complement to her yoga business. “Yoga teachers don’t do it for the money – we do it because we love teaching. But I would like to find a way where I can teach and live a comfortable life. I think my knowledge of finance and business models will help me on that journey.”As soon as she starts a contract in a new office, Ralston sets up Ease of Access Center in Windows 10. “I tend to ‘lose’ the mouse cursor, and the larger the monitor, the more space there is to lose it in. I make the mouse cursor bigger so I can follow it,” she says. Ease of Access options also allow her to use the Narrator function, meaning that she can hear audio descriptions of elements on the screen, something she may need if her sight deteriorates.The Ease of Access Center enables Ralston to increase the size of, and contrast within, documents. Working with spreadsheets for her own business, or with financial modelling for clients, she uses Excel and changes the text to be white on a black background. She also finds the search function helpful, rather than having to look through documents for particular figures.Right now, she has yoga brunch events to organise, and technology can help with that. “When I am on the computer for a long time, I use the Magnifier tool because my eyes get tired, especially for things like proofreading,” she says. “It’s about independence. These things are here to help everyone.“I can accept my body as not perfect – but no one’s is,” she continues. “We all have our limitations and have things we can excel at. It’s about appreciating what you can do.”Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device, or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops whatever your need.

Sue George finds out howLike many teenagers, Ella Warren-Roberts, 14, is very creative. She makes slate jewellery, she does woodcutting, and paints in watercolours. “She always has more than one project on the go,” says her proud mother, Glenda Roberts. “And she always completes them.”“So I don’t get too stressed out on one thing, I can relax by doing another,” says Ella. This lively, cheerful teenager also really likes science but, until recently, she wasn’t able to shine at it. She struggled reading science questions and her work took too long. But now, she is third in her year at chemistry.Ella is a day pupil, and Glenda is a teacher, at St David’s college, an independent boarding and day school in north Wales for children aged nine to 19. The school prides itself on teaching mixed classes, where pupils with additional learning needs, and those with none, work together to reach their full potential. Many of the pupils, like Ella, have dyslexia, and teachers, such as Glenda, have been trained at Bangor University to work with dyslexic learners. Some teachers bring their dogs to work, which pupils – including Ella – find very calming. “I have anxiety, and animals really help me. They aren’t judgemental,” she says.Using a computer for her schoolwork has also played a part in reducing Ella’s anxiety – which came about because it took her longer than others to complete certain tasks. “It made me feel more stupid than anyone else,” she says firmly. But now she realises that she isn’t stupid and her past problems with reading and writing have eased greatly.The apps and programs available with Office 365 allow this to happen smoothly. For instance, the school has a OneNote account used by both pupils and teachers. OneNote is a collaborative digital notebook that can be typed into, drawn or written on, and visual or audio clips can be added to it. Teachers use it to compile worksheets pupils then work on them online.Glenda points to the Microsoft Edge immersive reader, part of Microsoft’s learning tools, and the assistance this tool can give learners across a range of programs, including OneNote and Word. For instance, it can highlight words or sentences, or split inidual words into their component syllables – something that can also help anyone learning in an additional language.Ella uses it to change the background colour on her screen: she finds it easier to read on a sepia tone, where there is no glare. Previously, she relied on teachers printing worksheets on coloured paper. Then there is the choice of fonts. She can immediately choose a font she finds legible. “I used to be behind everyone else, but now I’m on target,” she says.For Glenda, Microsoft programs have also been a big help. Last year, she was away from work for nine months after being diagnosed with endometrial cancer. “I was in dire straits,” she says. “They gave me three months to live.” She is currently on the anti-cancer drug Avastin and is still going to the Christie hospital in Manchester for treatment.OneNote helped her feel less isolated when she was off work, and even in hospital the apps on her phone helped her keep track of how her pupils were getting on. “I might be part-time, but I am invested,” she says confidently.Using the Microsoft Teams platform, she was able to see what they were learning and could make comments to help their teachers.Both Glenda and Ella are physically active, doing the Race for Life 5k together. They live in an area where outdoor activities are popular people come to the family’s Airbnb to enjoy the nearby mountaineering. Her school also gives Ella the opportunity to enjoy another of her hobbies: wakeboarding. This sport is similar to waterskiing, but with one board instead of two skis. Ella describes it as “like snowboarding, if the snow had melted”.Whether you’re looking to upgrade your current device or investing for the first time, John Lewis \u0026amp Partners have the latest range of Windows laptops, whatever your need.

Black men can’t swim,” says Linford Christie. What nonsense. The 59-year-old Olympic gold medallist and former world champion is now spending 12 weeks proving himself and the stereotype wrong.Plenty of other stereotypes are overturned in the opening episode of Sink Or Swim (Channel 4). Sair Khan, a star of Coronation Street and a reality show reciist (she was on I’m a Celebrity), says people from her background don’t really swim, since the focus is putting food on the table. She probably means Muslims, not people from Weatherfield. But recall the relevant hadith: “Teach your children swimming, archery and horse riding.” Happily, Khan clocks 21 minutes over 500m, making her the fastest of the women taking part.The Last Leg presenter Alex Brooker was born with hand and arm deformities and a twisted right leg that had to be amputated when he was a baby. How does he feel in 17C water? “I’ve only got one set of toes I can’t feel.” Upbeat guy.I love his mum’s back-garden pep talk: “You were a boy, now you’re a man,” she says, while he eyes her sceptically. “Have you gone on the internet for inspirational quotes from mum to son? You’ve never said anything like that before.”I shouldn’t enjoy this show, for all that it raises money for Stand Up to Cancer. It contravenes Larry David’s rule when writing Seinfeld: no hugs, no learning. Sink Or Swim is all hugs and learning, reality TV at its most algorithmically constructed. Go-to-ad-break jeopardy? Check. Manipulative mood music when the celebrity sets out their sad backstory? Check. Christie joking about the flotation powers of his legendary lunchbox? Afraid so. But when Brooker fights off tears and pain to complete his 500m swim and collapse into Greg Rutherford’s arms, I well up like a Cumbrian rain cloud.That said, Sink Or Swim leaves questions to be answered. What happens if someone drops the baton mid-Channel? Are you allowed to swim after it and, if so, for how long before you are disqualified? After all, this is a bumbling British relay team we are talking about.The biggest question of all concerns another Towie star, Georgia Kousoulou. Payne tells her there isn’t enough time left for her to get into shape to battle the cruel sea, so Kousoulou leaves the show – even though, ironically, she is a swimwear designer. “When you really think about it,” she had said earlier, “why would I want to swim?” Quite right. Why would anyone?But doesn’t this development mean 10 will have to do the swimming of 11? If it is not too late, they should bring in a ringer, ideally the heroic teacher Sadie Davies, who just swam 15 miles from the Hartland Point in north Devon to Lundy, to raise money for the environmental charity Surfers Against Sewage. But that probably wouldn’t be fair.Next up, White Men Can Jump, in which celebrities including Stephen Fry, David Cameron, Rick Wakeman, Tony Blair, Danny Baker and Jacob Rees-Mogg raise money for charity by going to basketball camp. Twelve weeks later, they emerge with the right stuff to beat a team including LeBron James, Shaquille O’Neal and Michael Jordan.Don’t pretend you wouldn’t watch it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70a2ffbc26f5898f6e0bc117425ad70612176a71/0_182_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f0d9a2638bb24ab89b4c630b10fc0cb","title":"the great british bake off review sweet relief in these trying times","story":"From a caramel schnauzer to a blood-spattered treasure chest, here’s another scrumptious series to save us from a sugar-free life. But have we been blessed with the new Nadiya? On your marks, get set … GET HAPPY! The Great British Bake Off – the show that brought the nation together at the exact same time everything else fell in the bin like a sabotaged baked alaska – is 10 years old. To celebrate, we get … another scrumptious series of The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4). No surprises hidden like currants in a fruit cake. No crimes or misdemeanours (not yet anyway). No boat-rocking channel switches. Just some decent folk getting in a tizzy over the height of their genoise in a Berkshire tent.Let’s face it, reviewing Bake Off is now about as necessary as scoring your nan’s scones. Of course they’re going to be just right, you ungrateful wretch. Nevertheless, like those scones, Bake Off commands attention, praise, respect. And we show this recognition not by making ‘mmmm’ noises and saying ‘your best yet, nan’ but via the cooking up of vast amounts of column inches, manufactured scandals, and thinkpieces on what it really means when Paul Hollywood describes Michelle’s Fairy House showstopper as “faultless” yet doesn’t give her the handshake. Is it unconscious bias? Because it’s the first episode and he doesn’t want to peak too soon? Or has the handshake been overused to the point of redundancy and will now only be rolled out in the event of another bread lion?We will never know, but I’m racing ahead when what we’re after is a low-and-slow bake. So to the opening tableau a riff on The Wizard of Oz. Noel Fielding, droll, kind, cheeky-faced, is Dorothy. Sandy Toksvig is the scarecrow with no brain (Noel: “That’s the QI gig gone!”). Prue Leith – she of the showstopper necklaces and compassionate judging – is the lion. And Hollywood is the tin man. No heart. “Is it weird that I fancy you now?” Toksvig asks Fielding as they wander across the lawn and we wait for the theme, the aural equivalent of stepping into a warm bath, to kick in. “So do I,” mutters Hollywood. Hil. Ar. I. Ous.It’s cake week, and the signature challenge is a fruit cake, which is all about batter consistency. Too thin and the fruit drops to the bottom, too thick and … whatevs. What we’re really interested in is the texture of the contestants. Will we be blessed with a Nadiya or Rahul? Who’s going to be the anal Brendan-y one? (Henry, without a doubt: just look at his royal iced house). The posh one who induces automatic fond eye-rolls whenever they mention using pullet eggs from their own chickens? (A toss-up between vet Rosie and geography teacher Alice). The clumsy one? (Michael: he keeps cutting himself but still makes a treasure chest cake with about three fingers.) As all Bake Off fans know, the ideal contestant will be the perfect cake mix of wit, compassion, baking flair, self-deprecation, team spirit, and comedy stress responses. It’s too early to say, but I’m keeping an eye on Steph and Michelle.Much has been made of how young the group is this year, and it’s true that seven out of 13 are in their 20s. Jamie, 20, is easily the silliest. One of those inexplicable people who looks like he’s having the best time even while failing to add eggs to his caramel schnauzer. “It’s like mixing concrete,” he grins. Special mention, also, to Helena, who “lives like every day is Halloween” and makes the droopiest bat wings ever crafted out of sugar. “From one goth to another I know you’ll be fine,” Fielding reassures her. God love him, and all goths who bake. Her genoise is so rubbery, she says, that if it fell on the floor it would bounce right back. Tragically, this doesn’t happen.But her showstopper leads to the episode’s best moment. Based on the fairy garden Helena imagined as a child, she explains that she now has an actual fairy garden at home. Hollywood looks a bit smirky. Turns out he thought she said furry garden. Oooooh, naughty! “Oh Paul,” says Helena, slightly hysterical. “I know what you’re thinking.” Cue a query about how big her furry garden is, at which point I started to miss Mary Berry, because her confused-amused face would have been priceless.No matter. Bake Off remains a constant in this otherwise sugar-free life. A place where catastrophe is a dropped cake that can always be squashed back together.

In a December 2014 court filing she alleged that she was made to have sex with Andrew and other friends of Epstein.The prince has always vehemently denied the allegations. In 2015 a court decided that the allegations made by Giuffre about the prince were “immaterial and impertinent” and ordered them to be struck out of a claim against Epstein.On Tuesday, Giuffre, who now lives in Queensland with her Australian husband, spoke to reporters outside federal court in Manhattan. She was one of nearly two dozen women who spoke about alleged sexual abuse by Epstein during a unique court proceeding scheduled after the financier’s death in prison on 10 August, which was ruled a suicide.Epstein’s death at 66 brought an end to his criminal case but the judge gave accusers the opportunity to speak publicly.“He knows what he’s done and he can attest to that,” Giuffre said about Prince Andrew, a video of the press conference showed. “He knows exactly what he’s done, and I hope he comes clean about it.”Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing a number of Epstein accusers, said that “with respect to Prince Andrew or anyone else who made statements, gratuitous statements, if anyone wants to come over here and talk with us, and answer real questions that the victims have, and that we have on their behalf, we welcome that invitation.“I personally extended that invitation to Prince Andrew multiple times. Any time, we are ready, and we have a lot of questions for him.”Andrew said in a statement last Saturday that he made Epstein’s acquaintance in 1999 and saw him once or twice each year. The prince also said he stayed at several of Epstein’s homes.The prince also said: “His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.“This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein’s lifestyle. I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aeb1193a7977bdb0347db6a6b039584fdb0b4718/6_346_5382_3228/master/5382.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48a9b82c0f03eba6752101e76e7713d5","title":"new law tackle far right extremism uk tony blair thinktank","story":"Legislation would allow for hate groups to be punished before they turn to violence A new law allowing for hate groups to be designated and punished before they turn to violence is needed in order to tackle far-right extremists, according to a report by Tony Blair’s thinktank, which also seeks powers to ban marches and media appearances.Generation Identity, a racist movement that promotes a conspiracy theory that white people are being replaced by non-whites in Europe, would be among the groups targeted by new legislation, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change report said.The law could sit alongside proscription powers, banning groups concerned with terrorism, but would not be directly linked to violence or terrorism. Rather, it would designate hate groups as organisations that spread intolerance and antipathy towards people of a different race, religion, gender or nationality, the report said.Offences related to designation as a hate group should be treated as civil, not criminal, the thinktank recommends.The authors acknowledge that the issue of linking violent and nonviolent extremism is contentious and steps would need to be taken to protect free speech. The recommendations and conclusions are based on analysis of the overlap between four “nonviolent” far-right groups – Britain First, For Britain, the British National party (BNP) and Generation Identity England – and the ideology of the terrorist Anders Breivik, who murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011.Writing in a foreword, the former home secretary Jacqui Smith, the chair of the Jo Cox Foundation, said: “The growth of far-right extremist groups and the threat they pose cannot be left on the ‘too difficult’ pile.“While ad hoc action has been taken against some groups and the intelligence services are now prioritising the monitoring of far-right terrorists, we need to return to the vexed problem of how to identify the link between violent and nonviolent extremism, and develop a coherent policy approach to tackling the threat of far-right groups.”The government, public agencies and security services have taken steps to tackle far-right violence, but action against nonviolent activity has been limited and uncoordinated.In its report, Narratives of Hate: The Spectrum of Far-Right Worldviews in the UK, the thinktank found that public messages from the four activist groups in the UK had shared themes with the world view of Breivik. Victimisation, fundamental conflict between the west and Islam, anti-establishment sentiment and the justification of violence were all found in social media statements by the four UK groups and in statements by Breivik.Generation Identity and the BNP shared identical world views with Breivik on the theme of victimisation, including ideas of “white genocide” and “the great replacement” theory.The security services and the government have recognised the threat of violent and non-violent far-right extremism in the UK. MI5 took over the matter from police in 2018, meaning the far right was officially designated as a major national security threat.In 2016, the neo-Nazi group National Action became the first far-right group to be proscribed in the UK. Announcing the decision, the then home secretary, Amber Rudd, said the group was a “racist, antisemitic and homophobic organisation which stirs up hatred, glorifies violence and promotes a vile ideology”.The ban, which covers three National Action splinter groups, has resulted in several former members being put on trial. To date, National Action is the only far-right group outlawed in the UK.The Tony Blair Institute has called for a working definition of extremism, which could be used as a tool by government, law enforcement and institutions to tackle iniduals and groups that spread hateful ideas but fall short of advocating violence.It is also calling for further efforts to curb far-right hate online, including working with social media companies to define the limits of acceptable content.Azmina Siddique, a policy adviser at the institute, said: “These groups are far from innocuous. Only last month, Generation Identity England activists gathered outside the Tower of London dressed as Isis militants and simulated the beheading of two anti-racism activists. It is time that policymakers acted – by defining extremism and designating hateful groups – to stop such obviously malicious acts.”Lady Williams, the minister for countering extremism, said: “Far-right extremism has absolutely no place in our society. Our counter-terrorism and counter-extremism strategies tackle the scourge of both violent and nonviolent far-right extremism head on.“We have also established the independent commission for countering extremism, which provides advice in what is needed to tackle extremism and will be refreshing our counter-extremism strategy to ensure we keep pace with the evolving threat.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f153a88aaf7448daa58f80a867b60548a5d437f3/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d6beccde0981ddb8932eb09e6ac7230","title":"three catholic schools abandon ethos to become multi faith","story":"Primary school in Roscommon and two in Kerry to reopen as multi-denominationalThree schools in Ireland will make history this week by becoming the first to abandon their Catholic ethos and become multi-denominational state-run schools.The three small primary schools – Lecarrow in County Roscommon, and Tahilla national school and Scoil an Ghleanna, both in County Kerry – will reopen for the new term on Thursday under the umbrella of local education and training boards.They will offer a multi-belief and values programme rather than Catholic instruction. Preparation for the sacraments of communion and confirmation will take place outside school hours.The schools hope to retain and draw pupils from Ireland’s growing number of atheists, agnostics and non-Catholics. Lecarrow and Tahilla national school have just eight pupils each. Scoil an Ghleanna has 14.“We had a third of our pupils who were non-religious, so we had to look at this,” Sorcha Ni Chatháin, the principal of Scoil an Ghleanna, told RTÉ News. “We needed to look at how we were going to keep pupils, and entice others. We are a beautiful school in the most stunning location, and now we can show – formally, on paper – that we are all inclusive.”Teachers, parents andCatholic clerics endorsed the transition as essential for survival. “This is what the community wanted and I was happy to facilitate that process,” said Fr Patsy Lynch,the parish priest.Under the education and training board structures, the schools will gain more state help for staffing, IT and building maintenance.The Catholic church has previously transferred unused school buildings to multi-denominational patronage but this is said to be the first “live” transfer.The initiative by the three schools reflects a desire to stem decline in rural areas, where closed schools are a common sight. The closure of post offices, banks, police stations and pubs in villages and small towns has prompted warnings of a crisis in rural Ireland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e71db12a977df2bf5d2e6b8d77ffe67971024d0/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=551e4ff3b77c25a55e28b5ef9a550fb9","title":"russia pushing unsuitable nuclear power in africa critics claim","story":"Moscow aiming to win influence by wooing African states with nuclear energyRussia is attempting to gain influence in Africa and earn billions of pounds by selling developing nations nuclear technology that critics say is unsuitable and unlikely to benefit the continent’s poorest people.Representatives of Rosatom, the Russian state corporation responsible for both the military and civil use of nuclear energy, have approached the leaders of dozens of African countries in the past two years.The company, which is building a $29bn reactor for Egypt, has concluded agreements with Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, South Africa and others. Winners of an Africa-wide competition were rewarded with an “educational” trip to Russia that included visits to a nuclear power plant and the “science city” of Obninsk. Rosatom is among international groups that are exporting light-water technology, which is generally considered among the safest, and is building a $13bn light-water reactor in Bangladesh. But such reactors typically generate more than 1,000 megawatts and very few countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the capacity to distribute that amount of power.Nuclear power’s supporters argue that the lengthy construction times of nuclear reactors allow poorer countries to build up their infrastructure. But Névine Schepers, a nuclear expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in London, said light-water technology was not suited to many African countries.“In terms of economic sense smaller countries that have a long way to go to develop their grids would be better off aiming for something like smaller modular reactors,” she said.Technology for cheaper reactors that would produce about 300MW is being developed in Russia, China and the US.Another concern is that the expensive projects favoured by Rosatom would not benefit Africa’s poorest people. In most countries energy is generated in large, centralised plants and distributed over a national grid – a model that would be reinforced in Africa by nuclear power.“Access to energy is a basic human right and necessary for a dignified life. The majority of those denied this right live in Africa,” said Friends of the Earth. “However, the expansion of profit-driven nuclear energy in Africa would only exacerbate the problem.”The environmental NGO said the answer to Africa’s energy needs lay in “efficient technology that meets the daily needs of people, in the hands of communities and municipalities, and controlled democratically”. Only small-scale and interconnected grids that were democratically managed could deliver energy sovereignty to African people, it added.Rosatom has accused Friends of the Earth and other NGOs of “hardline anti-nuclear activism … based on a position well known for being completely biased and riddled with factual errors”. It said its priority was “sustainable development” and that nuclear energy was “intrinsically immune to any form of political manipulation”.Selling nuclear technology is part of an effort by Russia to build influence, power and trade across Africa, with growing involvement in nations across the continent.The involvement of Russian mercenaries in the Central African Republic and Sudan has attracted significant attention, as has an apparent effort to influence elections in South Africa in May.Many of the African countries that have signed commercial agreements of the kind being pursued by Rosatom are run by movements or iniduals who have long-standing relationships with Russia or – more often – the USSR.In early April João Lourenço, the president of Angola, visited Moscow for talks with Vladimir Putin and top officials, to discuss arms sales, diamond mining, and gas and oil production. Russia delivered six Su-30K fighter jets to Angola this year and two more are expected in the second part of a billion-dollar deal. Lourenç, who fought in Angola’s war of independence against Portugal, studied in Moscow from 1978 to 1982. Angola was a cold-war battleground and the USSR backed the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, still the ruling party.Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, said “reactivating old Soviet networks” had been a clear strategy in Moscow for a couple of years. “The old history can play very positively in some places.”Patrick Smith, editor of Africa Confidential, an investigative newsletter, said: “Russians can’t write big cheques but have mastered the art of making themselves really popular, albeit with some of the worst leaders in Africa. They want the ties too. The more powers they can play off against each other, the better.”The campaign has had setbacks. A deal in South Africa went wrong when Jacob Zuma was  removed from power amid corruption allegations last year. A furore surrounding a $75bn contract to build power stations with a combined 9.6 gigawatt output badly damaged the image of Russia."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3998614.1566922095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk opposition parties agree strategy to block no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has for now abandoned hopes of toppling Boris Johnson and succeeding him as a caretaker prime minister. Photograph: Isabel InfantesAFPGetty ImagesUK opposition parties agreed on Tuesday to move as early as next week to block a no-deal Brexit and prioritise using legislation to try to block prime minister Boris Johnson from leaving the EU without a deal at the end of October.After a two-hour meeting, MPs from various parties, including Labour, agreed the joint approach – leaving the alternative proposal for a vote of no confidence as a fallback “nuclear option”.The agreement means that Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has – for now – in effect abandoned hopes of toppling Mr Johnson and succeeding him as a caretaker prime minister.The Scottish National Party, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, Green Party and the Independent Group for Change joined with Labour and vowed to stop a “disastrous no-deal exit”.According to one participant at the opposition parties’ meeting, held in Mr Corbyn’s parliamentary office, those involved could try to engineer a vote in the House of Commons as early as next week. “Speed is of the essence,” he said.Separately, 160 anti-Brexit MPs on Tuesday signed the Church House Declaration – named after the building where they met – vowing to hold an alternative parliament if Mr Johnson suspends the House of Commons to force through a no-deal Brexit.In a statement, Labour insisted that the various opposition parties were still open to either a vote of no confidence or passing legislation. But other opposition MPs made clear that they preferred to use the legislative route.Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said that a vote of no confidence would be “risky”. “It could enable Boris Johnson himself to seize the moment and try to hold an election that would happen after October 31st so we could be crashing out of the EU during an election campaign,” she said.TacticsAdam Price, leader of Plaid Cymru, said the parties had agreed that a vote of no confidence was one of several issues that could be “parked ... for another day”.Other opposition figures argued that no Tory MPs would agree to hold a vote of no confidence. They fear that it could lead to a “hard left” Labour government and Mr Corbyn in Downing Street – even in a caretaker capacity ahead of an early election.The opposition MPs said they would work together to prevent Mr Johnson from suspending parliament through “prorogation” and also to try to force the House of Commons to sit during the party conference season. They agreed to set up a new contact group to work together on tactics in the coming days.The main figures working to block a no-deal Brexit include several Europhile former Conservative ministers, such as Oliver Letwin and Dominic Grieve. They have been joined in recent weeks by former ministers from the Theresa May administration, including former chancellor Philip Hammond. However no Tory MPs attended Tuesday’s meeting, with several citing diary commitments for their absence.By contrast there were several senior figures from the Labour Party, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, chief whip Nick Brown, shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer and shadow leader of the house Valerie Vaz. Opponents of a no-deal Brexit have drawn up drafts of a bill that, if passed, would force the prime minister to extend Article 50, delaying Brexit.They then have one of two options on how to push the legislation through the Commons. The first is by using a “Standing Order 24” to organise an emergency debate. The second is by trying to amend a government report due in September about efforts to restore Northern Ireland’s devolved administration at Stormont, to express MPs’ opposition to a hard Irish border in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Sir Keir, speaking earlier on the BBC’s Today programme, admitted there would have to be “give and take” if pro-EU Tory rebels were to vote in the same ision lobbies as Labour, the SNP, Liberal Democrats and other smaller parties to halt a no-deal Brexit.“We have got one week to make sure as far as possible we have a plan that is effective and we can put into action,” he said. Sir Keir added that passing a law to prevent a no-deal exit could be “direct and effective”.‘Perverse’Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson agreed that the “strongest option” would be to pass a law requiring Mr Johnson to seek an extension of the Article 50 exit process – allowing time for a second EU referendum or election. But she said any plan would have to be legally watertight so that it did not “come apart at the last minute”.Senior officials in the Johnson government described Mr Corbyn’s decision to work with other MPs to stop a no-deal Brexit as “utterly perverse”.“We are now making progress because our European partners realise we are serious about leaving the EU on October 31st, no ifs, no buts,” a No 10 aide said.“It’s utterly perverse that Corbyn and his allies are actively seeking to sabotage the UK’s position. This coalition of anti-democrats should be honest with the British public: they are against us leaving the EU no matter what. The government believes politicians don’t get to choose which public votes they respect.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It cites increasing issues surrounding boys’ appearance and body image, social media pressures, school and a lack of strong friendships as potential driving factors for plummeting happiness levels.Mark Russell, chief executive at The Children’s Society said: “Modern childhood is a happy and carefree time for most, yet for too many it is not. It is a national scandal that children’s unhappiness is increasing so quickly.  “Today’s young people are becoming progressively unhappy with their friendships – one of the fundamental building blocks of well-being – as well as appearance and school. We also know that excessive social media use is a factor linked to children’s low well-being.“Children are also burdened with fears ranging from worrying about the future, not having enough money to not feeling safe at school and bullying. Many young people tell us they feel side-lined and ignored by those in power.”UK trends in children’s happiness with different aspects of lifeThe charity is urging the Government to introduce a national measurement of children’s well-being which experts can respond to. His comments come as the Government is currently drawing up legislation which will impose a statutory duty of care on tech companies - enforced by an independent regulator - following the The ’s successful Duty of Care campaign.However this year researchers have found that children are the unhappiest they have been for almost a quarter-of-a-century.Over the past eight years there has been a significant decrease in happiness with life as a whole among more than 2,000 10-15-year-olds.According to the latest available data, in 201617, on a scale of one to ten, the mean happiness level among children was 7.89.This figure has not been this low since records began in 1995. The last time it was so low was in 1996 when the mean happiness for life as a whole among children equated to 8.0.Over the past eight years, researchers specifically noted a significant and specific fall in children’s happiness with their friends. Between 2009-10 the mean happiness rate for friendships was 8.99. By 2012-13, this had dropped to 8.78. For every year since 1996 - which saw a record low of 8.51 - children have been happier with their friendships. However by 20162017 the mean figure for children’s happiness with their friends has fallen to 8.70.Duty of Care white paperExperts said 2.8 per cent of children are unhappy with their friends and that “the wider research suggests that this could be down to factors as varied as bullying, being unable to spend time with friends outside of school, excessive social media use and loneliness”.Researchers also found that nearly one in 12 boys (7.7 per cent)– the equivalent of 180,000 – are unhappy with their appearance. Over 13s were significantly less happy with how they look compared to 10-12 year-olds. Historically, boys have been happier with their appearance than girls however the new data suggests that the gap is narrowing.  One boy who submitted his answers to the survey said “Like Instagram and stuff, right? You see all these models, you see all these weightlifters, body-builders and you look at yourself and you’re like – I look like a stick. I feel like we’re exposed to a lot more so we are less secure about our appearance.”Duty of Care campaign | Read moreTom Madders, Campaigns Director at YoungMinds, the children’s mental health charity, described the declining trend in happiness and friendships as “worrying”.“The reasons behind these trends are complex and multiple,” he said. “We do know that young people today can face a wide range of pressures, including stress at school, problems with friendships, bullying and concerns around body image, which can all have a huge impact on a young person’s mental health.” He added that difficult experiences in childhood including neglect, bereavement or growing up in poverty can also have a lasting effect.A Department for Education spokesman said: “We want young people growing up in a modern Britain to feel confident tackling the challenges life throws at them. That is why we’re giving teachers the power to deal with bad behaviour and bullying in the classroom, investing billions every year in mental health support for young people, and providing quicker access to specialist treatment where needed. Through our new compulsory health education, pupils will be taught how to recognise the signs of poor mental health and how to stay safe online.  “We’re also giving young people a voice on the issues they care about, such as the environment, climate change and crime or violence, through the Youth Charter currently in development.”Duty of Care CampaignDepartment for EducationShoppers are being ripped off by supermarkets with misleading offers, despite government crackdown Which? findsVaping ad banned for using \u0026#39bald head and eyebrows\u0026#39 suggesting Sir Mo Farah endorsed product, watchdog rulesHumanitarian aid can be used to open up markets for UK companies, says International Development SecretaryComment: Next week\u0026#39s Spending Round will clear decks to let us focus on BrexitSajid Javid warns there will be no blank cheques for Government departments in lead up to BrexitFirst British woman tells court of her abuse at the hands of Jeffrey EpsteinThirteen metal detectorists rushed to hospital after chocolate birthday cake handed out at convention is spiked with cannabis oilBoris Johnson risks clash with Brexiteers if he only secures concessions from EU on the Irish backstopGreat British Bake Off: youngest contestants in show\u0026#39s history turn to mum and dad for recipe helpThe Great British Bake Off 2019, episode 1 review: series 10 kicks off with soggybottoms, sliced fingers and middle-class madnessComment: Britain will be better off as a junior partner of the United States than an EU vassalPhilip Hammond is preparing to spearhead efforts to block a no-deal BrexitFestival-goers should pay £25 fee which is withheld if tent is abandoned, campaign group says Lip-reading CCTV will have people \u0026#39cupping hands over their mouths\u0026#39 in street, warns surveillance watchdogComment: Iran\u0026#39s belligerence towards Israel is more likely to provoke war than a rapprochement with TrumpBolsonaro says Macron must take back \u0026#39insults\u0026#39 for Brazil to accept G7 Amazon aidComment: Cricket bosses are squandering a golden chance to entice the next generation\tCyber attack on NHS would trigger full Nato response, says alliance\u0026#39s general secretaryComment: This so-called People\u0026#39s Parliament is nothing more than an anti-democratic coupWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/08/26/TELEMMGLPICT000207342971_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq-rliM5zHz0XWvGpEs52xCXzYxy3cFh7YvYpmjsGRqOA.jpeg?imwidth=","title":"cricket bosses squandering golden chance entice next generation","story":"Where will the next Ben Stokes come from with grassroots cricket under threat?Nobody knows the first thing about prejudice, wrote Paul Johnson, unless they are a red-haired, left-handed Catholic.

It’s going to be fine.” He went on to slice his finger three times during filming, requiring large plasters.The weekly showstopper challenge saw contestants asked to create the cake of their childhood dreams, with fairy gardens, toadstool houses, pirate islands and purple carousels from the younger bakers and a “retro” rocket from veteran of the group Phil, 56. Despite their difficulties, the bakers appeared to have impressed the judges. Hollywood said: “Every year of Bake Off, the standard has got better and better and better, and I expect this year to be just the same.”Evicted from the tent was 33-year-old support worker Dan, who said his wife had helped him practice along with his “amazing” parents.  “I am not going to miss the baking under pressure,” he said. “I’m just going to miss everyone in that tent.”The Great British Bake Off will be on Channel 4 at 8pm on Tuesdays.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Tonight, the 10th series of the baking competition kicked\u0026nbspoff on Channel 4 (its third year on the network, after it controversially outbid the BBC). One particularly\u0026nbsphysterical tabloid headline predicted that\u0026nbspit was going to be filled with filthy innuendos and a simulated sex act. But to be honest, all things considered, it was fairly low in\u0026nbspdouble-entendres.\u0026nbspJudges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood reprised their roles, as did hosts Noel Fielding and Sandi Toksvig.Just for fun, and with absolutely nothing to go on except their photos and a short bio, I predicted that this year\u0027s winner will be\u0026nbspMichael. And he\u0027s still going strong(ish).Here are the talking points from tonight\u0027s episode.\u0026nbspIt looked certain that Jamie –\u0026nbsp poor little Jamie, so young his voice broke midway through the episode – would be leaving, but it all boiled down to Dan’s terrible signature bake. Now Jamie has the chance to “prove to people I can actually bake”. Maybe he could tag team in with his twin and give it another shot?\u0026nbsp“I’m just so proud,” said the print shop administrator, whose carrot cake was “possible the best cake” Prue has ever eaten. Though I’m fairly sure Prue has said that too many times to be taken completely seriously.\u0026nbspIt’s one of the youngest years everThere is barely a grey hair in sight this year. The 28-year-olds are veritable veterans. But the very youngest contestants, who were barely into double figures when Bake Off began, have\u0026nbspproven themselves. Well, sort of. 20-year-old Jamie struggled, coming\u0026nbsplast in the technical challenge, and having to start\u0026nbspagain in the showstopper, but he managed to scrape through. And Henry, who’s also 20, is sailing ahead. The children are the futureBake Off has always been a show laden with double-entendres, but it is my belief that Paul should be banned from participating in them. Particularly when they’re directed at women. After becoming confused by Helena’s accent and thinking she was making a “furry garden” instead of a fairy garden, he then asked, a glint in his cold, blue eye, “So how big is your, er, FAIRY garden?” No. Fire him.\u0026nbspNerves get the better of everyoneWeek one is always the most nerve-wracking. It’s a wonder the contestants don’t collapse into a heap in the corner andor run off into the woods to start\u0026nbspa new life. “I can’t do it.” “The worst has happened,” and “I’ve dropped it,” are just three of the sentences uttered tonight. There was a dropped cake, a collapsed house, missing eggs…. Pull yourselves together, bakers.\u0026nbspNo one should ever try and make caramel.\u0026nbspIt crystallises. It does. It just does.\u0026nbspRemind yourself of this year\u0027s contestants and follow along with all the action from the tent live below:Meet the new Great British Bake Off contestantsPrue Leith opens up about sexist former head chef at SavoyHow to make chocolate crumpets from The Great Celebrity Bake OffPlease allow the live blog a moment to loadThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That is the highest number since February 2017.\u0026nbsp“It is possible that mortgage activity is being lifted by some people looking to complete their house purchases before Brexit occurs on 31 October, given the major uncertainties surrounding the UK successfully leaving the EU with a deal,” commented Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.Data from Rightmove released last week supports this interpretation. House sales jumped 6.1 per cent over the month to 10 August compared with a year ago. Rightmove attributed the unexpected increase to the looming Brexit deadline and lower house prices.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move,” said Miles Shipside, housing market analyst at the company.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Growth in net credit card spending slowed for the third consecutive month. The net amount – which is the\u0026nbspdifference between spending and repayments, adjusted for factors\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbsppopulation changes and write-offs –\u0026nbsprose by £49m, the weakest increase this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

We’re talking here about a picturesque and historic walled town in the middle of a region that attracts a large number of visitors.You’re not going to be able to replicate what it has across Britain. \u0026nbspBut here’s the thing: similarly\u0026nbsptouristy places\u0026nbspon this side of the channel are struggling in a way that Dinan at least doesn’t appear to be.Nationally, the British Retail Consortium puts the vacancy rate at 10.3 per cent. Footfall declined by 1.9 per cent in July.\u0026nbspIt isn’t just economically deprived areas that are struggling either. Last year it was reported that there were 42 vacant premises in the picturesque city of Bath, for example. It’s a good deal bigger than Dinan, but is a similar tourist trap thanks to the world-famous Roman baths, which have given the city the status of a Unesco\u0026nbspworld heritage site and put it high on the itinerary of visitors to the region.\u0026nbspCampaigner Luke John Emmett successfully drew attention to the city centre’s plight with the aid of a camera. He says while landlords have made efforts to make some of the empty premises look less unsightly since then, and new tenants are promised, the problem continues.\u0026nbspAs retailers continue to close stores, the issue of empty shopfronts looks set to continue to plague the British high street.\u0026nbspSo to Dinan. What made mooching around the place such a pleasure was the sheer variety of what this small town had to offer.\u0026nbspOf course we saw places catering for the tourist euro, but there were also bookshops, a toyshop, bakeries, a place where a bloke was selling lights built out of scrap, an indoor market.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Somehow Dinan has become Breton geek central. We even found a steampunk and Harry Potter emporium.Add in the inevitable profusion of cafes, something France does so very well, and you’ve an enticing mix.\u0026nbspThe lack of the chains that have homogenised British shopping centres, and made them boring, was a big plus point for me. It’s not that they aren’t there. There was, of course, a Carrefour convenience outlet, broadly equivalent to Tesco . There was also a bookie, in the form of a PMU bar. But they weren’t dominant features in\u0026nbspthe same way that they are in Britain.\u0026nbspThe retreat of the chains could provide an opportunity for small and more specialist outlets to move in, especially in places like Bath which have a ready supply of visitors.But, of course, there are high rents to contend with and the running sore of business rates linked to property values that are far\u0026nbsphigher in town centres than they are on the outskirts where internet retailers like Amazon build their warehouses.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Would you risk setting up a shop in the current climate when you’d be better off selling online from your garage if retail is your thing?Some imagination is called for, and from local as well as central government. Mr\u0026nbspEmmett thinks encouraging pop-up shops could help. That’s an idea that could have legs. A fresh\u0026nbspset of shops every week? People might just be moved to take a trip to check out the week’s new arrivals if there were to be a variety of places cycling through.\u0026nbspWhat Britain’s walking dead town centres are in dire need of is what Dinan obviously has in abundance: life. It would certainly help if the nation could find a government willing and able to breathe it in.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

That is the highest number since February 2017.\u0026nbsp“It is possible that mortgage activity is being lifted by some people looking to complete their house purchases before Brexit occurs on 31 October, given the major uncertainties surrounding the UK successfully leaving the EU with a deal,” commented Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY ITEM Club.Data from Rightmove released last week supports this interpretation. House sales jumped 6.1 per cent over the month to 10 August compared with a year ago. Rightmove attributed the unexpected increase to the looming Brexit deadline and lower house prices.\u0026nbsp“There’s only so long that buyers and sellers can delay the familial, financial and emotional forces driving the need to move,” said Miles Shipside, housing market analyst at the company.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Growth in net credit card spending slowed for the third consecutive month. The net amount – which is the\u0026nbspdifference between spending and repayments, adjusted for factors\u0026nbspsuch as\u0026nbsppopulation changes and write-offs –\u0026nbsprose by £49m, the weakest increase this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The rest wanted to move into the UK but changed their plans due to Brexit.\u0026nbspAnother 325 firms are thinking of setting up in the Netherlands for the same reason, the representative\u0026nbspsaid. Both sets of businesses include British firms as well as those from North America, Asia and Australia.“Brexit undeniably has economic implications for international businesses because they do business everywhere in Europe,” said Jeroen Nijland, NFIA commissioner.\u0026nbsp“The ongoing growing uncertainty in the United Kingdom, and the increasingly clearer possibility of a no deal, is causing major economic unrest for these companies. That is why more and more companies are orienting themselves in the Netherlands as a potential new base in the European market.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

Philip Morris has been ploughing billions of dollars in promoting IQOS, a heat-not-burn product used by millions consumers outside the US. Altria meanwhile has invested $12.8 billion in e-cigarette upstart Juul Labs Inc., which has catapulted itself to the US industry leader in smoking alternatives in just a few years.Altria also has been planning to start selling IQOS in the U.S. this year, testing out demand in the Atlanta area with a store opening next month.Philip Morris said in a statement that no agreement has been formally reached and any deal would be subject to board, shareholder and regulatory approval.

On the filters page, scroll to the end, tap Manage, then drag and drop the ones you want to reorder, and un-check the ones you want to hide. Instagram controversially ditched its reverse-chronological order feed for a new order determined by an algorithm, making it easy to completely miss some posts. To make sure you never miss a certain somebody’s updates, you can set up notification for them by visiting their profile, tapping the three dots in the top right-hand corner and selecting Turn On Post Notifications.If you’re worried about how much of your mobile data Instagram saps, you can limit it by sacrificing the speed at which the photos and videos in your feed load.

NatWest had been hit by 25 different outages 12-months to the end of June, it said.Both banks\u0027 websites are completely broken, meaning that even navigating to the homepage will not work. As well as stopping people from being able to login through the website, it means that all information stored on those pages is unavailable.“We are aware that customers are currently experiencing issues accessing our websites and online banking login pages, an RBS spokesperson said.\u0026nbspWe apologise for the inconvenience caused.We are aware of the problem and are working hard to fix it. Customers can still access Online Banking via direct links, they can use their mobile app, ATMs, telephone banking, or visit their local branch.”New NatWest bank cards allow people to pay with fingerprintThe banks did however suggest that their apps are still working as normal, and that customers with pressing issues could message the bank through that for more help.They did say however that the problems mean that there may be a delay in hearing back.Customer support wait times may be longer than usual, NatWest warned on Twitter.

With them sit a pair of slippers\u0026nbspand a straw hat – items to prepare the 85-year-old Zimbabwean native\u0026nbspfor the unpredictable British weather. Little did she know that a month later they would be gathering dust.The 60-year-old care home worker, who moved to Britain in 1999, had been looking forward to her father’s visit for months. Paul Tipa, an agriculture worker, has never left landlocked Zimbabwe, so it would be a chance to not only show him around London, but to take him to the seaside for the first time. Plus, he would be able to meet his\u0026nbspthree-year-old,\u0026nbspBritish-born\u0026nbspgreat granddaughter, Ariella.Tipa, 85, had been looking forward to visiting his daughter Celia in the UK for the first timeCeclia\u0026nbspsays she had ‘everything lined up’ for her father’s visit, including clothing, slippers and toiletries“I feel it’s so unfair. I felt part of the country, part of the culture. But this really proved to me that I don’t belong. I feel like an outsider,” says Cecilia.\u0026nbsp”I have worked so hard, contributed. I am law abiding. I just want him to come this one time. Now I’m going to work and I’m thinking, why am I doing this?“He is my father. He is the one who gave me the opportunity to be doing what I’m doing here. So he should have the right to visit me. He has no reason to overstay, especially in the cold here. He doesn’t like to be cold.Ariella\u0026nbsp(left), for the first time”Caring for elderly patients every day, other elderly fathers, and I am denied the right to see my own.”Cecilia is one of many African nationals who have lived and worked in the UK for decades, yet have been denied the right to have their elderly relatives visit them on the grounds that their family members do not have sufficient income in their home country.African people twice as likely to be refused UK visas, finds reportLawyers say\u0026nbspthese refusals amount to a “misapplication” of the immigration rules and are\u0026nbsppotentially unlawful, as the applicant’s own financial circumstances should be “entirely irrelevant” if a third party – such as their offspring in the UK – has proven they can fund their visit. They also argue that citing their income and background in this way is a form of racism.It comes amid existing concern about\u0026nbspracial bias in the visa system, after a report last month found that African people were more than twice as likely to be refused a UK visa as applicants from other parts of the world.In another case, Zimbabwean national Spiwe Jaji, 49, who was granted refugee status after coming to the UK in 2002, and has since worked as a healthcare assistant and now a nurse, says she feels\u0026nbsp“betrayed” by the UK after the Home Office refused her mother’s visit visa for a similar reason.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Since her father past away three years ago, she has longed for her mother, 74-year-old Rettia Jaji, a farmer, to spend some time with her in England. \u0026nbsp“When I do go home I’m just rushing around seeing relatives. I don’t have time to stay with my mum properly. When my dad passed away I didn’t even have time to get closure,” says Spiwe.“My mum wouldn’t even want to stay for the full six months of the visa, let alone stay longer than that. She has got livestock. She has been in that village or more than 50 years. How can she abandon it? She goes to see her husband’s grave every day.passsed away three years ago, she has longed for her mother, 74-year-old Rettia Jaji, a farmer, to spend some time with her in England (Spiwe Jaji)“I look after older people in this country with compassion and love. I see old ladies like my mum every day and take good care of them. But they won’t allow me to have my mum come and just stay with me for even just one or two months.“It feels like they are racially discriminating against Africans. I don’t think they are even assessing our applications, just denying them.”In a third case, London-based Nigerian national Elizabeth Ezeronye, who has been living and working in the UK for more than a decade and has British citizenship, says she feels\u0026nbsp“let down” by the UK government after her 64-year-old mother, Regina Chukwu, was denied a visit visa.Ezeronye and her husband Okezie, who both work with vulnerable people, were disappointed when the Home Office rejected Regina’s visa application to see her grandson for the first timeThe 34 year old, who works as a team leader in a care home, and whose husband Okezie is a support worker for vulnerable adults, says she wanted her mother to meet her eight-month-old baby, Charles, for the first time and help her to care for the child during the remainder of her maternity leave.Describing the moment she saw the refusal letter, she says: “I cried. We had provided a letter saying we have a two-bedroom flat and that she was going to stay with us. All the bank statements, pay slips, to prove it. It feels like they didn’t look at any of those documents.“I work with vulnerable people, and the one thing we ask for, for my mum to visit, on all our expenses. Is it because she’s an African? Because she’s Nigerian? I don’t know. It feels racist and unjust.“I treat vulnerable people everyday. It is my passion. I give back to the system. I have been loyal to the country, a law-abiding citizen,\u0026nbspBut when I ask them for one thing, for my mum to come visit, it is refused.”Elizabeth says she wishes\u0026nbspto challenge the decision, but that she couldn’t afford to pay a solicitor, adding: “Now that I’ve got my bundle of joy, they treat me this way.”Human rights barrister Jan Doerfel said\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspsuch cases are “not uncommon”, and accused\u0026nbspthe Home Office “systematically misapplying the rules and rendering them more restrictive”, which\u0026nbsphe said in turn undermined\u0026nbspthe rule of law\u0026nbspand constituted\u0026nbspracism.Mother blocked from attending daughter’s graduation“When there is a reason for a visit and there are finances available, then a visa should be granted. But they’re saying you are too poor to intend to return. And that is racism,” he says. “It directly discriminates on the basis of income, and it indirectly discriminates on the basis of country or origin, which amounts to racism.“Income should be irrelevant when you’ve got someone paying for your trip. It’s not in the immigration rules that if you earn less than ‘X’ you can be refused.“It stems out of the hostile environment. We used to call it a \u0027culture of disbelief\u0027, but I think it’s a refusal culture, because it’s not that they don’t believe it.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “All cases are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the immigration rules.“We are clear that applicants must be able to maintain and accommodate themselves during their visit without working, and prove that they have a genuine intention to leave the UK.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Despite a warning from Dominic Cummings, his top adviser, not to get carried away by positive talk from Angela Merkel, many Downing Street officials are convinced that there are signs the EU side is prepared to shift its ground.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson in his news conference at the end of the G7 summit said he was “marginally more optimistic” that a Brexit deal could be done that would avoid a no-deal exit on 31 October.\u0026nbspAnd a No 10 spokesperson told journalists yesterday: “What is clear is that if there is goodwill on both sides, and a determination to get things done, solutions to the backstop exist and the prime minister believes they should be discussed.”She was pressed on whether a change to the backstop – the\u0026nbspfall-back arrangements to keep the Irish border open – would be sufficient, and said: “We have been clear the changes we are seeking relate to the backstop.”This could go down badly with several Eurosceptic Tory MPs, who have warned that simply dropping the backstop would not be enough. Iain Duncan Smith, David Davis, John Redwood, Steve Baker and Mark Francois have all said the backstop is not the only thing that makes the withdrawal agreement unacceptable. They complain about the orce bill, the transition period and the persistence of EU law (because some citizenship issues have an eight-year phase-out).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Biggest lies told by Boris Johnson Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.15 Made-up quote for The TimesJohnson was sacked from The Times newspaper in the late 1980s after he fabricated a quote from his godfather, the historian Colin Lucas, for a front-page article about the discovery of Edward II’s Rose Palace. “The trouble was that somewhere in my copy I managed to attribute to Colin the view that Edward II and Piers Gaveston would have been cavorting together in the Rose Palace,” he claimed.25 Sacked from cabinet over cheating lieMichael Howard gave Boris Johnson two new jobs after becoming leader of the Conservatives in 2003 – party vice-chairman and shadow arts minister.35 Broken promise to bossIn 1999 Johnson was offered editorship of The Spectator by owner Conrad Black on the condition that he would not stand as an MP while in the post.

The Vote Leave campaign also produced a poster reading: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU”On the other hand, Duncan Smith and Davis voted for Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement, along with Johnson, on the third time it was put to the Commons, in March. So I suspect they would in the end vote for a “better” agreement if Johnson asked them nicely.\u0026nbspWe would then be back to the nail-biting numbers game that dominated parliament early this year. In the end 28 Eurosceptic Tory MPs voted against May’s deal, and she was 30 votes short of the total she needed to get the deal through. Johnson has appointed four of the 28, including Priti Patel, to government jobs, and may be able to persuade a handful more.\u0026nbspHow the Brexit tribes are preparing the blame game ahead of no-dealBut Redwood, Baker and others are never going to vote for a deal, so the prime minister would be left needing about another 20 votes. If he can get changes to the backstop that are acceptable to the DUP, its 10 MPs would take him half way to the target.\u0026nbspThen\u0026nbsphe would still need 10 more votes from Labour MPs – such as Sarah Champion, who says she is prepared to leave the EU without a deal, and Stephen Kinnock, who now seems to regret not having voted for May’s deal.\u0026nbspJohnson said yesterday the chances of doing a deal were “touch and go”. Even if he succeeds, the same phrase describes his chances of getting it through parliament.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Prime Minister is reportedly planning to suspend parliament to force through a No Deal crash out. This action would be, according to legal advice I\u0027ve received from Shadow Attorney General Shami Chakrabarti, the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK constitutional principle in living memory.My view is that holding a general election after an extension is achieved is the simplest and most democratic way to prevent No Deal and to let the people of this country decide our future. Indeed, it is the best route to a referendum or leaving the EU with a deal.I understand not all colleagues may agree.So I would like to invite you to join a dialogue with myself, as leader of the Labour Party, and other opposition parties, to find a way for the clear will of parliament against No Deal to express itself.Please respond by email.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

From next June, only those over-s on pension credit will be eligible for free TV licences — just one in five people.That means .million pensioners, including more than , service veterans, will have to find £. a yearthey want to continue watching television.To add insult to injury, the BBC then disclosed how much money it is paying its stars.Anti-Brexit activist and Match Of The Day presenter Gary Lineker is on £,,, Graham Norton is on £, and Claudia Winkleman is on £,.Lineker’s salary alone would pay for more than , TV licences.Asthat wasn’t bad enough, earlier this month the Beeb said it intends to spend £million on an advertising campaign to attract young viewers and listeners.That’s more than the annual budget of Radio .It’s particularly high, given that the BBC can advertise on its own TV channels and radio stations for free. Apparently, the money is going to be spent on targeting young people on social media.Are we really supposed to believe that the BBC cannot afford to pay for pensioners’ TV licences, but can fritter away £million on Facebook adverts There’s almost nothing Auntie won’t stoop to in its desperate pursuit of the “yoof” audience.It has earmarked £million to promote its new Sounds app — including spending £, to transform the London Eye into the “London Ear” — and poured money into a series of increasingly tawdry podcasts, such as Gemma Collins talking about her le, a reality-show round-up called Reality Tea, and Unexpected Fluids, in which teenagers tell embarrassing ­stories about when sex goes wrong.It’s all a far cry from Lord Reith’s mission to explain.No doubt the BBC is concerned about how few young people it manages to attract — and this manests itself in other ways, too, such as its massive investment in apps and podcasts and its extensive online coverage of ITV’s Love Island.Last year, Ofcom revealed that  to -year-olds are spending an average of an hour and  minutes per day consuming BBC content, which is about half the amount for all age groups.Even more worrying for the Corporation, one in eight young Brits consumes no BBC content at all. Why should they fork out £. for the licence fee, particularly as many of them will already be paying for subscription TV services The fundamental problem the Beeb faces is that consumers are becomingly increasingly accustomed to paying for the TV content they want to watch and resent having to pay a mandatory flat tax to a single provider.The equivalent would beeveryone who owns a phone, tablet or laptop had to pay £. for an “internet licence” to fund Apple’s iTunes, regardless of whether or not they use the service.It’s time to do away with the licence fee — for everyone, not just the over-s.That would mean stripping down the state-funded parts of the BBC to its core news and current affairs output and funding that out of general taxation.It should sell off its profitable private isions — such as BBC Studios, which has annual revenues of more than £billion — and plough the money into creating its own subscription service.With its global brand recognition and unrivalled back catalogue, not to mention its reputation for high-quality drama, the BBC could easily compete with commercial providers such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.Promising to scrap the licence fee would surely be a vote-winner for Boris Johnson.No s, no buts. When it comes to renewing the BBC’s Royal Charter, it’s time to say: “No deal.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m a big girl now which means I get to to wear my unorm.”She is waiting to have a gastronomy implant and still struggles to gain weight.At .kg she weighs around kg ess than the average girl of her age, but mum Shannon said her little angel is perfect.Miya was born on August ,  weighing just under lb lb oz.Most babies born between  and  weeks weigh somewhere between  pounds,  ouncesand  pounds,  ounces .Shannon said: “From about  weeks into my pregnancy doctors noticed that she wasn’t growing properly and that my placenta was not working as it should be.“I had a cesarean at  weeks and it was horrible, it was such a shock you don’t think anything that small could survive. She was in Bristol hospital for seven weeks, they gave me and my partner Luke a room next door to her incubator so we could go in and see her whenever we wanted.“She didn’t come out of the incubator and was ventilated for the first  days of her le, the nurses told me she had a  per cent chance of survival. We didn’t knowshe was going to make it or not. We all just took it one day at a time.“She was wrapped up in a little plastic bag to keep her warm and there were wires and tubes attached to monitors everywhere. It was crazy.“It was so frightening, I remember saying to the doctors I don’t want to hold her. I was so scared of accidentally hurting her.“We were able to put our hands in the incubator the day after she was born. We were not allowed to stroke her but could put a finger on her hand or on her foot.“I first held her when she was three weeks old and then at four weeks Luke held her for the first time.“Every day you could see how she was getting better and better and growing. I loved going in to see her every day to see how dferent she would look.”After she was born on  August , Miya was finally allowed home to Wellington, Somerset, just in time for Christmas on  December.But on Boxing Day the baby girl stopped breathing and spent a further two weeks in Bristol children’s hospital.Slowly she began getting better but regularly used oxygen until she was two.Shannon added: “She was then transferred to Taunton hospital where she was for nine weeks.“Her due date was the rd December and she eventually came home for the first time on  December.“She was in hospital for  weeks in total. The doctors and nurses had her on oxygen the whole time as well as a feeding tube down her nose.“Just eight days after she came home she stopped breathing and we had to rush her to Bristol children’s hospital. She was then back in hospital for another two weeks.“Miya had to use oxygen at home in her day-to-day le until she was two. She was in and out of hospital all the time as they tried to wean her body off the oxygen.“It was so hard for all of us. We were really lucky that we had so much support from both our families, the whole time we were in hospital we had visitors every day.“The entire experience was just surreal, we just used to think ‘how is this happening ’. But we were always so glad to see her growing, she just did so well.“Miya is still really small, she has struggled to gain weight and she is now going to have a gastronomy fitted which we are waiting for. She is tiny compared to other kids her age, but she is such a strong brave little girl.“She does not think she is any dferent, Miya is determined that nothing will get the better of her.”"},{"url":null,"title":"indonesia jakarta capital city borneo","story":"The decision comes as the current capital, which is home to more than million people, is sinking into the ground as nearly half of the city already sits below sea level.President Joko Widodo said three years of intense study saw officials identy the future capital which sits on the eastern side of the island as the ideal location.The island is the third largest in the world and is at the centre of the archipelago nation, with the move expected to take up to  years and cost £.billion.The site of the new capital, ,miles northeast of Jakarta, is one of the regions least prone to the natural disasters that regularly hit the archipelago of , islands.Most of the move will be funded by cooperation between the government and businesses and by direct investment by state-run firms.Around  per cent will come from the governments budget.The new city will sit in between two undeveloped regions of Kutai Kertanegara and Penajam Paser Utara.In a televised speech, the Indonesian president said: The location is very strategic - its in the centre of Indonesia and close to urban areas.The burden Jakarta is holding right now is too heavy as the centre of governance, business, finance, trade and services.He also added the city already has a relatively complete infrastructure with it being near the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda.The new city is said to be atminimal risk of natural disasters.In a televised speech, Widodo said the burden on Jakarta had become too much, with it being home to the government, the countrys largest seaport and airport, and the centre for finance, trade and business.The decision to relocate the countrys capital city was because the government wants to spread the countrys wealth and population.Currently,  per cent of the countrys  million population live on Java, making it the most populated area in Indonesia.Widodo added: We couldnt continue to allow the burden on Jakarta and Java island to increase in terms of population density.Economic disparities between Java and where would also increase.Officials say they want the new capital to be “a smart city in the forest” and have set aside , acres of government land.Jakarta is sinking due to rising sea levels and the over-extraction of groundwater.More than  per cent of Jakartas resident use groundwater.This consequently makes floods worse as floodwater is unable to flow into the ocean.The city is sinking by an average of in a year and almost half the city now sits below sea level.Greenpeace senior forest campaigner Jasmine Puteri said: “The move will have an environmental impact.“Jakarta has suffered so many failures from pollution, water crisis, and flooding.

They seem to think it a great benefit to the country when conducted with the EU, but a route to national disastercarried out with any other country.The charge that anyone will be forced to eat chlorinated chicken or GM foods is, needless to say, a far bigger porky pie than anything Boris has said on the subject.It is far from certain that a Johnson Government, when engaged in trade talks with the US, will make the concessions allowing these products into UK markets, butit does, then UK shoppers will continue to have a choice.They will still be able to buy chicken produced in Britain or the EU, or they will be able to choose to eat American chicken.I certainly have no fear of eating chicken which has been washed in chlorine. The idea that it is “dangerous” has been thoroughly debunked. Each of us ingests far more chlorine through drinking water than we ever would do through eating US-produced chicken.As for GM foods, we already eat them, vegans especially. The EU allows imports of GM soyafor simple practical reasons. Most of it is grown in the Americas and too many growers there use GM seed for non-GM soya to be sold as a separate product.If we want free trade we are not going to achieve it just by persuading other countries to open their markets to us. No, we will have to make the concession of opening our markets to them too. But there is no reason to be frightened.True, there are some products which need to be banned from sale for genuine health and safety reasons. But most of the EU’s food product standards are really just a form of protectionism in disguise, dreamed up to block competition for European farmers.If we do post-Brexit trade deals with the US and other countries — and in the process do away with the EU’s protectionist tarfs and product standards — some UK producers would suffer.But others would prosper as they enjoyed access to new export markets. Overall, as is almost always the case when trade barriers are taken down, we would benefit. Strong industries would grow and consumers would enjoy greater choice and lower prices.Boris’s vision of a global British pork pie industry shows the dference between him and the political opponents who spent much of yesterday scheming over how to stop him taking Britain out of the EU.While his glass is half full, theirs is half empty.They are driven by a pathological fear of le outside the EU.It is not that they have any great enthusiasm for the EU. After all, I haven’t heard one of them make a convincing case why the EU is an institution to be admired. It is just that they have a lack of ambition for Britain and so cling to EU membership.After meeting for several hours yesterday, what did the likes of Jeremy Corbyn, Keir Starmer and Jo Swinson come up with That they want to extend Article  yet further, to prolong yet again the endless drt which unsettled markets and put off investment.Fortunately, the public seems to have come to a very dferent conclusion.

Miss de Georgiou joined  other women to address the court on Tuesday in an emotional, passionate and at times furious retelling of their stories, as the case against the late financier was formally closed.    As an actress she had a role in the  Hollywood war film “ and a Wake-Up,” starring Faye Dunaway.

The -year-old, who has not been named, was released on bail after the short hearing at court in Cyprus this morning. A preliminary trial date has been set for October , according to Cypriot media. In July the teenager initially told police she had been gang-raped by a group of Israeli tourists - who were arrested - but later retracted the claim. The Israelis were then released without charge. However Justice Abroad, who are assisting the woman, claim she was given undue pressure by Cypriot Police to retract her allegations. They say she was subjected to an eight-hour interrogation at a police station without a lawyer in contravention of Cypriot Constitutional Law and European Union provisions.

Rhys Manderson was driving on north Hull when he saw a woman running out of a house filled with black smoke and then tripping over.The -year-old slammed on his brakes, rang  and then heard the woman scream that her little girl was trapped in the burning property, reports Hull Live.Mr Manderson ran inside to try and save the child.    I covered my mouth with my coat and tried to run up the stairs to rescue the four-year-old girl that I was told was trapped in her bedroom, he said. As soon as I hit the top of the stairs the intensity and heat and pressure struck me - I didnapost realise how bad it would be and I breathed in a lot of the smoke up there. I broke the windows but couldnapost see the girl and ran out again as I think the mum had given me the wrong room in all the panic, as when I came back out she said her daughter was actually in the back bedroom.    I had about two or three goes at saving her and screaming for her and was panicking myself by then and ran around the back and smashed the window with a shovel. I was hanging off the ledge at one point trying to get her out and thought to myself aposthis is really bad and Iaposm not sure weaposre going to get to herapos. Then the firefighters arrived and barged the door down and saved her and were in and out by the time I dropped back to the ground. Smoke was constantly billowing from the house and the outside was completely black with soot as horried neighbours looked on, with Mr Manderson unable to get to the girl because the smoke was too thick. The experience was a scary one for him, but his only concern at the time was for the little girl. It was real scary at the time. At first I thought I was invincible and that I would be fine by covering my mouth with a coat. I also used to be a swimmer so thought I could hold my breath for at least two and a half minutes, but the pressure of the smoke and heat forced me to breathe. My leg hair was singed with the heat and I was in there for three or four minutes and the fire was just getting worse - all I could hope was that the girl would be okay.  In my head, I was sure anyone would try and rescue someone in that situation, or at least attempt to do it, but there were lots of people just stood about watching, perhaps in shock. I was so relieved when she was saved and Iaposm so happy she got out and that the family are now recovering and rebuilding their lives. It was little Bella Walker who attends McMillan Nursery School that Mr Manderson tried to save. Bellaaposs mum Samantha Walker said she was so grateful to him for trying to help the family and was so relieved that her child pulled through after treatment in hospital. I canapost thank the man who stopped and helped me enough, everything could have been so dferent. I would also like to thank the emergency services and the doctors at the hospital on ward  who were so good. Everyone has been so brilliant. Iaposm still trying to come to terms with it, but it will come one day. The nightmares are starting now. At first when I was asleep all I could see was the black smoke and that felt safer than being awake. Iaposm so grateful itaposs not far worse. When Bella got to hospital she was on  breaths a minutes and that soon went to . We had three childrenaposs hospitals on standby but she recovered and sheaposs such a strong girl. They tried to send me for my treatment at Castle Hill but I wanted to be with her. When I was going up to see her I was waiting for the lts and they were taking too long so a lot of the time I was walking up the stairs with my drip.    It took me longer to recover because I kept running into the smoke to get up the stairs. She had managed to protect herself in her room with her duvet. “Bella has made such a speedy recovery but she still gets upset when she talks about home. It will take time to sink in and she has suffered a very traumatic experience. The family are currently staying at Mr Walkeraposs parents house in Hessle, although have been in touch with emergency housing as they are now classed as homeless. Mrs Walker said their home in north Hull is now classed as uninhabitable and will be for a year. Peter Crutchley and his crew members put on their breathing gear and the training and adrenalin kicked in when they were deployed to the fire. Peter ran upstairs and head a murmuring in a back bedroom and there he found little Bella barely conscious under the bed. “I couldn’t tell what everyone  was doing but I was focused on going in the house,” he said. “I ran upstairs and heard a faint murmur and I found Bella under the bed. I picked her up and dashed downstairs.

John Cowtan, , and his nephew James, , were kayaking off the North Wales coast when they were approached by a fast-moving jet skis multiple times. The jet skiers were filmed intentionally splashing them over and over again in an apparent attempt to capsize them on bank holiday Monday. The incident was witnessed by Mr Cowtanaposs we, Catherine, and their five-year-old daughter Emily, who watched on helplessly from the beach.Video footage taken by an onlooker shows the jet skier ing time and time again to splash the kayakers, even as they try to move away, reports North Wales Live.   Mr Cowtan, from Chwilog, said: Their behaviour really annoyed me, more so for my nephew who was really shaken by the incident. Three or four of them came over and one splashed me as he passed by. I remember wondering what that was all about but I didnapost say anything. Then they went over to a group of paddleboarders and totally took them out. One of them got back up and got back on, but they just wiped him out again. Then they came back to us and tried to capsize us. We just wanted a couple of hours of fishing, but they totally ruined the day for us and for everyone  on the beach. Itaposs a good job they didnapost break down and have to come ashore, because I think theyaposd have probably been lynched as everyone on the beach was so angry.    We had to come in in the end because we were soaked and the kayak was full of water. They just wanted to harass and cause trouble, and I think something needs to be done about it. If you were in a car and started doing wheel spins around someone, it would be a police matter because itaposs dangerous. This is anti-social behaviour at the very least. North Wales Police said they received several reports that people were riding jet skis in an aggressive manner. A spokesman said: We received several calls reporting that jet skis were riding in an aggressive manner in Criccieth harbour towards paddle boarders and canoeists. The harbourmaster and coastguard were also contacted, and the local leboat team launched a craft to deal with the situation.  Scott Beeland, who runs the Personal Watercraftgroup aimed at promoting the safe use of watercraft, said not all jet ski users are as irresponsible as the ones caught on film. He said: We are horried as a community at the shocking behaviour of this jet skier filmed in Criccieth. He is not representative of the responsible majority and is getting no support from the community over his actions. All too often when things like this happen, all jet ski users are tarred with the same brush and it turns in to a witch hunt, with people calling for bans on jet skis. His actions definitely need criticism but I want people to know that he does not represent the whole jet ski community.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA heatwave is gripping The Arctic, melting away Greenland’s ice sheet on an unprecedented scale and threatening a global rise in sea levels – an urgent reminder of the climate crisis we are now all facing. Kids splashing each other in the sea and locals wearing T-shirts were unheard of here in August  years ago. But now, alongside teenage girls wearing skirts to school and increasing mosquitoes, it is a common occurrence for the residents of Qaanaaq, in north-west Greenland, one of the world’s most northerly cities situated  miles north of the Arctic Circle. Greenland, the world’s largest island at almost three times the size of France, is now living with extreme environmental changes which could see the Arctic Sea free of ice by no action is taken.    I travelled to Greenland, home to just , people, last week to see first hand the drastic changes to conditions and to understand why it matters to us all. Away from headlines about melting ice caps and pictures of underfed polar bears unable to stalk seals on flimsy ice forced to invade towns for food, I found a community battling to adjust. Living alongside a backdrop of eerily beautul icebergs and utterly terrying melting sea ice and retreating glaciers is having a devastating impact on species, habitats and human le. This is the frontline of climate change.    Three-quarters say they have personally experienced the impact of global warming in their daily lives, from coping with dangerous sea ice journeys to having hunting sled dogs put down for economic reasons due to shorter winters - with many unaware of the full impact. While we may shrug at the decline of traditional hunting, it is impossible to visit Greenland and not be profoundly affected by their tales of how climate change has upturned their world in just a single generation. Families have been torn apart, livelihoods threatened giving us all an insight into the scale of the battle now facing humanity. “If all of Greenland’s ice were to melt, it would raise global sea levels by fett meaning cities like London, Sydney and New York underwater and the whole of Bangladesh would disappear,” says Mark Wright, director of science at WWF, who accompanied the Daily Mirror to the Arctic. “This is not science fiction. This is the reality of climate change.    “It is happening now – and here in accelerated terms – providing a crucial insight into what we will all face unless urgently tackle this now. Sea ice now forms here two months later and melts one month earlier - as temperatures rise twice as fast as the global average. This summer has seen more than  wildfires in the Arctic Circle devastating once pristine forests, turning them from precious carbon dioxide absorbing sponges into giant new emitters of greenhouse gases. The country is also experiencing record-breaking temperatures. In mid-June, along the eastern coast it was C warmer than the - average. Just as western Europe has baked in a heatwave with record temperatures at the end of July, the hot air moved as far north as Greenland with the gauge hitting C on August . The average high is around C. Journeys around the coast which took three weeks in the s because of the sea ice now take a single day. Perched beneath the world’s second largest ice cap after Antarctica, nothing other than black moss and lichen grow here. Fourth fths of Greenland is buried under an ice sheet two miles thick, much of it three million years old. But in the blink of an eye in geological terms it has begun melting – and much faster than climate change models predicted. Around % is affected, including higher elevations that only rarely see temperatures climb above freezing. In July alone  billion tonnes of meltwater poured into the Atlantic – enough to raise sea levels by .mm. We take a small fishing boat out with Joseph Manumina, , who points to a glacier he used to cross in a five-metre sled pulled by  huskies in the winter.    But like thousands of others here, the fourth-generation hunter has been forced to abandon his family trade and is now a fisherman. Joseph stops his boat beside the Hiawatha glacier and points out when he was young it stretched hundreds of metres further into the fjord. “The land you can now see was not visible at all a few years ago. But heavy rains came in  and changed the landscape for good,” he said. Last year, thanks to signicant melting, scientists discovered a -mile-long crater – the first to be found under ice – believed to be a direct result of a meteorite impact. While similar melting effects are being measured in the southern hemisphere, the Greenland sheet may be uniquely vulnerable, lying much further from the chill of the pole than Antarctica’s. Scattered across  small towns and approximately  villages, all situated on a narrow coastal strip, Greenland’s residents have often been overlooked by data science. But a first-ever national survey has examined the human impact of the climate emergency – showing % of islanders interviewed fully accept that the climate crisis is happening. The Greenlandic Perspectives Survey was carried out by the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Social Data Science, the Kraks Fond Institute for Urban Economic Research and the University of Greenland.    Lead author Kelton Minor said: “The Arctic is a bellwether for the unequal impact of global warming on social and economic systems. “As countries struggle to limit future risks and overall warming to .C many Arctic and Greenlandic residents are already living in regional climates that have changed by more than this, in less than a letime. “Therein lies the paradox: while satellites and sensors monitor the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet, chase icebergs and scan sea ice daily, relatively little is known about what the residents of Greenland think about their changing surroundings.” July st was the biggest melt day since at least , when % of sheet experienced melt. Studies found ice melt periods like the one seen seven years ago typically occur about every  years. One occuring so quickly is an important sign how quickly the climate is changing, warn experts. “This is a double edged sword, says Mark Wright, director of Science at WWF. “What we do here in the UK, they way we live our lives by burning fossil fuels, is speeding up the change. “At the same time this is affecting Greenland and other Arctic countries. But what happens here will also affect what happens at home in terms of our weather patterns and security in coastal areas. “This is why we have to take action and now. “We don’t have long left to cap this rapid change that we’ve never seen before in human history.” The rapid melting is also opening up new shipping routes and mining opportunities for deposits of rare-earth elements used in technology previously buried under ice sheets hundreds of metres thick.    It has sparked the interest of American President Donald Trump with an attempt to buy it, while China already has a mine on the island. While it is impossible to put a price on the territory, estimates range from . trillion to .trillion depending on the mining potential - believed to be enough to meet % of the world’s demand in the next  years. Trump may have cancelled his trip to Denmark for now but his suggestion is a marker of the fact Greenland is also now at the heart of a new battle for supremacy in the Arctic, where superpower competition is heating up as fast as the ice is melting.

He did not act alone.” Investigators allege Epstein’s abuse was abetted by a number of unidentied co-conspirators who are suspected of providing him with a stream of girls.    None of them have been publicly named or charged with any offence. But prosecutor, Maureen Comen, said: “This dismissal in no way deters the government’s resolve in seeking justice.” Courtney Wild, who was  when he began abusing her in Palm Beach, Florida, branded Epstein a “coward”. She told the court: “He robbed myself and all the other victims of our day in court, and for that he is a coward.” "},{"url":null,"title":"queen rejected meghan markles only","story":"NewsQueen rejected Meghan Markles only wish after wedding as it wasnt appropriateMeghan Markle and Prince Harry put a request to the Queen about their living arrangements after their wedding, but the Monarch had a very specic reason for turning them downShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video queen-meghan-markle-were-famously-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The Queen and the rest of the Royal Family looked in their element as they celebrated with the happy couple at Windsor Castle. But according to a report it was a very dferent story shortly afterwards, and the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex faced disappointment when the Monarch rejected a request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times , the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle. The report, written by Rosa Nikkah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.    But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead, which they have since spent an astounding £.million of taxpayersapos money refurbishing. Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate. He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there.    When they were dating Meghan moved into Prince Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. However shortly before the birth of Archie Harrison the couple moved into their new home, later than expected due to delays with the renovation work. List most things royal, most of the details about their new home have been kept secret - but there are a few things we do know. The couple enlisted the help of designer Vicky Charles, who is behind the decor at their favourite hangouts Soho House, to turn the building into their dream home.    Itaposs understood to be filled with all the latest tech and itaposs likely that they are able to control many dferent things from their phones. A source  told royal expert Katie Nicholl  : They are going all out with the refurbishment of the house, and as Harry loves his gadgets, it’s going to be very cool. They’ll be able to control everything from their smart phones. Itaposs understood that one the couple are also had a £, eco boiler installed, which means they will have access to hot water at all times. Frogmore Cottage is just  metres from the Long Walk - which is open to the public - so there is obviously a lot of security, which is also funded by the taxpayer.    Other entrances to the grounds are further from their new home - some just  metres away - but are further from open scrutiny, leading to fears they could be easily accessed.  Itaposs likely that they will have built a separate annex for their Private Protection Officers who will guard them  hours a day. A source close to the operation say planners have also discussed including as state of the art panic room.

Instead, she seeks out other family members, particularly her older granddaughter Zara Tindall and her rugby player husband Mike. Ingrid told the Sun Online: They are certainly light relief. She can be herself around them.    The Tindalls, who arenapost working royals, are known for being some of the most relaxed and down-to-earth members of the family. They are often seen out and about at events, and just last month Mike was pictured being very hands on with his kids Mia and Lena at a charity golf day. Zaraaposs mum Princess Anne decided not to give her daughter a HRH title, knowing she wouldnapost be high up the list of succession. This has allowed her to live a much more aposnormalapos le than her senior cousins, who have been in the limelight their entire lives. Ingrid also believes that the Queen would never get involved in any dramas between Kate, Meghan, William and Harry.    Speaking about the reported fallout between the Fab Four, she said: That would make her very sad. But she would never interfere with their lives. Itaposs been a dficult month for Meghan and Harry in particular as they were heavily criticised for taking four private planes in just  days. The couple were branded hypocrites for choosing to travel in private planes, estimated to use seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, while campaigning for action on climate change and further steps to protect the environment and wildle. Things were made even worse when Kate and William were seen taking Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis on a budget economy flight just a few days later.  The -seat Cessna plane that flew Meghan, Harry and Archie from the UK to the south of France last Wednesday belched seven times the emissions per person compared to a commercial flight, it is estimated. They also flew privately for their holiday to Ibiza the week before. A number of celebrities rushed to their defence, including Elton John who shared an emotional message referencing Princess Diana. He wrote: I am deeply distressed by today’s distorted and malicious account in the press surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s private stay at my home in Nice last week.    Prince Harry  ’s Mother, Diana Princess Of Wales was one of my dearest friends. I feel a profound sense of obligation to protect Harry and his family from the unnecessary press intrusion that contributed to Diana’s untimely death.After a hectic year continuing their hard work and dedication to charity, David and I wanted the young family to have a private holiday inside the safety and tranquility of our home.

Isla and Eilidh Noble were at the Waters of Philorth, near Fraserburgh, along the Aberdeenshire coastline yesterday afternoon when they heard cries for help. They spotted a man struggling in the water with a young boy on his shoulders. Isla, , jumped into the water with a lilo and hauled the four-year-old on to the float, while passer-by Keith Gray swam out to help pull them to shore. Her sister Eilidh, , remained on the beach and raised the alarm with the emergency services, before researching the recovery position online.  An ambulance and RNLI Fraserburgh Leboat Station attended the scene after crews were called at .pm. The man had taken in a lot of water and was blue when he was pulled from the water, Eilidh said. He regained consciousness on the beach and was flown to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary as a precaution. He thanked the two sisters for saving him and his son before being taken to hospital. Isla said: “To begin with I thought they were just playing but then he started to shout ‘help’. “I didn’t think – I just swam out as quickly as possible and pulled the kid onto the lilo. “We’d called the coastguard and an air ambulance landed right in front of us at the beach. I don’t think what happened has really sunk in yet.” Sophie Ross, a passing nurse, stopped to help. She said: “He was slipping in and out of consciousness and I was worried about secondary drowning, which is when someone is rescued from the water- but still has water in their lungs. “If that man had been in the water just  or so seconds longer, he would have fallen unconscious. “The girls were so brave and did a brilliant job – I don’t knowI could have done that. “They definitely saved two people’s lives tonight.”  It is believed the man had been on holiday in Fraserburgh with his family, who were at another part of the beach when the incident happened. Lisa Noble praised the efforts of her two daughters, who attend Fraserburgh Academy. She said: “I’d gone for a run along the beach while my husband, Frankie, cycled alongside. “My husband answered his phone then told me ‘you won’t believe this, the girls just saved someone from drowning.’ “By the time we got back the man had regained consciousness – he got the girls to come over to thank them. “There was so much fate tonight – Isla nearly forgot her phone, I told the girls not to bother bringing the lilo – and it was so lucky that Keith and Sophie were passing, it’s just amazing. “I really hope the man is making a good recovery.” "},{"url":null,"title":"trophy hunting firm seeking sales","story":"NewsTrophy hunting firm seeking sales reps sends details to anti-hunting lobbyEXCLUSIVE: League Against Cruel Sports is invited to bid to become sales rep for contemptible trophy hunting firmShareCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy Political Editor:,  AUG NewsThe existence of these peaceful animals is threatened daily by barbarous trophy hunters \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Not so long ago children were regularly slung out or cut off by parents for marrying someone of a dferent colour, faith, nationality, age, or the same sex. But then everyone relaxed a bit, stopped worrying about what the neighbours might think and realised all that mattered was that their child was in love – and was loved. Until... somethingway more important happened: Brexit. This week a survey reveals that two in five Remainers would be upsettheir child married a Leave supporter. % of those polled by YouGov said they would be ‘very upset’ and a further % said they’d be ‘somewhat upset’.  According to my O-level grade D maths, that equates to ,, people ‘upset’ – not by their child turning up with a multi-pierced serial killer Hells Angel with a swastika tattooed on his forehead – but with someone who doesn’t totally share their views on the UK EU’s future trade relationship.Meanwhile, the numbers of Leave voters who’d be upset by their child marrying a Remainer equates to around ,, people. So we’ve got around  million Brits who regard those who voted dferently to themselves in the Referendum as a more horrying marriage ­prospect than a Katie Price cast-off. Eight million people who, quite frankly, need to get things into a bit of perspective. Brexit has been used by extremists on both sides to tear this country apart and to make views increasingly hostile and entrenched.

I never wanted my parents to feel like failures. I have a college degree.    I had plenty of options but I chose sex. That bothered a lot of people including my family.

So Iaposve just been talking sex with everybody. Sylvia has been working in the adult movie industry for five years, and says it is now just completely normal to her. She now does between three and five shoots a week, and can earn about £, a time. Itaposs all very quick but it becomes so routine that I donapost even think about it anymore.

She said: After several years working I found myself very unhappy so I started doing standup. She took two jobs to pay the bill while she tried to make a name for herself in comedy, but after six month she decided to find out more about the adult industry. One of her friends worked as an adult film star and was making huge amounts of cash. She said: I wasnapost doing any comedy, and that was the reason I moved to LA. If I could make more money I could focus on comedy. And her plan worked and her work in the adult industry gave her the financial flexibility to work on her standup.  After three years of hard work her comedy started to really take off. She said: I identied with myself a bit more. I just found my feet in both comedy and adult and gained more confidence. My name was getting out there a bit. Confidence is key in both professions. They run very closely hand in hand. Being in entertainment is about knowing what people want to hear and see.

I became more humanitarian and thought how prison leaves a person lonely. The former goalkeeper went on to say: ..one cannot change the beginnings of a friendship. I have made many friends and several have been drug traffickers, I cannot change that.    I met paramilitary soldiers, I also met guerrilla fighters and from the bottom of my heart, the things they have told me have given me respect for them, as they have shown me respect... I live at ease and I live in peace.I am a friend of everyone. Higuita was reportedly offered the chance to inform on Escobar and walk away free when he was detained for being the mediator in the kidnapping of the daughter of one Escobaraposs associates.

Supranee Pansuvy spotted the dead dog on the side of the road in Prachup Khiri Khan, Thailand, yesterday afternoon. The animal appeared to have been killed by a vehicle and so Supranee stopped to move the dog away and bury her nearby. But she noticed the animalaposs tummy was enlarged and that her amniotic sac was spilling from a wound. The dog was pregnant with four puppies which were stuck inside her fluid bag. Supranee said she felt a faint heart beat in her stomach and realised one of the puppies was still alive.    She decided to perform a C-section on the dead animal and cut open its body to find one of the puppies struggling for air. Supranee then buried the rest of the puppies, who did not survive, along with their mother in an abandoned field. The rescued pup, named Jackpot, is now recovering in Supraneeaposs home.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

Figures for this year have shown a slight increase with roughly  cars per day – % of its capacity.Peter Argyle, chairman of Nestrans, said: “Ellon is doing really well because it is in the right place.“It is in a place where people can come down from Fraserburgh, Peterhead and Ellon itself and can easily park and get a bus into the centre of town.“It has been a success ever since it opened and we’ve had to expand it because it is doing so well.“The challenge for park and rides closer to the city is, by the time people have got to the roundabout at Craibstone, they think they are already so close to the city.“It is harder at this moment to persuade them to leave their car when they are as close to the city as that.“People can park relatively easily and cheaply in the city centre.“It is no criticism of any local authority or any transport provider, I think it is about driver behaviour.“People want to drive as close as they can to where they are going.”However, community leaders in Ellon have spoken of their frustration over the long-running saga over the expansion at the site.Aberdeenshire Council first submitted plans to improve the facility more than seven years ago and the local authority has yet to reveal a completion date, with a final third phase still to take place.Work had started to clear trees from the site so it could be expanded, with a bus-turning area created and additional car parking spaces.Phase two of the project will focus on the bus-turning area and creating three bus stops with enclosed shelters that will be lit and have real-time displays.Phase one saw the addition of  car parking spaces and new signs.Expansion plans have been delayed due to issues obtaining the land required.Ellon councillor Richard Thomson said: “Ellon Park and Ride is a much-valued facility in the area. It’s good to see these figures showing a consistently high level of usage.“For large parts of rural Aberdeenshire there’s no alternative to car ownership for many people. However, park and ride sites help to integrate public and private transport and give a sensible, cheap and quick alternative to driving into Aberdeen.“It’s clear that many more people could be making use of Ellon Park and Ride, which is why the delays to the long-planned expansion project have been so disappointing.”Councillor Gillian Owen, who represents Ellon, said: “When it first opened, there was a financial incentive to go to the park and ride to catch the bus, and in reality that momentum has continued.“The bus service is more frequent from the park and ride at peak times. If your work is based in and around Union Street and Union Square, the journey time has reduced since the opening of the AWPR, and you are spoilt for choice when it comes to the stops for college and university.“Once Phase Two is complete, the facilities will be second to none and the capacity will increase and hopefully this will encourage more people to use the bus.“I’m extremely disappointed that the final phase of upgrades to the PR has still to be finalised despite constant pushing and pricing of officers.”Councillor Isobel Davidson, who also represents Ellon, said: “The location suits people well and the PR then takes people into the city centre without the need to find and pay for a parking space.“It is also a relatively safe place to leave the car for longer periods so ideal for catching the airport bus or onward travel at the railway station.“The figures for Ellon Park and Ride show it is working slightly below capacity. However, with the proposed extension, it can be promoted more widely as a park and chose location for car-sharing and those travelling by bus could leave electric cars charging or bikes in safe lockers.“Perhaps someday they could even travel on by train.”Councillor Anouk Kloppert, who also represents Ellon, said: “I think it’s doing well because the Ellon Park and Ride services not only cover Aberdeen City centre but also Inverurie, Dyce and Aberdeen airport with regular services.“The car park disabled parking spaces are monitored by CCTV, secure cycle storage, has indoor facilities and is staffed at regular hours although closed on Sunday.”A spokeswoman for Stagecoach North Scotland previously said “Park and ride facilities play a vital part in sustainable travel for Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire.“One full bus can remove up to  car journeys from the road, reduce overall emissions levels and help improve air quality”.Aberdeenshire Council declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

We were incredibly grateful to get all, or most of the fish donated, which allowed us to give all the profits to the festival.

They also make for an excellently contrasting pair.From Mendelssohn’s exuberant opening bars, we are swept through music that is complex yet captivatingly, joyously melodic throughout, while Enescu’s is moody, breathlessly dramatic and, in parts, simply volcanic.Guest directed by Marianne Thorsen, SE will explore the specic charm of seeing a small group of musicians performing live. With fewer instruments, the fabric of the music becomes more tangible, subtle shts in mood may have a new-found presence, and pieces you think you know well might offer surprising new colours when heard live. With fewer musicians on stage, it is easier to follow each inidual path and witness the beautul alchemy of eight artists creating something together.Thorsen is an acclaimed soloist and passionate chamber musician. Former leader of the Nash Ensemble, she regularly performs with Norway’s Trondheim Soloists, one of the founding ensembles of The Bridge network and festival.The first half of the tour, which is called Chamber Notes, will call at Crear Studio, Kilberry, on August , followed by a performance at Mull Theatre, Tobermory, on August  before moving on to Inverness and Dundee.Other Scottish dates, including Edinburgh and Glasgow, are programmed for February .PIC:Marianne Thorsen. no_aMarianne Thorsen"},{"url":null,"title":"kilberry sportive well supported in sunshine","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Kilberry Loop Sportive saw around  cyclists take on a -mile route starting and finishing in Tarbert.All eyes were on the forecast for the non-competitive cycling event on Saturday August .

The quicker cyclists managed the  miles, which has almost  metres of climbing, in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,I would like to record my thanks to everyone who contributed to the running of the Mid Argyll Show this year.It is great for visitors to see these traditions and talent brought together and seeing young people participating in events assuring that these customs are in safe hands for the future.Thank you again to all involved in running the show.Councillor Anne HornSir,I read with some interest that a new dentist was coming to town in Lochgilphead to set up a practice, which I am sure we look forward to.The local NHS trust cannot seem to lure one to the area to work at the Mid Argyll Hospital practice, which I think is unfortunate for all concerned. We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead golf club junior championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowCongratulations to Lochgilphead Golf Club junior champion , Kern McKellar and Euan Gilmour, who was the Stableford winner."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get our mojo working","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStarting out in , Lost in Berlin is the creation of Ardrishaig-based wordsmith Russell Taylor.The name Lost in Berlin could be seen as an apt metaphor for society#s sometimes confused state.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"heres to ewe gordon","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowA -year-old  shepherd left the recent Mid Argyll Show with a clutch of prizes for his Texel sheep.Gordon MacLean, from Tarbert, saw off fine specimens of the Texel breed from more experienced sheep men and women to win the ewe lamb class.

The means for  protection is the European Union PGIdesignation, to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.Ruth, an experienced journalist, explained: #I became concerned about two years ago when, during Japan EU Canadatrade talks, the UK government did not submit one PGI for protection.#Across Europe, , food names were protected. It worries me greatly.#She continued: #I am also concerned about how hard it is becoming to source local food and drink. I live in rural Angus, and the carrots grown down the road from me started le just as Angus carrots, but they went away for packaging and came back as Great British carrots. Technically that is correct, butwe believe in supporting local farmers and making clear choices about food miles and quality, this is ridiculous.#She stressed: #This is not a protectionist campaign. I welcome trade with any part of the world as long as the farm assured quality is there.##Keep Scotland the Brand is about valuing the integrity of our food and drink and recognising that Scotland is the brand. Across the world, people recognise Scotland as a quality brand.#One in five Scots is employed in the food and drink sector, so it is vitally important to keep our brand quality.#We trust the food on our shelves at the moment. Butthe trade deals being proposed go through we#ll end up with a multi-tiered system of quality. If the Americans get the trade deal they want, the high food standards we have are really only going to be accessible to those who can afford to pay.#It#s bad enough people having to go to food banks to survive, without people not knowing why their kids are getting ill.Ruth Watson is keen to emphasise that Keep Scotland the Brand is not a political campaign and it#s not about Brexit.#It is a campaign looking at the realities of what is before us,# she says. #I think that we have to look with some alarm at the trade deals that have been done. The UK government just has not protected our food brands.##I do this campaign on a voluntary basis from my kitchen table,# she went on. #Many people do not know what is coming. Food is treated as a commodity rather than something we should be grateful for every day, that is how successful our farmers have been.#I just believe thatfarming fails, my community is going under.##I#ve been talking to elected representatives, I go round shows.

levels of both obesity and ldquobad cholesterol may also be a benefit of having the odd glass of red, after an experiment on more than  twins showed an increase in gut microbiota ersity ndash a sign of gut health ndash compared to those who drank other types of alcohol.Scientists at Kingrsquos College London were looking into the effects of beer, cider, red wine, white wine and spirits on the gut microbiome, the micro-organisms found in the digestive tracts of humans.They found that the gut microbiome of red wine drinkers was more erse compared to those who had other drinks, which researchers speculate could be due to a higher amount of defence chemicals called polyphenol that act as an antioxidant.ldquoWhile we have long known of the unexplained benefits of red wine on heart health, this study shows that moderate red wine consumption is associated with greater ersity and a healthier gut microbiota that partly explain its long-debated beneficial effects on health, Dr Caroline Le Roy, first author of the findings, said.Results from the  UK female twins who participated in the research also matched up to three other groups tested in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.However, professionals have also warned that the positives should still be weighed up against the negative impacts of alcohol.ldquoNo doctor would recommend drinking on medical grounds, as any potential benefits of red wine polyphenols should be considered alongside alcoholrsquos links to over  health conditions, including heart disease and cancers as identied in the Chief Medical Officerrsquos

effect, Dr Le Roy added.ldquoIf you must choose one alcoholic drink today, red wine is the one to pick as it seems to potentially exert a beneficial effect on you and your gut microbes, which in turn may also help weight and risk of heart disease.ldquoHowever, it is still advised to consume alcohol with moderation.Professor Tim Spector, lead author from Kingrsquos College London, added: ldquoThis

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"filming-taking-place-port-seton-high-street","story":"A short film called Fishing by LS Productions means that a rolling road closure has been created.This is when the road is mainly open, but traffic will be lsquopausedrsquo to clear the road at times.It is a system commonly used in cycling and road events.There will also be parking restrictions in place.When asked, LS Productions marketing team informed the Courier that due to signing non-disclosure agreements, they were unable to say anything more about the film."},{"url":null,"title":"surge-39-struggling-39-families-sees-demand-kids-39-lunch-club-soar","story":"More than  children took part in this summerrsquos club compared to just  when it began in .And Universal Credit has been blamed for the dramatic increase in families who need help providing their children with a healthy meal, during the holidays.Sandra King, from Preston Seton Gosford Area Partnership, who help fund the club, which runs in Prestonpans and Tranent, said there was no doubt the impact of East Lothian being used to pilot the roll-out of Universal Credit was being witnessed.She said: ldquoIt is like being back in the Seventies: the number of families who are struggling and need support is high and the Universal Credit pilot in East Lothian has definitely had an impact.The outward appearance of East Lothian as an affluent county was misleading, she added, with families in all of its town and communities struggling.She said: ldquoEven in places like North Berwick we are seeing families affected.

And Scotland is leading the way, with the Scottish government aiming for renewable sources to generate the equivalent of  per cent of Scotlandrsquos gross annual electricity consumption by .To allow us to use more renewable energy we need to upgrade our current system to a smarter energy network.This will ensure we make the most of the greener energy available and open the door to a more sustainable future.With the uptake of smart meters in homes around Great Britain will come a new, smarter system, which is a more flexible and decarbonised. Whatrsquos more, this system is central to the country reducing its CO emissions, whilst being more reliable, sustainable and cost-effective.The increased complexity of the system and the need to be able to flexibly match supply and demand means that digitalisation is an important part of the transition. Central to digitalisation is the accurate measurement of customer energy demands so the system can provide energy in the most efficient and costeffective way, and customers can accurately understand how they use energy. And that is where smart meters ndash available from your energy supplier at no extra cost - come in.Simply put, smart meters will make Britainrsquos energy grid, and energy system, smarter. This is because the data that they are able to generate allows our energy network to understand how much energy is being used, when and where across Great Britain. The system will also be able to draw on more local and renewable sources of energy.Our electricity needs are predicted to double by , so we have to upgrade our outdated energy grid.

I think for many parents who have childcare challenges,there can be a real sense of relief as the summer holidays end, and to some extent I feel that myself.The pressure to fill six weeks with entertainment and activities, and go on holiday, can be immense, especially on a tight budget. For some children too, the holidays can be a dficult time and school can offer them ato some familiar routine.However, I remember the impending dread I felt when I was a child in the final days of the summer holidays. I hated the back to school adverts on TV as they heralded the end of free days playing on the rocks at the Pans shore, and of loosely defined bedtimes.So I was glad that our youngest daughter Skye was looking forward to school as she enters P. She met friends she hadnrsquot seen in weeks this morning and smiled as she said hello to George the lollipop man.She seemed slightly anxious as she waited in line in a new place, but the friendly manner of her new teacher visibly lted her mood and she went in with a smile, unknowingly tracing my childhood footsteps and those of her big sister.But then as I walked home, I was suddenly overwhelmed with anxieties: money worries, work worries, deadlines, bills etc. It seemed asduring the holiday period I had consciously decided to put such thoughts aside, to just enjoy the family time. Now was the pay back, we had ed to lsquorealityrsquo.But then I suddenly remembered a tale a fellow storyteller had told me many years ago. It just popped into my head and it spoke to me as I wandered back. And the truth in the story was the antidote I needed in that moment. And so I will share it with you in case you may one day find you need it:There was once a weaver who was weighed down with worries. He had so many things to do, so many responsibilities he looked into the future with dread. His worries kept him awake at night, which of course made his worrying worse during the next day. It was a vicious cycle.Then one day, he was sitting at his loom working and his worries got in the way. He couldnrsquot concentrate and he made mistake after mistake. He cursed and this was heard by an auld guidewe who happened to be passing by his window.ldquoFir whit reason dae ye curse at yer loom son, is there nae joy in yer work  she asked.The weaver looked up, feeling ashamed: ldquoIrsquom sair sorry fir ma words. Itrsquos just that as I work I think aboot orsquo ma troubles.The old woman nodded in understanding. She knew about troubles herself.ldquoAye, she said with an understanding nod, ldquotroubles can fair get ye doon.Then she paused and thought for a moment. She could see in the weaverrsquos face that he was riddled with anxieties.ldquoCan I show ye something that will tak ye awa frae yer work fir only a few minutes The weaver was happy to have a break so he left his loom and came outside.ldquoDae ye hae a bucket  asked the guidewe.ldquoA bucket ldquoAye a bucket, tae put some water in, she explained.The weaver fetched his bucket, wondering what the old woman was going to do with it.She took it to the well and filled it with a little water.ldquoNoo son, I dinnae kenthis will be tae heavy fir ye tae hold up.The weaver laughed: ldquoOrsquo course itrsquos no too heavy, fir ye only put a wee drop orsquo water in it.So the woman asked him to prove this by holding up the bucket with arms outstretched. The weaver had strong arms because of his work and held the bucket before him without any effort.ldquoAh, said the guidewe, ldquosae itrsquos nae tae heavy.ldquoIt isnae heavy at arsquo, replied the weaver.The old woman smiled: ldquoIn that case, keep haudin it afore ye like that fir  minutes. He wondered why she was asking him to do this, andshe was just trying to make a fool of him. But he was also intrigued and knew her to be an honest old soul, and so he did as she asked.After a few minutes of holding the bucket in front of him, it began to feel much heavier. After five minutes, his arms began to ache and soon they began to shake. The pain began to spread to his back as he desperately tried to keep the bucket in position.ldquoIs  minutes no over yet  asked the weaver desperately.ldquoIf the bucket is now tae heavy fir ye, put it doon son.He was reluctant to admit that the bucket was now too heavy to hold and so put it down.ldquoThe water got heavier son, didnrsquot it ldquoThe water wasnae heavier, protested the weaver, ldquoye just made me hold the bucket for tae lang.ldquoSae the water did get heavier, no in itself, but for you!The weaver looked confused and the guidewe continued.ldquoWater can get heavierye haud it ower lang afore ye, evenitrsquos just a wee drop. Yer worries are like that water, son. I am sure that they are many but ye mak them much heavierye try tae haud them in yer thochts arsquo the time.She smiled at him: ldquoTry an put the bucket doon as often as ye can,ye ken whit I mean. Dinnae mak it heavier than needs be. When ye need tae, haud it, but no arsquo the time.ldquoIn fact, she added while raising a pointed finger, ldquohauding it arsquo the time gies ye pain and paralyses ye. Yersquoll hae nae ability left tae empty the bucket.And so the old woman wandered off, leaving her words with the weaver. He looked down at the bucket. He lted it again and held it in front of him. It wasnrsquot as heavy now as before, but still had the same amount of water in it. She was right, water can get heavieryou hold it for longer, even though itrsquos the same weight.He chuckled to himself and watched the woman as she waddled down the street.ldquoThank ye! he called out.He ed to his loom. This time he whistled and sang as he worked. He enjoyed his creation and made no mistakes, for he had put his bucket of worries down for a while.Later they would still be there, but they might seem lighter and easier to manage now that they had stopped paralysing him with anxiety.And so that was the story. And as I arrived home, I realised that although I needed to deal with lots of things, I wasnrsquot going to give my worries more weight by holding them constantly in my thoughts.Itrsquos really

The procedure for iding matrimonial property, which is any money and other assets owned jointly or inidually is that it is to be ided fairly, which may not simply mean equally. If the situation has to be resolved in court that can result in a decision that is far from satisfactory to one ndashor both ndashof the partners.ldquoItrsquos important that we advise clients about the fact that Alternative Dispute Resolution is available. These situations emphatically donrsquot involve an inevitable progress to court ndashwhich should be regarded as very much the last resort, he says.In fact, some % or more of cases are now dealt with through negotiation rather than a court order that determines the ision of assets. People who proceed to court, says Ferry almost inevitably have an urgent issue such as suffering from a serious shortage of money or protection issues resulting from circumstances of domestic abuse.The alternative routes principally involve collaboration or mediation. Mediation, involves an independent mediator guiding the parties toward a solution. The mediator does not usually give them legal advice as to their entitlements though in assisted mediation both parties have their solicitors in the background .ldquoThat is an option that sometimes works out well ndash but many people are looking for veriable answers, and this can be achieved through the collaborative approach which I find is generally a better way to resolve disagreements.Ferry, a trained collaborative lawyer, believes this route is best to minimise conflict and secure financial choices ndashwhile also, importantly, ensuring the best future for the children. He explains that collaborative law involves the parties and their advisers in four-way meetings with discussions around the table, in private and without the delay of correspondence and court proceedings. And this, he says helps to avoid subsequent, and potentially costly, misunderstandings.The problem with pensionsPensions, for example, can become very contentious. ldquoIn our experience pensions are frequently overlooked by clients when considering orce settlements. However, the value of the pensions built up during the marriage or civil partnership is taken into account and can be substantial. Our clientsrsquo settlements often involve pension sharing agreements.ldquoHowever, pensions can be extremely complicated ndashnot only in terms of valuing them and iding them but itrsquos also important to get the best advice on which pensions should be shared and which should not. Some have more benefits attached to them than others. For example, there may be spousersquos benefits attached to them which may be very valuable.In addition, he adds, there are ious types of pensions such as Self Invested Personal Pensionswhich can be convoluted when dealing with them in orce cases as sometimes these can involve multiple underlying property and other assets contained in the pension which may need to be valued too.ldquoYou need to take advice not only about its value at the date of separation but also its type of pension and current value. A failure to identy pension interests or to correctly apportion the value of a pension may have dramatic long-term implications for either spouse and there is a strict timescale involved after orce for implementing the pension share.Business assetsFerry says that clients also need advice about business assets and shareholdings, as to what constitutes matrimonial property as these can, inadvertently, be converted into matrimonial property in the course of, for example, restructuring a company that was founded or bought before marriage.ldquoShareholdings that may be worth several millions can be transferred into the joint matrimonial pot and that possibility is not often considered by the accountant or tax advisor involved, he says.These are just a few of the issues to be considered but despite the obvious vexations that separation and orce involve, Ferry believes in confronting them in a positive, proactive way. The Family LawAct of  was well thought out and is quite flexible, providing for the needs of inidual cases, he says.Divorce, he adds, need not end up in long, drawn out court proceedings. ldquoWhether via a pre-nuptial agreement or a collaborative resolution, with good legal advice parties can deal with separation and orce in way that achieves the solution that works best for them both.Noel specialises in all areas of family law but is particularly noted for acting in high value cases for high net worth iniduals, for example, celebrities, sports personalities, entrepreneurs, business owners, directors, professionals and executives.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

One way we can fight back against ecological collapse is to have wilder, unmown, unsprayed spaces around us. Short grass and manicured parks may look neat but itrsquos vital to have flourishing wild spaces too.Rewilding East Lothian wants the council to commit to planting thousands more trees to help absorb the carbon dioxide emissions that are driving global warming.In addition, the council has been challenged to radically reduce mowing and weed-killing, since weeds provide homes for bees and other pollinators, and to mitigate the loss of green spaces to housing by proactively making dedicated areas for nature to flourish.A council spokeswoman said East Lothianrsquos reputation as the Garden County was ldquoappreciated by residents and visitors alike.

The world is a much better place as a result but, unlike with family, the bonds and obligations of friendship are less clear-cut. Sometimes ties wither naturally, at others, rash or destructive relationships have actively to be severed. This is an unpleasant fact of le and one that Prince Andrew is discovering belatedly to his cost.For some time now, speculation has been mounting after the publication of a photo showing the Prince walking in a New York park with his friend, the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was recently found dead in a prison cell, where he awaited trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to engage in sex-trafficking.The headlines must have made the Palace shudder, their insinuations all too clear. After details of a US lawsuit mentioning him were released, a terse statement was issued distancing the Prince from historic accusations made against Epstein, and claiming that ldquoAny suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.:Prince Andrew hosted Jeffrey Epstein at BalmoralClose observers of Buckingham Palace might have noticed a cloud of dust around the flagpole as the house was shaken to its foundations. When the Daily Mail published footage recently showing the Duke of York ushering a young woman out of Epsteinrsquos Manhattan apartment in , a further statement was issued. The Duke, it said, ldquodeplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent.Poor Prince Andrew. He is discovering what every child in the playground knows: that you are tarred and feathered with the same brush as those with whom you mix. If one of your gang throws a brick through a window, you are deemed guilty too, evenyou did nothing wrong.In the case of His Royal Highness, letrsquos put aside for a moment the suspicions his closeness to Epstein, following his release from prison, arouse. Bad enough that Andrewrsquos personal contacts are so dodgy they raise serious questions about his judgement, let alone his behaviour.If nothing , these images suggest one of two things: that the Prince was a loyal chum who stuck by Epstein, despite his ruined reputation and the risk it posed to his own. Or that, living as he did in a gilded cage, removed from real le and the consequences of any stupid decisions he made, he was utterly unconcerned about the effect their friendship might have on his prospects. When you are cocooned from birth in a cradle of privilege when you are feted, indulged, and pandered to by sycophants and liggers from the minute you can shake a rattle, it must be easy to believe you are above the normal rules and standards by which society works.Meeting in the park with Epstein was, at best, decidedly odd for someone in Prince Andrewrsquos position. Going to his apartment, however, where a stone satyr presides over the front door, was simply crazy. According to police who raided the property, they seized photos of underage girls. These and the fetishist decor would have led most ordinary visitors to make a swt exit.These images of the Duke of York date from the period when he was acting as British ldquoSpecial Representative for Trade and Investment. A bespoke role for an aimless aristocrat, it gave him licence to roam the globe, meeting fat cats in rich countries and opportunistic states in the hope that some of their wealth would find its way into Britainrsquos Treasury.:In Pictures: Commonwealth leaders gather for state dinnerDuring his deployment as an envoy, Prince Andrew made ious embarrassing ldquomissteps, among them some politically unwise associations. Nothing, however, could compare with being identied as one of Epsteinrsquos cronies, after which revelation he relinquished the post.As the grapevine quivers with anticipation over other high-profile names likely to be found in Epsteinrsquos fat address book, the Dukersquos predicament is increasingly grave. He can hide behind the Palace gates and hope the storm will pass, but this is a story that has been brewing for years. Until certain questions are satisfactorily answered, as far as hersquos concerned it is far from over.Doubtless, it will go against every royal instinct, but would he not be wiser to face the cameras, do an in-depth interview, and silence ndash perhaps even charm ndash his critics  In a situation like this, where unfettered gossip is fuelling supposition, Prince Andrew surely needs to explain his connection with Epstein and help suffocate the scandal. It would, of course, be a historic move. No member of the royal dynasty has ever voluntarily gone on record to put their side of a wildfire story, with the exception of Princess Diana. In her unforgettable, kohl-eyed interview with Martin Bashir, she was more focused on scoring points against Prince Charles than in illuminating her own often dubious actions.Sticklers for Palace protocol might feel sick at the thought of Prince Andrew going public. Even in the hands of the most measured journalist ndash Kirsty Wark, say, or Fiona Bruce ndash it would be viewed as stepping into the lionrsquos den, a suicidally reckless act. Added to which, the Windsors do not explain. They take a long view, recognising that the passage of time usually allows even the most unsavoury episodes to fade into oblivion.In this instance, however, that seems unlikely. So what is worse  Staying schtum, and waiting for more seedy revelations to be added to the blaze, or allowing the Duke to get ahead of the story, and give his version of events By remaining aloof, the Palacersquos response suggests it hopes to avoid further fallout. The implication of this is all too plain: royals might not be above the law, but its arm would have to be very long indeed to winkle one of them out of the front door and into a Black Maria. Inviting a Windsor to a police interview, let alone into a courtroom, would require Herculean effort, and a mountain of cast-iron evidence. By contrast,Andrew were willing to face, refute and defuse the rumours, it would be an act of bravery to restore family pride."},{"url":null,"title":"theatre-review-crocodile-rock-oran-mor-glasgow-four-stars","story":"Crocodile RockOran Mor, GlasgowMary Brennanfour starsA Play, a Pie and a Pint is still in the mood to celebrate  productions since its inception, so some previous successes are in the autumn roster alongside new scripts.

Russellclaimed that a letter from European Commission official Viviane Reding defined an independent Scotlandrsquos position in Europe I chose to ignore it. However his subsequent insistence that being on official paper meant it was the definitive legal position of the EU left me with no choice but to intervene and correct him .I now note that despite this he still seems to be maintaining his stance that Ms Redingrsquos letter is still ldquothe best available information on the issue. This appears to be on the basis that Alex Salmondrsquos contrary claim is ldquounsupported by independent legal opinion . I would challenge that latter assertion.Ms Redingrsquos letter is itself unsupported by legal opinion. The situation of a member state splitting in two has not occurred in the history of the EU . So there is no legal precedent.However there is a legal precedent to support Mr Salmondrsquos case for a third country joining the EU without the requirement to go through any negotiations or any revision of the Treaties. When East Germany joined the EU in  it was deemed to be effective from the moment unication with West Germany took place. It was seen to be merely the enlargement of an existing member state with the new combined entity being called lsquoGermanyrsquo.:Neil Mackay: Where have all the big ideas on independence gone An independent Scotland would be in a similar situation, but this time as a third country formed by the reduction in size of an existing member state as opposed to enlargement. Unlike East Germany, however, it would already have met all the criteria for membership by dint of having been in the EU for  years. As such it would be unique and therefore unlike any other third country applying for membership. That is the key point.If the Commission stipulated that Scotland would require to apply for membership like all other third countries, it would have to explain to the European Court of Justice why the legal precedent established by East Germanyrsquos accession to the EU was being disapplied in this instance.By any measure this would be an extremely spurious legal argument for the Commission to advance, especially when Scotland has a stronger economy than East Germany had, was fully compliant with EU rules, and was a known and respected European country with no history of secret police involvement.

On the Yes side, nothing has substantively changed, when it comes to big ideas, since the SNP laid out its blueprint for independence in .Brexit has altered the backdrop of the constitutional debate, but apart from a decision by SNP members to support the creation of a new currency as quickly as possible after independence, which many Yes voters donrsquot agree with, therersquos been little in the way of political imagination, creativity and innovation. The plan for Citizensrsquo Assemblies was visionary but itrsquos been undermined by SNP politicisation.Thatrsquos not to say that hard work hasnrsquot been done on the nuts and bolts of independence. The SNPrsquos Growth Commission report on the finances of an independent Scotland presented some serious economic thinking, but this is not the stuff upon which visions of new nations are built, this is the stuff of the seminar room.: Neil Mackay:Irsquom a Yes voter, but Irsquom now sick and tired of my own sideThe No side is even worse. All thatrsquos heard from the No camp is the word lsquoNorsquo. Wherersquos their vision of what a Scotland remaining in the union will look like  Brexit has shown both the Tories and Labour to be intellectually bankrupt when it comes to the future of Scotland. Yoursquod get more vision walking around a darkened room with your eyes closed than you would listening to most unionist politicians in Scotland.The new co-leader of the Scottish Green Party, Lorna Slater, seems to share concerns about the level of intellectual debate around the future of Scotland. She too worries about the vision thing.Slater has identied a few problems. Firstly, the impression that the SNP ldquoowns the idea of independence. Many Yes voters donrsquot support the SNP ndash yet itrsquos the SNP which dictates most of the discussion around independence. When a monolithic, managerial party controls debate then the drain on vision wersquore experiencing is inevitable. Whatrsquos good for the SNP in terms of holding on to power isnrsquot necessarily in the best interests of independence.A resurgence of all those grassroots Yes organisations which sprung up as the first referendum approached would provide an intellectual counterweight to the SNP, and a laboratory for new ideas.Slater is also concerned that ldquomuch of the debate around independence has focused on whether or not there should be a referendum. We should be focusing on what we want an independent Scotland to look like.Shersquos right. A second referendum will happen at some stage in the relatively near future, but what really matters,you are a Yes voter, is making sure the vision for the country is in place in order to convince the people that independence is the right course of action when the time comes.Brexit has taught us hard lessons. There was no real discussion, no real vision, about what a post-Brexit Britain would look like. A national conversation needs to begin in Scotland about the kind of country we want to be after independence.What about a constitution  The monarchy  The nature of the army  Our relationship with America  A second parliamentary chamber  Our role in Europe These issues cannot be left up to the SNP. Politicians make decisions in the best interests of their party, not the country. Parties care about power not people.We need to know the substance of what wersquore voting for, rather than the intellectually bereft binary of Yes and No. The Greens are certainly setting out a clear vision for Scotland after independence. The environment will be the top priority, there will be a move away from oil and gas.Of course, the Greens also flatlined on around eight per cent of the vote during the European elections in May. However, that disappointment may account for their renewed push for a big vision for Scotland now.The Greens need to get out from under the shadow of the SNP. Being seen by voters as \"the other party which also supports independence\" isnrsquot a strategy, especially when Greens can provide a clear, progressive vision for the country which the SNP with its disparate factions cannot.The SNP is ready to splinter into left, right and centre the moment Scotland becomes independent. In the era of climate change, the Greens have a simple and important story to tell which other parties do not.However, honesty is the greatest storyline ndash the strongest vision ndash to present to Scotland. So letrsquos be honest. If Scotland votes Yes to independence in any future referendum, we need to accept that it is inevitable that the nation will need a confirmatory referendum on any deal negotiated with the rest of the UK regarding separation.Dr Alan Renwick, of University College Londonrsquos Constitution Unit, has raised this issue saying that a confirmatory vote would avoid the ldquoacrimony and gridlock of Brexit. He refers to the ldquograve democratic quandary where the public has not been allowed to make ldquoan informed choice about the type of Brexit the country goes through. Renwick suggests opting for a confirmatory vote might increase the turnout for Yes with the public willing to back independence in theory and then see what the politicians negotiate.A future independence referendum would be a ldquopre-legislative ballot, instructing politicians to negotiate a deal which we then vote on. That seems perfectly democratic and the kind of vision we need for this country.:Majority now want Scottish independence, says phenomenal new pollIt immediately shows a commitment to democracy over party politics, a willingness to tackle emotional and isive subjects in a collegiate way, and it projects an adult image of this nation while many other countries seem to be reverting to childhood.The First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and some of her inner circle may be publicly voicing their discomfort with the baggage that comes with the concept of nationalism of late, in an attempt to woo soft No voters, but the one thing which will change swithering minds is honestly tackling the dficulties which the journey towards independence will involve.It will not be easy - it will be hard.

They struggle to deal with it, and find a coherent vision of how to reconcile peoples need for identity and the demands of economic opportunity and social justice.Brexit has upset the UKrsquos constitutional applecart, and this English nationalist project has encouraged Scottish nationalism. Both projects seek to break up multinational unions in the name of sovereignty. Brexit has already split the UK down the middle, and similar vote in some future Scottish referendum would create a fissure in Scottish society that would last generations. We need something better.Whatever happens with Brexit, there is an alternative for the UK. The risks to economic opportunity and social justice presented by independence stem not from acknowledging Scottish identity, nor from increasing Scottish autonomy, but from breaking the economic and social bonds of the United Kingdom. Its domestic market is vital for Scotlands economy, and sharing resources across the UK supports social justice in Scotland through welfare and public spending programmes, as we saw again last week the latest GERS figures.We do not have to lose these benefits in order to gain more autonomy. Instead, Scotland, and the rest of the UK, should move to a more federal system. The structures of federalism, which means dferent levels of government each with their own responsibilities, can support dferent social models, but I argue for a progressive form of federalism, one designed to create the maximum scope for social justice in each part of the country. Here is what it would mean for Scotland.First of all, it implies a change of mindset in the whole UK, from the worn-out notions of parliamentary sovereignty which drive so much of our overcentralised government, especially in England, to an understanding that the UK really is a multinational state, a voluntary association of nations which come together to preserve their identities and promote their shared interests. That implies a better form of entrenchment for devolution in the UK constitution. Given the circumstances of Brexit, it means entrenching wider powers too.More important, perhaps, it implies a design which embeds the purpose of social justice in the territorial constitution. The federal UK parliament and government should be responsible for providing a guaranteed level of welfare and public service provision across the whole territory, irrespective of whether local taxable resources are big enough to support it, much as today.But government in the devolved nations should have the capacity to increase this from their own resourcesthey think it necessary. Thatrsquos an each-way bet for social justice.Wersquore already close to that for Scotland today. Not only is the Scottish Parliament responsible for most major public services, but it can supplement any welfare benefit it thinks unjustly small. It has the money too: not only is the devolved budget about  per cent per head higher than English levels, Holyrood has wide tax powers too.A UK which followed these principles would make a similar offer to the dferent regions of England. Many of those who voted Leave in the European referendum were expressing a beef with London, not Brussels: thats where they need to take back control from.Those obsessed with sovereignty and identity see nationalism as an end in itself. History tells us this is a dangerous road. But those who want to promote social justice and co-operation between dferent peoples cannot ignore the human need for acknowledgement of their identity. For them the right approach is a model of progressive federalism, empowering the UKrsquos nations and regions in a way which gives each level of government the power to promote a just society.This will be one of the themes explored by the new Think Tank Our Scottish Future being launched with an address by former PM Gordon Brown in Edinburgh this week."},{"url":null,"title":"four-go-trial-accused-trafficking-women-glasgow","story":"Three men and a woman are alleged to have brought more than a dozen women from Slovakia and held them in ldquoslavery or servitude.

But Mr Corbyn, the keenest subscriber to the view that hersquos best suited to the job, was yesterday sounding out other Westminster opposition leaders. Alas, since theyrsquod settle for anyone, except Mr Corbyn, they united instead on seeking a legislative route to rule out a no-deal Brexit.Unsurprisingly, because they paint an exit with no deal as a national disaster along the lines of the Black Death or Scotlandrsquos  World Cup campaign. Yet even those people, who previously promised to implement the referendum result, thenstood on a manesto promising to implement the result, then, by one of the biggest Commons vote ever, voted to implement Article , specying ldquono deal as the default, balked at putting Mr Corbyn in power as the price of stopping any hard exit.Itrsquos dficult to see how legislation guarantees the prevention of no deal, though. Itrsquos an illogical position, when no deal is the default, and when any restrictions wouldnrsquot be binding on the PM, nor even necessarily within his gt .It is, however, no more bonkers than the Brexit Partyrsquos insistence that only a no deal Brexit is real Brexit ndash a stance no doubt inspired by government failure to deliver, but one that no one was advocating three years ago.Mr Corbyn, unlike the other party leaders, mentioned the continued possibility of a vote of no confidence. As Leader of the Opposition, hersquos best-placed to table one, but that is the extent of his advantage. Assumingit were won, the Labour leader would then have to demonstrate he had the necessary support to form a government, which means about  votes: ie, persuading some  non-Labour MPs to vote for him.The prospect of Tories, even those practically demented by the idea of no deal, backing that is nil. The Lib Dems have ruled it out. It would be a huge strategic error for the SNP. And thatrsquos before you take into consideration the fact that there could well be about  of Mr Corbynrsquos own MPs who wouldnrsquot vote for it.Mr Corbyn, despite not banging on about it in his meeting, is still apparently insisting that a vote would mean him becoming prime minister .I think a GNU would be undemocratic, undesirable and unlikely. But in a fantasy world where the proposed interim PM were Ken Clarke, or Harriet Harman, itrsquos just about possible. But you would need a vote of no confidence first. So the person best placed to bring it about is Jeremy Corbyn, and the biggest obstacle to it happening is Jeremy Corbyn.Small wonder the other leaders preferred to make it a last resort, trying instead to rule out no deal by legislation. The problem is that you canrsquot, with absolute certainty, for both practical and political reasons. Practically, because MPs have to vote for something, anything  to avoid what is otherwise the default position, and so far they canrsquot agree on what that would be. Eventhey could, therersquos no guarantee itrsquos anything thatrsquos on offer.And while the no deal absolutists are as deluded as the revoke extremists, there are potential deals ndash and the one negotiated by Theresa May is one ndash clearly even worse than no deal. Thatrsquos why MPs voted it down three times.Politically, this approach is tricky because, while Boris Johnson says he would still rather have a deal, he is totally committed to exit by October . Just as his mind wonrsquot be changed by a vote saying MPs wonrsquot accept no deal, nor will such a vote magic away the fact that itrsquos the legal default. His opponents would also have to commit to some positive course of action to replace it: either the blatantly anti-democratic nuclear option of outright revocation, or acceptance of some deal that is actually on offer at the time. Or an election.By contrast, the PM has nothing to lose by calling an election. Therersquos a sporting chance he could win itwersquove left the EU, or would do so during the campaign, or at oncehe won. Therersquos the near-certainty that the Brexit Party would prevent him winninghe were to show the slightest sign of backing down on the date.This is now a game of chicken where everyone ndash Johnson, Corbyn, Remainers, Brexit absolutists, and the EU ndash believes that their only chance of getting what they want is not to blink.

His musical collecting and recordings pre-dates the Folk Revival of the s and s and consequently are unique.David Cook, sub-committee chair of Live Le Aberdeenshire, said: “We are delighted to accept this unique collection of local and national signicance into the permanentcollections of Aberdeenshire Council Museums.“Whilst the recordings are in good condition, they are threatened by physical degradation and some are stored on formats that can no longer be played. Being part of this national initiative will ensure some of our local recordings of Scots music will be digitally preserved and available to folk at home and abroad for future enjoyment and learning.”Alastair Hardie, one of the trustees acting on behalf of the late John Junner, said: “In his will, John Junner asked for his collection to be kept ‘at a suitable location in northeast Scotland’.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said armed forces personnel make huge sacrices to keep us all safe\"  Aberdeenshire Council achieves gold award for work with armed forces, families, veterans and cadetsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"It is claimed the Violet Route for dualling the A could endanger Fyfe House\"  Action group “appalled” at threat to Guiding house viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"\"Ten years after his death, his wish has finally been fulfilled with this donation.

The aim is for all recycling centres to reach % by .Up to  new staff are due to be in place by mid-September and will provide advice and assistance to householders about what can be recycled. The additional roles are part of package of improvements agreed by councillors in January.However, a new permit scheme is also being introduced to move business waste away from recycling centres to create more space for new recyclable materials to improve services to householders.While most businesses pay the necessary fees to dispose of their waste and recycling responsibly, the current open access to recycling centres means some business waste is being presented as household waste so that it can be processed free of charge.To tackle this, a new permit scheme is one of the measures being introduced next year to prevent such abuse. Under the new scheme householders using commercial type vehicles - vans, pick-ups, minibuses or trailers - to take materials to recycling centres will require a permit to do so.The permits will be free of charge and can be used at any of the  recycling centres operated by the council.Households will be able to apply for the free permits in advance and a yearrsquos supplywill be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Permits can be applied for online or by post at any time of the year and will be valid for  months.Aberdeenshire Council does not expect the new scheme to have an impact on most householders as permits will not be required for cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs or xs, unless they tow a trailer or a horse box.Permits can be obtained for trailers up to  x  ft in size.Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses will not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailersand vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Aberdeenshire Councilrsquos Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: ldquoThe approval of the new permit system is very good news as it will allow us to make space for more recyclable materials at recycling centres and improve services for householders.ldquoMost households will not be affected by the permit system at all as cars, estate cars, people carriers, MPVs and xs will continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.ldquoWe are keen to minimise inconvenience to those householders who use commercial type vehicles or trailers to take materials to recycling centres.\"Only one application is required to get a yearrsquos supply of permits and we have also increased the number of permits to  per year to make sure householders have enough permits to cover the grass cutting season.ldquoWe will be communicating the details of the new permit scheme over the coming months, so there will be plenty of time to apply for the permits before the new scheme starts.ldquoBusinesses will be provided an alternative service at waste transfer stations, and with a lower price for recycling, will be encouraged to segregate and recycle as much of their waste as possible.ldquoWe will be monitoring closely how the new schemes settle in and can tweak them in future based on feedback received.More information about the new recycling permit scheme is available on www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk recyclingcentrepermitsdata-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

Average tax revenue per head was demonstrated to be £ lower in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, while spending per head has climbed to £,. Put together, these two figures define the fiscal transfer of £, per man woman and child that takes place seamlessly between the UK Treasury and the Scottish Government, including apportioned UK spending for defence and other mutual services Scotland benefits from.By themselves the GERS figures cannot and do not sayan independent Scotland could be economically sustainable. What they tell us is where the likely starting point would be were we to decide to leave the UK, before any changes could be made in Scottish government policy to alter the existing landscape. There would be notional Scottish spending of £.bn supported by an income of only £.bn – giving the estimated deficit of £.bn. Against Scotland’s Gross Domestic Productthe deficit was  per cent, compared to a deficit of . per cent for the UK. To put this in context Scotland would have the largest deficit as a share of GDP in the developed world, certainly the worst in Europe and way beyond the EU’s guideline limit of  per cent for its members.Taking account of the regional figures available via the UK’s Office of National Statistics there can be no doubt that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland provide a deficit against England’s surplus that leaves the whole UK in deficit, albeit reducing. Given the foregoing, Scotland’s receipt of this fiscal transfer is obviously not unique, indeed within England itself the tax revenues from the three regions of London, the South East and East notionally transfer to support all the other English regions, including the North West, North East, Yorkshire and West Midlands.This is the nature of fiscal transfers, where economically prosperous nations or regions fund a pool that is used to support those parts of the UK that are enduring harder times. Contributions and withdrawals to and from this pool will y over time, with some requiring help one year – or even decades – while at other times being the source of community municence.It is dangerous to justy participation in a country purely on economic terms while ignoring the greater historical, social and cultural bonds or strategic interests that make an entity greater than the sum of its parts. It is a good thing that when oil revenues collapsed the UK was able to ensure there was no catastrophic impact on Scottish public finances – as there would have beenScotland had voted for independence in . It is not a good thing for Scotland to run a large deficit and be reliant on the UK to make that forever possible.To justy Scotland’s place in the UK because it receives a “union idend” of nearly £, per person is like accelerating towards a blind summit, unaware of the hard landing that awaits politically.If unionists rely upon a figure to define the union idend then they must accept that correspondingly there will in some years be a union premium – a time when Scotland’s allocated tax revenues are greater than the spending it makes. Personally, I think this is a good thing, for it is what the union idend is really all about. It is a process, not a number a process that is built upon British solidarity, a shared experience of helping each other in times of great need from our hardest endeavours, creative genius or even just fortunate bounty.Indeed we can see from the official figures over the last  years that there have been times when Scotland has contributed to the maintenance of the UK and others when it has itself been supported. Since  Scotland has contributed a net £bn to the UK in real terms – a figure that shall undoubtedly be cancelled out by next year’s GERS figures. I know it is hard to imagine at a time when the SNP Scottish Government demonstrates with impressive regularity its ability to miscalculate it own economic forecasts and deliver poorer results in too many sections of the pubic services year-on-year – but the deficit could eventually change were the politicians to alter their centralising and incompetent ways.The private sector of the Scottish economy does relatively well despite the Scottish Government, rather than because of it. It could, with a change towards lower taxes and fewer regulations, achieve greater results and therefore contribute higher revenues while spending is restrained. When that day comes where stands the argument about the union idendit is measured by price alone How then will the argument fare that we should remain in the UK because of the Union Dividend when the GERS figures allow the SNP to complain about a similarly ridiculous “Union Premium”  Unionist politicians should stop focussing on the number and start concentrating on the shared benefits of giving and receiving help amongst people that have more in common than drives them apart. They should instead talk about how the deficit is reduced and how Scotland can help the weaker parts of the Union just as we have been helped when we needed it.Brian Monteith MEP is editor of ThinkScotland.org©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"opposition parties settle on legislation to block no deal brexit","story":"Labour leader Jeremy Corby hosted fellow opposition chiefs including the SNPs Ian Blackford and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson for an hour of talks in his Westminster office, which Mr Blackford described as ldquopositive and productive.window.twttr The decision to pursue legislation that will seize control of the parliamentary agenda - allowing MPs to rule out a no-deal and potentially delay the UKs  October Brexit deadline - represents an admission by Labour that there isnt sufficient support to force a no-confidence vote and install Mr Corbyn as a caretaker Prime Minister.: Jeremy Corbyn insists Labour will do everything necessary to halt no-deal BrexitIt also means concrete action to stop a no-deal could take place as soon as MPsfrom the summer recess, on  September.In a joint statement, the leaders of Labour the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Independent Group for Change said they had \"detailed\" discussions, including hearing legal advice from Labours shadow Attorney General Shami Charkabarti that calls a threat to suspend parliament in order to force through a no-deal \"the gravest abuse of power and attack upon UK Constitutional principle in living memory\".

Ms Wishart responded to the issue of Brexit to say that it was #time for a peoples vote and time for people to work together across parties# to stop Brexit.Scottish independence was the next topic up for debate, and understandably provoked perhaps the most isive reactions of the night.Mr Scott, Mr Wills and the Green Party#s Debra Nicolson all came out in favour of an independent Scotland, while Mr Halcro Johnston, Ms Wishart and independent Peter Tait were against it. Both independent candidates, Michael Stout and Ryan Thomson, said they would wait to see what benefit Shetland could get from Scotland becoming independent before deciding how to vote, should another referendum come up.Mr Scott#s positive attitude towards independence was because, he said, # nothing  we#ll get rid of these damned Tories#.Ms Wishart wanted the audience to #imagine the chaos#Scotland tried to break up the union, citing Brexit as an example. She said the vote was supposed to be #once in a letime# and that there were better priorities for funding, such as healthcare.Mr Wills responded to this point: #which has been cut by the Tory Liberal coalition#, to audience applause.Conservative representative Mr Halcro Johnston said that #I think SNP talk about independence because its easier than talking about their failings#, and added that nobody would be surprised to find that he was against independence.I#m sorry, Tom Wills is havering. Independence will not keep Scots in, or bring us back into, the EU. EvenBritain stays in, Scotland will leave, automatically, with #No Deal#, on Independence Day and will have to reapply to join. The EU has confirmed this, in writing.Also,nothing changes, our starting budget deficit will be £. billion per annumversus the EU#s limit of about £ billion . The UK will stop paying funding that.We shall have to cut spending raise taxes by some £ billion p.a. on an annual budget of about £ billion, to satisfy the EU#s economic conditions for joining.That means we shall face years of withering austerity, just when we need to spend more to stimulate the economy.We also need to set up our own independent central bank which the nationalist think tank #The Common Weal# says will take nine years from an Indy Yes vote. So we shall be out of the EU, with #No Deal#, for at least, seven years from Independence Day.Scots are canny folk. They will not vote for such an independence prospectus.John, your oft repeated notion that an independent Scotland will start with a budget deficit of £. billionis an entire fancy. Whatdebt an independent Scotland may have to take on as a share of the current UK#s debt, in the event of Scotland becoming independent, will be a matter for negotiation and agreement . Similarly, matters such as whether, and for what fees , the rest of the former UK might be permitted to retain its weapons of mass destruction on Scottish soil will be for negotiation agreement in the event of Scotland becoming independent.I would not hold my breath waiting for their answer.Ian Scott and Tom Wills have very selective memories. The austerity cuts introduced by the last Conservative  Lib Dem coalition were in response to the mess Brown and Blair made of the British economy. The outcome of this prudent handling of the deficit was obviously popular with the British people because David Cameron’s government won an overall majority in the subsequent election. David Cameron also delivered on another election pledge to have an in out referendum on Europe. How can the SNP criticise any party for that they have never delivered on an election pledge in their le. Finally, the only racism and fascism that has come out of this by-election has been promoted by the SNP anti-English racism. The SNP are Tartan Fascists.Had it not been for the global economic crisis, and Blair#s US led wars, Brown#s finances could have seen him becoming PM. This shows the harm in getting too friendly with the US, not that there will be much of a choice for the remnants of the UK after Brexit. I won#t digny John M Scott#s final comment with a response other than to note that it is Trump and Farage that have been too close to white supremacists. Happily neither seem that popular north of the boarder. The SNP promote an inclusive civic nationalism which can#t seriously be compared to that of the far right.##and the peril of getting too friendly with the EU is being dictated to and bled dry by a Union of Socialist Republics ruled by a Germanic Franco dictator, aided an abetted by a random collection of Belgians.Best off going it alone and not being shackled up to some #superpower#, either actual or wannabe.It#s like I wasnt even there.No mention of Labours position on Brexit or Independence.

A couple of years back, the SNP#s own Sustainable Growth Commission conceded that we would start independence with a budget deficit of .% of our GDP, around £. billion per year, and proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to less than %, which just happens to be the EU#s maximum permissible limit. @Brian Hill, Ok,we are to be pernickety:The UK funds the dference between our tax revenues and what Holyrood receives from the Exchequer so we are talking about a so-called #notional deficit# that has been ongoing for many years.This is recognised by the SNP#s Sustainable Growth Commission.UK funding will cease on Independence Day and the notional deficit will become , our budget deficit.The current UK funding of £. billion equates to around £ per head of population, per year. With independence that money will have to be found where # borrowing or tax hikes # or cut from public services.#John, as Scotland is not yet independent then it cant have been running a deficit for any#, what utter nonsense. Since when did you have to be independent to go broke  Try telling that one to your bank manager.

UKIP#s Stuart Martin has not made the trip. List MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston is standing in for Conservative candidate Brydon Goodlad. The first question comes from secondary five pupil Scott Moncrieff who asks whether, after  years, the time has come for Shetland to back a party other than the Liberals.Lib Dem candidate Beatrice Wishart is the first to answer. She reflects on the party#s -year record in the isles.SNP hopeful Tom Wills says that it#s #not healthy# for a constituency to be represented by the same party for seven decades. Independent Ian Scott, standing on an anti-austerity ticket, is straight on the offensive. He says the Lib Dems have a #hugely checkered career# and references the party#s decision to go into coalition with the Tories under Nick Clegg.North Isles councillor Ryan Thomson tells the room that #the status quo is not working# and agrees with the questioner and other candidates that the time has come for change. The next question comes from Drew Manson, who asks why the SNP should be trusted. He says they #say one thing then do another# and accuses the party of broken promises over ferry funding.Mr Wills replies that the nationalists have increased funding by £ million one year, followed by . million the next. He argues that this is a #good news story that is getting better#.The candidates are now debating whether Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a #statesman or a bad comedian#. Green candidate Debra Nicolson believes he #is very dangerous# and states that the £ million a week for the NHS pledge, made during the Brexit referendum campaign, was a lie. Labour#s Johan Adamson says Mr Johnson is guilty of #complete fabrications# and says that he has charted a #reckless path# for the UK as he drags the country towards a no-deal Brexit. Mr Wills compares the Prime Minister to US President Donald Trump. He says the personality is a #distraction from what#s going on behind the scenes which is right-wing populism#. Brexit was won #on a pack of lies# he adds. The SNP candidate draws the first applause of the hustings for saying that the Lib Dem and Tory coalition made the poorest in society suffer for the #errors of the bankers# following the  financial crisis.It#s dficult to hear Ms Wishart from the back of the room here. It sounds like she says she is #not impressed# with Mr Johnson.Independent Ryan Thomson, meanwhile, goes in hard, calling the PM a #racist, liar and a xenophobe# and says that the fact he rose the highest office in the land shows #exactly what#s wrong with politics in this country#. Mr Scott says Mr Johnson is a #loathsome creature who leads a loathsome party#.#They have no respect for us. They have no interest in how we live.#He adds Tory austerity drove people into the arms of #fascists# like Nigel Farage and says the Lib Dem and Tory coalition has a lot to answer for. A smattering of applause follows Mr Scott#s assertion that the Lib Dems would happily get back into bed with the Tories#Boris comes knocking#. Groans after Mr Halcro Johnston attempts to defend Mr Johnson#s comments on Muslim women and black people with #watermelon smiles#. Almost universal applause for Mr Thomson as he takes down Mr Halcro Johnston#s argument and adds that Mr Johnson was sacked as a journalist for lying. The candidates are now discussing Scottish independence.Mr Wills says #nobody will be surprised# to learn that he thinks the time has come for another referendum on the issue. This comes after MP Alistair Carmichael accused the SNP of avoiding mentions of independence during the by-election campaign. Ms Wishart says voters were told in  that the referendum was called a #once in a letime# vote. Chair Irvine Tait says voters were told independence would mean an exit from the EU. He asks whether that entitles people in Scotland, faced with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, to another chance to vote. Ms Wishart#s response is dficult to hear.Independent Michael Stout, meanwhile, says that he backed independence in . Mr Scott says #self-determination is an essential tenet# of a democracy. He says there is a dference between independence and nationalism. #You belief the politicians at your peril#, he adds, drawing a few chuckles.Mrs Adamson says that Scotland should stay in the UK to #make it better#. #It#s an international world, why are we being so selfish #Mr Wills has taken notes on several anti-SNP points made by spectators. Responding to concerns over an independent Scotland#s wealth he argues that Scotland#s GDP is the same, per capita, as the rest of the UK without even factoring in oil wealth. Mr Thomson says that it is not the right time for a second independence referendum. #The SNP is basing it#s new push for independence on Brexit but Brexit hasn#t happened yet#, he says. Final question # should pupils go on strike to protest climate change Ms Nicolson, unsurprisingly, says #absolutely#. #It#s your future#, she tells the room, adding that the Scottish Greens are #right behind you#.Mr Halco Johnston says #yes and no#. If people are Passionate they should take action# but he has a couple of concerns, including the #impact on young people#s education#. Ms Adamson says yes. She understands young people#s frustrations and says her generation #have taken a lot# from those younger than them. #There#s things we enjoyed that are no longer there.#Mr Scott says climate change will not be #solved by a wealthy young Swedish woman [Greta Thunberg]# going on a sailing trip. The problem isn#t one defined by people#s personal choices, he says, but rather #vast multi-national companies that don#t give a toss about climate change#.#The only solution is a political move#, he adds. Mr Scott has arguably performed the best, drawing strong applause on several occasions and a few laughs too. Mr Wills and Mr Thomson also enjoyed strong support in the room and were applauded on more than one occasion.Mrs Adamson and Ms Nicolson have both spoken with passion and conviction and may have converted a few young voters. Candidates remarked on a couple of occasions #I agree with Beatrice#, but unfortunately from the back it was dicult for the press to make out what she was saying. Definitely the softest spoken candidate in the race.Mr Halcro Johnston, standing in for Mr Goodlad, arguably had the toughest time and was on the recieving end of the only loud groan of the afternoon.  raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"electoral showdown draws closer ","story":"Preparations are well in advance for this week#s by-election, with council staff readying the floor for Thursday#s electoral showdown.In all,  staff, including presiding officers, polling clerks and information officials will be on hand during this week#s vote.Twenty-eight polling places are being opened, containing a total of  polling stations.The Gilbertson Park Games Hall in Lerwick will have seven polling stations set up for , voters.In contrast, the Uyeasound hall in Unst will open its doors to  voters.Over  voters could walk through the doors of the Scalloway hall to cast their vote.

The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.Cullybackey patient Thelma Shanks from Cullybackey was referred onto the programme this year. She said: “There is a history of hypertension and diabetes in my family. “Several of my paternal aunts sadly passed away due to complications that came with the disease, and my mum was found to be diabetic following admission to hospital for routine tests. “I was born in London, but grew up in my parent country, Jamaica. I ed to the UK for good in , and my husband and I moved to Northern Ireland, where all my children were born, in . “As a nation, we from the Caribbean tend to be a bit more susceptible to diabetes than others, so it wasn’t a complete surprise to be told I was at risk of developing the disease. “I am also a trained doctor so despite having given up my profession when I had children, I have knowledge of the medical risk.“I have a wonderful busy family le. I have four children, all of which I home schooled, and of course, their needs always came before mine. “When you’re running a busy house and looking after everyone  it’s easy to forget to look after yourself. However, in  when I heard that a health fair was coming to the area I decided to go along. For a small fee they carried out multiple tests which showed I had hypertension or high blood pressure. “I decided to make an appointment with my GP who put me on a number of drugs, first Irbesartan, then Amlodipine and finally a diuretic to bring my blood pressure under control.“I realised I needed to be more careful with my diet and tried to be a bit healthier but I admit it was a bit half-hearted. TESTS“My blood sugar levels were border-line they weren’t going down but they weren’t going up either, so I thought everything was all right. I was having routine check-ups with my nurse at this stage so I was on her radar and having blood tests taken intermittently. In April  I had my regular tests done and then hopped on a plane to London. “It was my daughter’s birthday and I had decided to treat her by going away for the week. We had just made it to the hotel when I received a phone call from my nurse. “She said tests showed my sugar levels were up and I was actually diabetic, which was the wake-up call I needed. Let’s just say it wasn’t quite the luxury week that I had planned! My daughter certainly ate well, but no sugar passed my lips that trip. “Needless to say, I had the blood tests repeated soon after our , and was delighted to learn that due to my dietary sacrices, my blood sugar levels had again receded into the ‘pre-diabetic’ band.“Prior to our trip away, my doctor had called me. She said there was a new Diabetes Prevention Programme starting soon in my area being run by the Public Health Agency. She askedI would be interested and of course I agreed.“The class has  others in it and we meet on Wednesday afternoons. There are eight women and two men, and together we re-learn what we should be eating, what to avoid, and how to step up our exercise routines. “I’ve found it really helpful because everyone is in the same boat and we can share our experiences and encourage one another. “Each week we build on the goals of the previous weeks, paying attention to diet and exercise and gaining strength from each other.“I used to believe that running after a busy family was exercise enough but now I’m walking every other day, trying to increase my pace and my distance. My daughter and I often walk together and I try to keep up with her. LONG TERM“One day I managed , steps in one walk and  of those miles were uphill. I’m trying to make long term changes and make sure these become habits I’ll stick to for the rest of my le. So far I’ve lost  kg, and my exercise levels have increased signicantly too. My blood sugar levels have decreased, but more importantly I feel better physically and psychologically. “The Diabetes Prevention Programme and the team who deliver it have been amazing. I’m looking forward to seeing a new me at the end of the nine and a half month course.”Thelma was referred onto the Diabetes Prevention Programme by her GP Dr Jean McCaughern, Maine Medical Practice, CullybackeyThe practice serves around , patients that live within a six mile radius of the surgery. Dr Jean McCaughern joined the surgery around  years ago and was placed in charge of the practice’s diabetes clinic.At first she managed this alone, today she heads up this specialist clinic with the help of two practice nurses. She does this alongside her normal GP responsibilities.She said: “When I first started the clinic around % of our patients were diabetic and that included those who had both type  and type  diabetes. Today that figure has more than doubled. In  we have a prevalence rate of .%. That’s how quickly the disease is on the rise. “Often patients don’t realise just how serious the illness is. I have overheard patients saying ‘I just have a touch of diabetes’ or ‘I only have diabetes’, but it’s a serious illness which can cause deterioration of vision, contribute to heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and vascular problems which at their worst can lead to amputation.“Patients of mine have had all these problems and more. The reality is dferent to the perception and it’s only when dficulties start that people begin to understand what living with diabetes can mean. The longer you have the disease, the more likely you are to have any one of those complications.“Having diabetes presents practical problems too. In some cases the DVLA can revoke people’s drivers licensestheythey believe there is poor management of diabetes. This can include raised sugars, but more importantly sugar levels dropping and causing confusion in patients as is would be unsafe to drive.“For some people having diabetes is out of their control. Those with Type  diabetes have no choice but to manage it using medication. “For others who spot heightened blood sugar levels early, termed pre-diabetic, they have a window of opportunity to reverse or delay a diagnosis of Type  diabetes through healthy eating and exercise. That’s who the Diabetes Prevention Programme is aimed at and who it can help.“Once higher sugar levels are discovered, the earlier people can make changes and the higher the chance they have of reversing the outcome. Sometimes, it’s not about changing the diagnosis but delaying it by a decade or so. “The longer you can hold it off the longer you can hold off the complications that come with it. “It’s not all bad news though, having diabetes, whether Type  or Type , is largely manageable either by medication, treatment or diet. “Insulin, used primarily for treating type  diabetes, lowers blood sugar levels when diet and exercise alone aren’t sufficient, but the effectiveness of these medications depends on how early the disease is diagnosed and the size of the dose.“I was happy to get involved in the Programme. Having an interest in diabetes I was approached by the Public Health Agency at the operational stage to look at the programme’s viability in my area. I’m a big supporter. “So far I’ve referred around  people from the practice onto the programme which educates and empowers people of the contents of foods, the need to exercise and develop better eating patterns. “Often I’ve heard people say once they have to go on a special diabetes diet but that’s not the case, it’s just healthy eating, it’s the way we should all be eating.“As far as the success of the programme goes, it’s a little early to tell. The first cohort of people started on the programme in May and early results are positive. Certainly weight loss as a group has occurred and people have more knowledge of food, portion control and exercise.“So, there are benefits for all and for some the course is working really well. When you join the programme as a group you bond as a group, you encourage each other, you don’t want to let your group members down. “That shared experience and cohesiveness is a real motivator and works across all ages and all groups. For many the programme offers them a chance to turn a future diagnosis around and gives them the tools to change their future. “That can be le changing and what the programme is designed to do”.KEY FACTSThe Diabetes Prevention Programme is run by the Public Health Agency.It is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The Diabetes Prevention Programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.It is facilitated by health coaches who offer help and assistance to participants, helping them change their lestyle, diet and physical activity with the aim of postponing and even preventing type  diabetes.For more information on the ‘Diabetes Prevention Programmeemail your local Health Trustdiabetespreventionni@northerntrust.hscni.netst  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2094373.jpg--.jpg?1566376242000\n","title":"talent galore at music mania event","story":"Broughshane was alive with the sound of music last weekend when the Music Mania event rolled into the village.Local people were given the chance to take to the stage and show off their musical abilities and talents, both with instruments and voice.Many turned out to not only take part, but also to watch on and support those on stage.Bob Esler was the compare for the evening where there was live music on stage from pm with an open mic session and a BBQ proving popular with everyone.

With over thirty years experience in the field, he has been the head chef, first manager and then owner of the popular The Side Door restaurant, located at Febro Buildings on the Antrim Road in Glengormley for  years.Brendan grew up on the Cltonville Road until he was  years old when his parents moved to the Antrim Road. His first part-time job came in the old Lansdowne Court as it was known back in the day.Ever since a young age, Brendan was interested in the food and catering industry and decided to pursue a career in the field when he left school at . After three years at the College of Business in Brunswick Street in Belfast, he went on to complete a B-Tech qualication and an advanced catering course.Subsequent employment followed in the shape of a full-time role in the Lansdowne before spells in Belfast Castle, the Crawfordsburn Inn and Chimney Corner.But it is with his current venture The Side Door that he has made his name, establishing the -seater restaurant ever since taking over six years ago as the new owner.Brendan explained: “The Side Door is basically a family-style restaurant with something on the menu for everyone. The menu is very mainstream.“The previous owner’s menu was something close to fine dining but people were still ordering pizzas. I thought it wasn’t right so I changed the menu about a bit.“I had my own ideas and kept it mainstream to attract anybody and everybody.“The pressure was there to get bums on seats and it has worked ever since so I have no intention of changing it.”Brendan also acts as Head Chef at The Side Door and thanks to his wealth of experience, he has put his own style and spin on food.“I would cook things like lasagne, carbonara, scampi and burgers,” he added.“Everything is home-made. I am experienced enough to know what way things are cooked best and what sells well.“I used to be a sauce chef and I suppose sauces and soups are still my forte.It is still probably my favourite aspect of being in the kitchen.“I was brought up in the catering industry on a French theme which is something I still like doing, especially with some of the specials in the restaurant in some shape or form.”As for how things have changed in the industry, Brendan points to a number of ious things he has noticed over the years.“The food industry has changed massively over the years,” he explained.“Themes and customers needs and wants are like night and day now since when I started off over  years ago.“Food takes waves now, much like politics. whether Italian or Mexican themed.“There are more vegans and vegetarians than ever before but allergies is such a big thing these days. Celiac is definitely the main one and you just have to be so careful.“I probably wouldn’t have taken as much of an interest in allergies but when I found out my daughter had a nut allergy, it changed everything. It scared me.”Looking ahead to the future, Brendan reflected on what he has achieved so far at The Side Door.“Glengormley is a perfect setting. People thought I was mad taking The Side Door on with the amount of competition but my idea wasyou want to buy a washing machine and there is more than one shop available in the same area to buy it, you will still compare it, just like restaurants.“I think we stand out because we are not pretentious. Many restaurants are, in my opinion. We are not – what you see is what you get: fresh food bought from a number of dferent suppliers who I have built up a relationship with over the years. I buy the best produce that I can get but at affordable prices for customers.“I believe also in good service and to my knowledge, we are still the only bring-your-own restaurant in Glengormley.“As for the future, I am not getting any younger. I thought around two years ago about looking for a bigger premises. What I have to turn away from a Thursday to a Sunday now is scary some weeks, but I thought here was working. I decided to stay because things are good and long may it continue.“Customers keep coming back so I must be doing something right.”Brendan Rafferty is Owner, Manager and Head Chef at The Side Door restaurant in Glengormley.The Side Door,Febro Buildings,Ballyclare Road,Glengormley,BT DZ.Tel:   "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"speckled hen have got it well sussed","story":"IN a food market dominated by commercial farming, big drinks brands and unormity, the authenticity and quality yielded by do-it yourself approach is becoming all the more appealing, and there are few businesses doing it better locally than the Speckled Hen Bar and Dining Rooms.Having long brewed an exciting range of its own craft beers and ciders, the Lisburn-based establishment has taken the next crucial step towards self-suffiency by bottling its own still and sparkled water. Although a seemingly simple step, tapping into the natural springs below the bar has revealed interesting information about the geography of the area and, as owner Martin Caldwell explains, has created further links to the Speckled Hen’s -year history.“Right under our feet is the Triassic Aquer, which stretches from the Castlereagh to Black Mountain,” he said.“There has always been a well under the bar, so given that we’re filtering our own water anyway, it made sense to put in a chiller, a cooler and a carbonator to make fizzy water too.“There was originally a well there and the previous owner had tapped into it. During the winter time you can actually see little springs coming up out in the carpark. There used to be a well where our beer garden is now where they used to dip the buckets for water. The pub goes back to , so it goes back a fair while. They used to brew their own beers and everything here, so access to spring water was vital.”He continued: “It’s fantastic that a place of this age is still ing and providing hospitality and services. This used to be the old post road and was also one of the main roads to Dublin at the time, so coaches used to stop along here. It was actually alleged that Daniel O’Connell stopped here before. It would have had to have been self-sufficient. We’re essentially going back to the notion of our own self-sufficiency in terms of the supply of water as well.”The Speckled Hen started bottling its water last month, installing a new filtration system that provides fresh four-times-filtered water for its customers. The water is, of course, filtered through the rocks on its journey across the mountains that, according to Queen’s University researchers, began , to , years ago. As for the punters, Martin says they see it as a “great novelty”.“They’re getting their draft beer and now they are getting draft water, he said.“The kids come in and want cordials or juices, so now well ask themthey want still or fizzy water – they think it’s a great novelty getting the fizzy water in the cordial.”While making connections with the pub’s past, Martin and his team are also looking to the future with the installation of farming allotments that will provide fruit, veg and more for it’s kitchens in the years to come."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38421911.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/2008192-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"1000 children on waiting list yet trust returns half its funds for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She has been on a waiting list for  months for occupational therapy and we have been told we will have another year to wait.\"Ms Harron said she enquired about the cross-border health directive, where EU citizens have the right to access healthcare in any EU country and to be reimbursed by their home country.She hoped to get her daughter assessed by an occupational therapist in Donegal and claim the money back through the directive, but claimed the trust didnt reply to her letter.Ms Harron added: \"Getting a child with autism the relevant treatments and assessments is so important, because it can make the dference in your child being allocated a full-time classroom assistant at school.\"It also helps parents cope with the additional needs a child with autism has.\"The Western Trusts failure to spend the money came to light through a Freedom of Information request submitted by SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan.He said: \"We are all too well aware of the y delays in diagnoses and waits for support and help which are often explained away by the trust as a result of insufficient resources to meet the demand on autism services. However, now we have a situation where the trust actually received money to improve its performance in service for autism and it seems it has been unable to spend that money.\"From the information I have received, all other trusts in Northern Ireland havent had the same dficulty in spending the money and recruiting new staff.\"The Western Trust spokeswoman said: \"The Western Trust was allocated funding by the HSCB to facilitate the development and implementation of a new regional framework for the delivery of children and young peoples emotional wellbeing, autism and ADHD services. \"The HSCB withdrew part of the funding from the original allocation as it was dficult to recruit staff within the required timeframe. \"The trust has, however, recently appointed one band-six social worker to address the extensive waiting list for children and young people for intervention following a diagnosis of ASD.\"In relation to childrens autism services, there are  on the assessment waiting list and  on the treatment waiting list as at end of July . \"The trust apologies for theof time waiting for both assessment and intervention and is committed in its efforts to reduce waiting times and enhance service provision for children with a diagnosis of autism and their families across the Western Trust area.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37264874.ece/36493/BINARY/primarknew010.jpg","title":"chamber chief hails creative thinking shown following belfast primark inferno","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It led to many months of disrupted business for retailers and shoppers in the area after a cordon was put in place around the unsafe building. \"We all really felt it,\" he said.Read MoreClaire McNeilly: Why do we still not know how Belfast Primark fire started In October alone footfall was down % on the year before. Fast food restaurant City Picnic closed on the day of the fire and hasnt been opened since, though hopes to be open again by the autumn. Others such as Pizza Boutique struggled on for a time after the cordon was reduced, only to also shutter their premises completely.Primark opened two stores, one at the back of its Bank Buildings shop and another on Donegall Place - though it is also planning a restoration of Bank Buildings. Fashion chain Zara was closed for around seven months, thanks to its close proximity to Bank Buildings.Mr Rana said the first impact had been to galvanise organisations in the city to work together with a greater sense of urgency than ever before. \"There was Belfast City Council, then ourselves in the Chamber, then the other business-type organisations like Belfast City Centre Management and also the Department for Communities, and Translink.\"It did throw us together and resulted in a great deal of co-ordination and co-working. Its probably strengthened that relationship and added impetus to work together.\"That led to initiatives to draw people into the city centre around Christmas, such as a winter-themed slide in Royal Avenue and stalls selling fast food. And a kids play park was also installed in Castle Place.Mr Rana said: \"The animation that the council provided in the peak Christmas season meant the city was very busy, and that did attract people into the city that probably hadnt been in recently. data-dfpadtargeting\"\" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  \" title\"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \" width\"\" \"\"  Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  \"Aerial views showing the aftermath of the fire in the Bank Buildings - Primark Belfast - August th  Aerial view over Bank Buildings following Tuesdays fire.

Discussions are taking place, too, about pedestrianisation and improving public transport into and around the city. Mr Rana - whose company Andras House owns a string of hotels in the city - said the crisis of the fire had led to creative thinking. \"I would say it did stimulate new ideas to try things, which dont always work but its good to try them. \"It certainly has highlighted the importance of the city centre. When it wasnt ing we all really felt it.\"He said retail was the biggest pull into the city centre, but that the night-time economy and the drive to get more people living in it were also a big part of planning its future. And he said retail in Belfast centre - despite the well-publicised dficulties of the sector as a whole - was performing well.\"Weve had a new store, Anthropologie, opening in Arthur Street two Primark shops opening and CastleCourt Shopping Centre has a new Matalan, which does very well. \"And in Belfast, we still have our big-brand retailers like House of Fraser, Debenhams and Marks  Spencer - retailers which have closed stores in other city centres.\"And he said other parts of the city centre were being redeveloped, such as a site close to Smithfield Market and the Tribeca development around the Cathedral Quarter. The Tribeca name has attracted objections as its also the name of a district in New York. But Mr Rana said he did not object to the name. \"The name gives definition to the area and at the end of the day, the priority isnt the name but making sure development starts, proceeds and benefits the city centre.\""},{"url":null,"title":"long distance swimmer thanks belfast medics who saved his life","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

cholesterol may also be a benefit of having the odd glass of red, after an experiment on more than  twins showed an increase in gut microbiota ersity – a sign of gut health – compared to those who drank other types of alcohol.Scientists at King’s College London were looking into the effects of beer, cider, red wine, white wine and spirits on the gut microbiome, the micro-organisms found in the digestive tracts of humans.They found that the gut microbiome of red wine drinkers was more erse compared to those who had other drinks, which researchers speculate could be due to a higher amount of defence chemicals called polyphenol that act as an antioxidant.If you must choose one alcoholic drink today, red wine is the one to pick as it seems to potentially exert a beneficial effect on you and your gut microbes, which in turn may also help weight and risk of heart diseaseDr Caroline Le Roy“While we have long known of the unexplained benefits of red wine on heart health, this study shows that moderate red wine consumption is associated with greater ersity and a healthier gut microbiota that partly explain its long-debated beneficial effects on health,” Dr Caroline Le Roy, first author of the findings, said.Results from the  UK female twins who participated in the research also matched up to three other groups tested in the UK, the US and the Netherlands.However, professionals have also warned that the positives should still be weighed up against the negative impacts of alcohol.“No doctor would recommend drinking on medical grounds, as any potential benefits of red wine polyphenols should be considered alongside alcohol’s links to over  health conditions, including heart disease and cancers as identied in the Chief Medical Officer’s guidelines review,” Dr Sadie Bonace, research co-ordinator at the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A drop of the good stuff  “Polyphenols are also available from a range of other foods besides red wine.”But scientists behind the paper, published in the journal Gastroenterology, say thatpeople should choose any alcohol, red wine should be the one to go forconsumed in moderation.“Although we observed an association between red wine consumption and the gut microbiota ersity, drinking red wine rarely, such as once every two weeks, seems to be enough to observe an effect,” Dr Le Roy added.“If you must choose one alcoholic drink today, red wine is the one to pick as it seems to potentially exert a beneficial effect on you and your gut microbes, which in turn may also help weight and risk of heart disease.“However, it is still advised to consume alcohol with moderation.”Professor Tim Spector, lead author from King’s College London, added: “This is one of the largest-ever studies to explore the effects of red wine in the guts of nearly , people in three dferent countries and provides insights that the high levels of polyphenols in the grape skin could be responsible for much of the controversial health benefits, when used in moderation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"what the papers say august","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

The US voted against it.Animal advocates applauded the move, even though some felt it did not go far enough.“While it is disappointing that it is not an outright ban on trade in live elephants, the new language adds vital independent oversight and scrutiny,” said Audrey Delsink, wildle director at Humane Society International.“The capture of wild African elephants for export to zoos and other captive facilities is incredibly traumatising for inidual elephants as well as their social groups,” she said in a statement.Dozens of celebrities, including actress Judi Dench and comedian Ricky Gervais, had signed a letter to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker saying it would be “obscene for the EU to endorse snatching wild baby elephants and condemning these beautul leviathans to a le of captive misery”.Even renowned conservationist Jane Goodall weighed in, saying she was “absolutely shocked” at the idea of separating young elephants from their families and shipping them off to zoos.We view our animals as an economic opportunity, so we should sell our elephantsTinashe FarawoSome African officials, however, said the new proposal would deny them some much-needed cash and they should be free to do what they wished with their elephants.“The Government has been pumping out a lot of money for conservation with no real , yet our Government has competing social needs,” said Tinashe Farawo, spokesman for Zimbabwe Parks and Wildle Management Authority.“We view our animals as an economic opportunity so we should sell our elephants.”Mr Farawo said Zimbabwe, Botswana Namibia and other southern African countries would meet for consultations following the CITES meeting.“We cannot continue to be hamstrung and told what to do with our resources,” he said.“We cannot continue to allow powerful countries and NGOs to set the agenda when the elephants are ours.“We have too many of them so selling them should not be a problem for anyone.“Why should we continue to impoverish our people when we have the resource ”"},{"url":null,"title":"nerve visual gallery close doors ebrington","story":"The Nerve Visual Gallery at Ebrington is set to close at the beginning of next month, the Derry News has learned.The announcement will come as a great disappointment to art lovers in the city who have frequented the gallery over the past number of years and will be a loss to the Ebrington site.When it first opened in  it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.However, at the weekend a spokesperson for The Executive Officeconfirmed: “The Nerve Centre has operated a gallery in a section of the Creative Hub Building   on the Ebrington Site for three years and gave notice that they intend to close the gallery on  September .“The Executive Office is currently considering options for the section occupied by Nerve Gallery.”Located in the former army barracks at Ebrington, the Nerve Centre developed a series of major visual arts commissions with partners including - Now, National Museums NI, The Fondation Gilles Caron, Gallery of Photography Dublin, Ultra Lab Madrid and Matts Gallery London.Exhibitions have shone a light on pivotal moments in Northern Ireland’s history such as the Civil Rights movement and the Troubles.The Lost Moment exhibition looked anew at the Civil Rights movement fty years on from the marches and peaceful protests that immediately preceded the Troubles. It featured dramatic images of the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights march in , alongside work on the Northern Irish civil rights struggle, from the first march in August  to the Battle of the Bogside in .Picturing Derry brought together some of the most iconic images from the Troubles and the most recent exhibition explored anxieties around Brexit which were part of a series of cross-border projects.Local artists were also regularly showcased at the gallery.Earlier this year plans to build a whiskey distillery in Ebrington fell through.But last week positive news emerged of plans to build two Grade A office blocks and a -apartment retirement village at the Waterside site.The Nerve Centre was contacted for comment regarding the gallery’s closure but did not respond at the time of going to press.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"new cain documents highlight unresolved political issues","story":"A new batch of documents added to Ulster University’s CAIN archive demonstrate how important issues affecting Northern Irish politics twenty years ago remain pertinent today.The newly released material provides a valuable insight into the period between -, mostly notably in relation to the Brooke Mayhew talks.In addition, it also charts developments in Anglo-Irish relations for these years, ongoing discussions around ious political and security matters, as well as important issues such as fair employment, the Irish language and community relations.The Brooke Mayhew negotiations took place to secure “a new, more broadly based agreement” which would replace the Anglo Irish Agreement.On the  March, , the first roundtable negotiations, excluding Sinn Fein, took place in an attempt to end the political stalemate in N.I., and continued through to November .Although they appeared to achieve little the Brooke Mayhew talks were the first to have \"three strands\", the relationships within Northern Ireland, between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and between London and Dublin.

As the official archive for Northern Ireland, one of PRONI’s many responsibilities is to receive government records from the early s onwards and to make them available for researchers.“The development of ‘PRONI Records on CAIN’ therefore provides people with an opportunity to gain access to a selection of material from the official files, that to date, chart the period from  to .“Looking ahead both CAIN and PRONI hope to continue this work to enable researchers to examine the events and personalities involved in the evolving ‘peace process’ of the s which culminated with the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April .”‘Political stalemate’In terms of the latest documents, one of the most striking features of this material is that some of the issues which are so prominent today are the same ones which confronted politicians and policy makers back then.“For instance the search for an end to the political stalemate in Northern Ireland was dominated by a series of long, drawn out discussions – often referred to as the Brooke Mayhew talks of -. Whilst these were ultimately to end in failure they did leave behind an important template that was to be used at a later date,” Mr Lynn added.Dr Michael Willis, PRONI Director, has welcomed the publication of previously secret records through a continuing partnership between PRONI and Conflict Archive on the INternet .He said: “PRONI’s mission is to identy, preserve and promote public access to Northern Ireland’s archival heritage.“This latest addition of official documents to the CAIN website enhances the opportunity to view and read key documents from the time.

Then I got a local engineer to sandblast it and paint it so that is was like new and that cost another few thousand.ldquoThe rest of the cost will be spent on the build and the fit out inside. I reckon that even after we live in it for a while, it would still retain some valuewe wanted to sell itwe decide to travel again or rent it out. I see the cost as the equivalent to three yearsrsquo rent and itrsquos money not wasted as we still have something at the end of it.The tiny home concept mdashnormally one bed studio-style homes mdash has become popular for people looking for a simpler way of living in locations that they can change and without tying themselves down to massive mortgage.Michael, who is from Whiterock, and Alex, who is from Saintfield, discovered the concept while travelling and living in a small van in New Zealand for a year.ldquoI had been aware of tiny houses before we went to New Zealand and over there it is really popular, explained Michael. ldquoThey really are everywhere. Seeing how people live in these tiny houses inspired me that it could be done here too.ldquoWe lived in one of them during our time in New Zealand and loved it. It did simply our lives and it was a bit more sustainable which is a big thing is for us.ldquoWe donrsquot like the idea of renting for the next few years or being tied down to a mortgage and this allows us to be flexible, plus it is a bit adventurous.The couple, who first began to date after getting together at their leaving formal at Down High School, have designed their home with a galley kitchen with sitting area, a small shower room and loft bedroom in a building that is six metres long by . metres wide and . metres high.The house should be finished in time for Christmas and is kept near Lisbane where the couple try to work on it every day.Michael, a design engineer graduate, and Alex, who graduated in textile and design, are both working part-time jobs at the moment in order to devote themselves to the build.Michael said: ldquoWersquove done all the work ourselves in order to save money and to gain more skills. The exterior is nearly finished so we will be moving on to the interior soon.ldquoRegarding installing the utilities, some have pretty easy solutions and some are more dficult. As we would like some flexibility as to where we can park it, we donrsquot want to plug into mains electricity or the sewerage system, so the shower will be a standard shower with an instant water heater. Any grey water from the sink or shower will be probably be handled by some kind of natural filtration.Michael and Alex donrsquot yet know where they will site their home when it is finished but hope to place it on land owned by friends, or to rent out a field.They say that part of the reason to build their tiny home is financial, but also down to the way of le that living in such a small space brings with it.Michael said: ldquoWe like to do something more meaningful with our money and prefer travel experiences. We would rather not spend loads of money on a sofa mdash we would prefer to go travelling.He added: ldquoI would love to convert a camper van and go around Europe. I really donrsquot see the sense of buying up stuff and would rather have experiences that I would remember more.The couple want to have a cosy feeling to their home but not something too modern.Like caravans or boats, space is at a premium in a tiny house and Michael has designed stairs up to their loft bed so that extra storage can be built in.ldquoWe donrsquot have that much stuff which is good. Often when people do move into these small houses they find it dficult to get rid of a lot of stuff, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call for play park upgrade  ","story":"MOTHERS in Ballynahinch are demanding that immediate improvements are made to the play park in Hillfoot Crescent.The women claim that due to vandalism and a lack of maintenance, the play facility is in dire need of an upgrade and is not fit for purpose to serve the needs of local children.The members of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association also say that the play facility is long overdue for some general weed tidying up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council which is responsible for it.A large group of women and children held an open meeting at the park last Thursday and invited local councillors to attend to see at first hand the poor state the park has declined into.Rowallane councillor Terry Andrews told the mothers, grandmothers and children that Hillfoot Crescent was one of three local parks due to be upgraded by the council within the next two years.However, while Ursula Jess, secretary of Hillfoot Crescent and Windmill Residents Association, welcomed the news, she said that the association would still be pressing for some interim improvements.ldquoItrsquos good to hear that a new play facility upgrade is supposed to be in the pipeline but we need something done between now and then, she said.ldquoWe urgently need it upgraded as therersquos no summer seats and parents and minders either have to stand or sit on the grass to keep an eye on the children and itrsquos not good enough. The seats were burnt one by one years ago and never replaced sowe were to get summer seats between now and the upgrade, it would be helpful.Mrs Jess said that Hillfoot Crescent got a Lottery grant in the late s to install the park and over the years broken equipment has not been replaced.She added: ldquoItrsquos a massive park with a lot of potential. We still have some tyre swings, a climbing frame, a slide and baby swings. There used to be a basket ball hoop but that is away now.ldquoItrsquos all been down to vandalism and general wear and tear.

The remaining minutes of the half were played at a hectic pace with some tremendous play on show.Sheila McGrath and Greville handed Westmeath a three-point lead before Mallon and Dowdall swapped points as the game entered added time.However, Down had the bit between their teeth and three inspirational scores from Finnuala Carr, Aoe Keown and Mallon brought the sides level at - to - with time practically up.Westmeath were not to be denied a first half lead and a converted Greville free sent her side in at the break with a hard-earned - to - lead.The second half was every bit as competitive with Down again dominating the share of possession, but they continued to struggle to put that advantage to good use.Frees from Greville and Mairead McCormick and a magical strike from McGrath suddenly had Westmeath - to - ahead after  minutes.Down went for broke and minutes after Mallon and McCormick exchanged points, the predatory Saoirse Sands struck with venom when she netted after taking control of a Fionnuala Carr free.Paula Gribben reduced the deficit to two points before Greville and Mallon again exchanged scores. Mallon was unerring in front of the posts and with four minutes remaining she left a point in it after scoring from play.Unfortunately, McCrossan took advantage of two more Down wides from frees when she gave her side a - to - lead with two minutes of added time played.Sara Louise Carr kept the pot boiling with a th point for Down, but this was the last score of the game as the referee blew the final whistle on the resumption of play.Down: M McNally, N Kelly, A Savage, C McGilligan, C Rocks, D Magee, K McMullan, A Keown , P Gribben , S L Carr , D Savage, S McCartan, N Mallon , C McGourty, F Carr .

The works proposed will aim to upgrade the existing frontage and use hardstanding to provide a more formalised parking arrangement.Planners say the existing land is to be regraded and resurfaced with low walls and have confirmed that external lighting also forms part of the proposal, with the current entrance set to be widened and new gates installed. Hedge planting is also proposed to help screen some of the activities to the rear of the site.Signicantly, the planning papers spell out clearly that the new parking at the front of the site will be laid out for vans and staff vehicles, not refuse vehicles. Planners also insist the application does not represent a change of use to the site.The papers continue: ldquoThe application proposes to relocate staff parking to the site of the formerly demolished council administrative building and use the other side of the car park for some additional fleet vehicle parking, with designated parking spaces marked and circulation routes displayed through the site.ldquoThe proposal will not impact any more signicantly in terms of residential amenity as to what is already there at present.Planning Committee members will also be told today that as part of the sale of council land at the Strangford Road to the Education Authority that there will be a two-hour daily traffic restriction over the use of the existing main fleet access to the site for local authority vehicles.Council vehicles will not be permitted to use the entrance between .am and .am and between .pm and .pm, with planners explaining this clause was ed into the contract of sale with the Education Authority on the grounds of child safety to ensure students could not be injured by council vehicles.In addition, planners say it is anticipated that most council HGVs and bin lorries will be off site by .am, but that a few may not be, requiring the need for an access through the site to the Strangford Road. This access will also be used by vehicles whichto the site between .pm and .pm when the existing fleet entrance will be closed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to review traffic light order in Downpatrick  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to conduct a major review of traffic light sequencing in Downpatrick town centre.The call comes in the wake of increasing concern about problems in a number of areas which is leaving residents and pedestrians frustrated.The call for the review of the traffic lights timing has been issued by South Down MLA Colin McGrath who revealed that he has received what he described as ldquomultiple reports from people on the issue.The MLA said some have raised concern about the lights operating out of sequence, explaining that this can be ldquoincredibly frustrating for pedestrians and road users.Confirming that he has raised the issue with roads officials, Mr McGrath said he wants the exercise to focus on where problems have arisen.ldquoIt is unfortunate to see this particular element of our roads network fall short of the standard which we have come to expect, said Mr McGrath. ldquoIt is essential that when the review is carried out that any necessary works are completed as soon as possible.ldquoThere is a great deal of frustration in the Downpatrick area due to the delay in completing the necessary regeneration works at Irish Street, a project which has still not reached its conclusion.Mr McGrath argued that this level of frustration ldquocompounds and unfortunately results in drivers and pedestrians taking chances at crossings and lights.He added: ldquoUnless the ious statutory bodies are willing to work together to ensure these issues are dealt with, then we are only going to rumble from issue to issue without seeing adequate road provision provided for the thriving community hub that is Downpatrick.ldquoThe people in the community want these issues addressed and have made that very clear to me..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ruth Maguire’s family raise £9%2C000 for Newcastle RNLI  ","story":"THE family of Newcastle woman Ruth Maguire, who drowned in Carlingford Lough in March, have raised pound, for Newcastle RNLI in her memory.Newcastle RNLI was involved in the search for the mother of four along with other search and rescue agencies and recovered her from the lough after an extensive search.Staff at the leboat station were incredibly moved by the kind gesture from the  year-oldrsquos loved ones and have expressed their deep gratitude for the substantial donation.Following the tragedy, Ruthrsquos family carried out numerous fundraising events between Newcastle and Belfast.

However, just hours before it was due to start someone painted lsquoIRA on the wall in front of the nearby Pilson Hall.The spokesperson revealed that when the graffiti appeared last week they contacted a specialist cleaner to have it removed and were prepared to meet the financial cost. However, the businessman agreed to do the work for free.ldquoNo one in Mount Crescent or Bridge Street wants sectarian graffiti. It does not reflect the good people who live at this part of the town, the spokesperson declared.ldquoWe were left disgusted at what happened given that we are working hard to promote our area and secure new investment, just like many other community groups across Downpatrick. This despicable act was not done in our name and we condemn those responsible.ldquoWe are not prepared to let those responsible have a negative impact on the good people, from all religions and races, who live at this part of Downpatrick.

We trust that our community collective colleagues will recognise that the sentiments expressed in the recent graffiti is not what we are about.ldquoWe work with people from across the town and liaise closely with them on a regular basis.

We cannot emphasis enough that what happened was not done on our name and we condemn those behind this. We will not let people tarnish the work that we are doing or the good name of the Mount Crescent and Bridge Street area.ldquoWe hope the fact that we took steps to contact a specialist cleaner when we were made aware of the graffiti speaks volumes about our views on this matter. Those responsible are clearly not aware of what we are about and the respect we have for all our neighbours across Downpatrick.The spokesperson added: ldquoWe will not allow what happened to drive a wedge between us and others. If those responsible hoped the finger of blame would be pointed at us, they have failed.

Their unique wing structure along with their light weight enables them to go to places that other land-based mammals would find unmanageable. Their limbs are highly modied for flight, so they find it dficult to move around on the ground. When they are not flying, they rest hanging upside down from a tree branch using their sharp claws.Roosting in caves, trees or draught-free buildings each species has their own preferred roost, usually near its main food source. They eat insects including moths and midges, so are considered a very important natural pest controller. Echolocation aids their navigation when hunting for prey on the wing at night. Bats are creatures of habit, ing to their favourite roost each year..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Northern Ireland has eight species of bats, all protected by European law. Apart from being incredible little animals to watch, bats are a valuable part of nature across the UK and can be a very welcome visitor to our gardens. Sadly, though, they’re becoming increasingly rare in the UK. Like so many other animals, a gradual loss of habitat and roost sites are making numbers decline at an alarming rate. As old trees are cut down, buildings disturbed and mines filled in, bats are left with very few natural roost sites. Making sure our gardens are thriving insect-rich feeding grounds for bats can help a lot. And, just as we do with nestboxes for birds, we can also provide alternative roost sites for bats in the form of bat boxes. You can find out more information on how to help bats via our website . So while our Belfast Bat Walk is done for another year, we have another fantastic event taking place in Enniskillen in September. What better date for a ‘Bat Detectives’ guided walk than Friday the th  It’s a great opportunity to learn more about bats, to see and hear them and immerse yourself in their world. There will be a short introductory talk about bats followed by a night-time walk using bat detectors to identy the dferent species living in Enniskillen town centre. Tickets are £ per adult, £. per child and free for all RSPB members.

The boys will start Banbridge Tech next month.Sean’s mother Lisa commented: “They were very brave and I’m very proud of them, but it could’ve went terribly wrong just as quickly.The Mid Sussex streets

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted.

The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Now in its st year, the region’s longest established listing of company performance provides insight on the accomplishments of Northern Ireland based companies, either Northern Ireland registered or where a signicant proportion of their business is transacted in the province. The  edition of the Top  incorporates analysis of figures filed at each companies year end and posted at Companies House and primarily relate to financial periods ending in late ,  and . SUMMARY Sales have grown to £.bn from £.bnwhich is a growth of .%. While extremely encouraging this result needs to be tempered with the fact that profits for the top companies decreased by nearly % to £.m. Shareholder value for the Top  companies increased by .%. Revenue sales Sales revenue is the income received by a company from its sales of goods or the provision of services. The performance of the Top  showing a .% sales growth to £.bn is exceptional in what is a dficult trading environment and period of uncertainty for the provinces businesses. The Brexit question came to the fore on June ,  so all the financial figures shown in the listing have come post the referendum and in essence since the suspension of the Assembly in January . Moy Park continues to hold sway with the highest turnover, currently £.bn, up from £.bn previously – snapping close at their heels is WR Barnett Ltd . Next in the listing are a number of high fliers, LCC Group Ltd and John Graham Holdings Ltd. John Graham Holdings Ltd, which trades as Graham, is another privately owned company based in Hillsborough and specialising in building and civil engineering projects – Graham posted annual sales of £.m in its latest financial accounts up from £.m – an increase of some .% year on year. One of the perennial high performers of the Top  showed a signicant decrease in sales dropping it from a position last year of  to a position this year of . Fane Valley Co-Operative‘s sales decreased from £m to £.m – this is a result of their change in ownership of Linden Foods.

Cranswick Country Foodshas risen to  in the listing posting impressive sales growth of %. Profitability Since the Ulster Business Top ’s inception in , we have identied the top companies by measuring turnover, while also accepting that both profitability and tangible shareholder value are also key measures of performance. This year has seen a drop in profit margin for the Top  companies from a margin of .% to .% with total profits now sitting at £.m compared to £.bn for the corresponding companies in their prior year. Northern Ireland Water Ltd has retained its position as the most profitable business within the listing, posting pre tax profits of £.m on a turnover of £.m a margin of .%. Northern Ireland Electricity Networks Ltd is second most profitable with pre tax figures of £m against a turnover of £.m . While the reduction in profitability of the Top  is disappointing this can be tempered by the fact that a number of the companies made signicant losses during the last filed figures recorded for the compilation of the listing. Short Bros PLC after currency adjustments filed losses of £.m, CaterpillarLtd posted losses of £.m, Northern Ireland Transport Holding Companyfiled losses of £.m, EP Kilroot Power losses of £m and Dunnes Stores Bangor Ltd losses of £m. The level of losses across the Top  listing is unprecedented with the  companies that posted losses amounting to £.m. Tangible net worth Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the net worth of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as s, patents, goodwill and intellectual property. Tangible net worth is a simple calculation of a company’s total tangible assets minus the company’s total liabilities. A business’s tangible net worth provides a snapshot of your financial situation at this point in time.

Six of the companies within the Top  have liabilities that outweigh their assets. Increasing the tangible net worth shareholder value is of prime importance for the management of a company.
