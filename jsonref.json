This was a private visit, and did not count as an official engagement.After a day to catch her breath, the hard-working Queen met a host of guests at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday, including David Beckham and Sir Lenny Henry, for the Young Leaders Awards Ceremony.Looking suitably floral in a green dress, she appeared alongside Prince Harry and Meghan.On Wednesday, she hosted the High Commissioner for Tonga, the ambassador from Zimbabwe and other foreign dignitaries.

They have three grown-up daughters. Lesley says:Since buying our five-metre bell tent three months ago, it’s been the star attraction in the garden of our detached home overlooking the River Trent.We enjoy throwing parties and the bell tent is an extension of our social life. We’ve fallen in love with it!Cone-shaped with a supporting pole, it is made from waterproof cotton canvas.It cost £600 from local business Bell Tent Boutique and is worth every penny. The distinctive shape makes it pretty to look at, and I wanted it to be a beautiful and luxurious haven inside. So, I’ve had a ball choosing cushions, throws, rugs and low Indian-style wooden tables.Ahead of Wimbledon I’ve stocked up on strawberries and champagne, which I intend to devour with my friends in the tent while our husbands watch the World Cup in the house.When my girlfriends visit, we’ll be found, as the sun goes down, lounging with a glass of Prosecco, putting the world to rights. The perfect place for a perfect evening.

She lives in London.I’ve had lots of bell tents, but this Luna version from boutiquecamping.com is my favourite.It’s five metres in diameter and so spacious inside I can stand up and walk around.And it’s a doddle to put up, which means I can take it to any festival in the UK or abroad, as well as friends’ festival-style weddings.I simply lay the tent out on the ground and attach the guy ropes, then once the central pole’s in position it’s easy to put the ropes and pegs into place.Ten minutes is all it takes, but I’ll happily spend a few hours accessorising. My house is full of the accessories I’ve picked up. I love to plan different themes depending on the occasion and the season.  Becka Cutler, 32, redecorates her bell tent depending on the occasion and takes it away with her if she goes camping I once pitched my previous bell tent on the beach in Ibiza with friends, having taken it on the plane as extra baggage. On the beach, I decorated it with a Scandinavian theme, with faux Reindeer hides, plus furry cushions and throws.With this incredible heatwave, I couldn’t resist buying a load of new accessories with a tropical feel, including potted palm trees, cool rugs and botanical printed cushions. I’ve also got my eye on some ornamental flamingos.Overnight, I want a great night’s sleep and a little luxury! So, I basically build a bedroom in my bell tent with a blow-up double bed, cosy pillows and throws, low tables to put lanterns on and fairy lights, too.I love to invite my girlfriends to the tent when it’s pitched in my garden, and we’ll just kick back with some girly cocktails and nibbles or a barbecue.          The inside of Becka\u0027s tent is stylish and filled with accessories. She also takes it to the beach          Becka puts a double bed inside the tent if she wants to take it away but fills it with decorations at home  It\u0027s perfect for my hen party...             Helen\u0027s family are farmers and have 1500 acres.

Charlotte Cleveley of Stratford on Avon who is a fruit farmer and has a seven metre bell tent in her seven acre apple orchardCharlotte Cleveley, 40, is single and runs the family farm near Stratford-upon-Avon. She says:On Sunday afternoons, with a book, I love sneaking over to my 7.5m bell tent — the largest UK version available — for a snooze.The tent is pitched in our seven-acre apple orchard, where I have three smaller ones, and it is my oasis of calm. I paid £800 for it from Bell Tent Boutique and it’s so vast you can wander around. It accommodates several double beds.Recently, the tent was the venue for my cousin’s 13th birthday sleepover party with 12 of her giggling girlfriends.When I looked into buying a tent I found bell tents are the new thing, so I bought four. It means friends can sleep over in comfort and I can also rent them out to ‘glampers’.Each one has a chandelier suspended from the roof with LED tealights — you can’t have naked flames in a tent — and they are bedecked with bunting.Last month I had friends over from Australia and we had a wonderful time camping beneath the trees and laughing about old times. I love to lead friends through the trees to my gigantic tent because the general reaction is: ‘Wow!’It really is a magical spot.

Independent presidential candidate Jaime Rodriguez, known as \u0027El Bronco,\u0027 is pictured in AprilThis time around some supporters again fear that dirty tricks could be employed to keep him from office, even as authorities and outside observers say the possibility is remote.\u0027The chances of not winning exist because of the system that has in place for years,\u0027 said Antonio Lopez, a street vendor in Mexico City and Lopez Obrador supporter.Such fears have a basis in history. For most of the 20th century, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, dominated virtually all aspects of politics and held the presidency uninterruptedly for seven decades until 2000, and then regained it in 2012.Mexico\u0027s presidential election has been marred by violence this year, with Al Jazeera reporting that 534 politicians have been attacked since campaigning began in September and 130 politicians have been killed.More than 20,500 homicides have also been reported since the beginning of the year, with May coming in as the deadliest month with 4,381 murders.   Reporters without Borders and its Mexican partner, Propuesta Cívica, said that at least 45 journalists have complained to authorities about physical attacks, which were recorded between January and May.   \u0027It\u0027s very important for the Mexican authorities to sell specific measures of protection for journalists covering the electoral campaigns,\u0027 Emmanuel Colombié, the head of RSF\u0027s Latin America bureau, told Al Jazeera.           Mexico\u0027s presidential candidate Ricardo Anaya, standing for the Mexico al Frente coalition of the PAN-PRD-Movimiento Ciudadano parties, speaks to supporters\u0027As a reminder, Mexico is still one of the most dangerous countries in the world for the press. In 2017, 11 journalists were killed for direct connection to their activities. So far this year, we\u0027ve had five cases of journalists killed in the country,\u0027 he added. Dead people voting, vote-buying, theft or burning of ballots, threats of violence, rigged counting, particularly in remote areas - over the years it\u0027s all been seen.Obrador has run a values-based campaign extolling an anti-corruption message and a promise to clamp down on the deadly violence that has run roughshod over the country for years, mostly caused by ruthless drug-cartels.In 1998 opposition candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas had a narrow lead in early returns when the system for tabulating votes was said to have \u0027collapsed,\u0027 purportedly due to failure of phone lines which were used to report the count.After it came back online, the election went to ruling party candidate Carlos Salinas.For many, the moment exemplified the lengths to which the PRI would go to keep itself in power.

In 2010, more than 90 million minutes of phone calls was made, yet this was just 35 million last year.Despite the dramatic fall in the number of minutes which landlines were used for, more homes now have landlines in 2010 due to the need for broadband.Telecoms analyst for Enders Analysis, James Barford said: \u0027Because of the pricing structure most people have to have a landline to get broadband - but younger people often don\u0027t even plug in a handset.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/29/17/4DBF520800000578-5898791-image-m-22_1530291031847.jpg","title":"Danny Dyer calls David Cameron t t Brexit chat Corbyn Good Evening Britain","story":"Host Piers Morgan (second left) described the panel (Danny Dyer left, Jeremy Corbyn second right and Pamela Anderson far right) as the \u0027most weird and eclectic mix of people ever amassed on television as he chaired the debate with co-host Susanna Reid (centre)  Theresa May (pictured in Brussels today) defended the right of Danny Dyer to call David Cameron a \u0027t***\u0027 for calling the Brexit referendum and then resigning when he lost.Asked if Mrs May agreed with Mr Dyer\u0027s assessment, the PM\u0027s spokeswoman said: \u0027Much like columnists and others, people who appear on broadcast and newspapers are perfectly entitled to their opinion.\u0027  She added: \u0027We have always been clear that Brexit is a challenging process, but we have made good progress on it.\u0027  Heartbroken family of Love Island star Sophie Gradon stay...\u0027Has Nigel gone to the hairdresser and asked for a Donald...Share this article    Viewers took to Twitter to hail the TV hardman an unlikely political hero          Danny Dyer\u0027s straight talking on Brexit struck a chord with viewers who said he talked more sense than politicians           The EastEnders star spoke for many across Britain when he said that people have no idea what is going on with Brexit           Viewers hailed the actor, whose daughter Dani is starring in Love Island, as their hero          Many Britain have grown fed up as over two years after they voted for Brexit is remains unclear what the future deal will look like           Alex Lowe was among the many viewers who took to Twitter to praise Danny Dyer for slamming David Cameron           Tina Diprose was among the critics tweeting \u0027Danny Dyer being a \u0027hero\u0027 for incorrect information is what\u0027s wrong with politics\u0027It came as the Brexit talks remain in deadlock after months of Cabinet in-fighting about what Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU should look like. Dyer became an unlikely political hero after he tore into the former Tory leader as he appeared on the TV show to talk about football, Love island and politics.He said: \u0027Let\u0027s go back to this whole Brexit thing, when you\u0027re judging them because they don\u0027t know what Brexit is.\u0027Who know\u0027s about Brexit?

She lives in London.I’ve had lots of bell tents, but this Luna version from boutiquecamping.com is my favourite.It’s five metres in diameter and so spacious inside I can stand up and walk around.And it’s a doddle to put up, which means I can take it to any festival in the UK or abroad, as well as friends’ festival-style weddings.I simply lay the tent out on the ground and attach the guy ropes, then once the central pole’s in position it’s easy to put the ropes and pegs into place.Ten minutes is all it takes, but I’ll happily spend a few hours accessorising. My house is full of the accessories I’ve picked up. I love to plan different themes depending on the occasion and the season.  Becka Cutler, 32, redecorates her bell tent depending on the occasion and takes it away with her if she goes camping I once pitched my previous bell tent on the beach in Ibiza with friends, having taken it on the plane as extra baggage. On the beach, I decorated it with a Scandinavian theme, with faux Reindeer hides, plus furry cushions and throws.With this incredible heatwave, I couldn’t resist buying a load of new accessories with a tropical feel, including potted palm trees, cool rugs and botanical printed cushions. I’ve also got my eye on some ornamental flamingos.Overnight, I want a great night’s sleep and a little luxury! So, I basically build a bedroom in my bell tent with a blow-up double bed, cosy pillows and throws, low tables to put lanterns on and fairy lights, too.I love to invite my girlfriends to the tent when it’s pitched in my garden, and we’ll just kick back with some girly cocktails and nibbles or a barbecue.

I paid £800 for it from Bell Tent Boutique and it’s so vast you can wander around. It accommodates several double beds.Recently, the tent was the venue for my cousin’s 13th birthday sleepover party with 12 of her giggling girlfriends.When I looked into buying a tent I found bell tents are the new thing, so I bought four. It means friends can sleep over in comfort and I can also rent them out to ‘glampers’.Each one has a chandelier suspended from the roof with LED tealights — you can’t have naked flames in a tent — and they are bedecked with bunting.Last month I had friends over from Australia and we had a wonderful time camping beneath the trees and laughing about old times.

They describe him as someone who was rude and irate when questioned, and who dismissed or made light of their complaints of being in severe distress and pain. He has been found guilty by the New South Wales civil and administrative tribunal of professional misconduct for failing to adequately inform patients before performing surgery on them, and of needlessly performing surgeries such as hysterectomy and fallopian tube removal on women who could have been treated with painkillers and bed-rest. One of his patients died.But some of the hospitals where Gayed worked have no record of his employment. This is alarming given Gayed is now the subject of two separate inquiries investigating his treatment of women ning five public hospitals.What is known about Gayed is that he graduated from Egypt’s Ain Shams public university in 1976. The University’s faculty of medicine is one of the most highly-regarded medical training faculties in Egypt. A ledger of graduates held at the faculty’s registrar’s office shows Gayed obtained the second-lowest grade of ‘good’ out of a range of four grades ranging from ‘pass’ to ‘excellent’. Records held by the Egyptian medical syndicate show Gayed registered as a doctor in 1977. Egyptian doctors seeking to work abroad sometimes require a certificate of good standing from the medical syndicate and permission from the ministry of health, depending on the requirements of their workplace. No record of such a letter exists on Gayed’s file with the syndicate. Syndicate records show while he was licensed to practise medicine in Egypt with heavy supervision in a residency or similar program, he would have been unable to practise as a specialist or a GP without a masters degree or further specialisation, which it has no records of him obtaining.By 1982 Gayed was working overseas. Records from the General Medical Council, responsible for registering doctors to practise in the UK, shows Gayed registered there in 1982. The council has no record of where in the UK he worked or if he received further training there.By the 90s Gayed had moved to Australia where he trained to become a specialist gynaecologist and obstetrician. He graduated as a fellow of the Royal Australian College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1993. While records of the first years Gayed worked in Australia are scarce, it is clear that within several years complaints and concerns arose about his work in his chosen speciality.Gayed began working as a locum or visiting medical officer in rural and regional towns in NSW. He often consulted patients in private rooms and performed procedures on them in the public hospitals of those towns. Gayed did stints at Kempsey District hospital between 1990 and 2003, Grafton Base hospital between 1994 and 1995, Cooma hospital between 1994 and 1999, and Manning Base hospital between 1999 and 2016. He filled in for several months as an obstetrician and gynaecologist at Canberra hospital in 1996, and also did some work at Mona Vale hospital on Sydney’s northern beaches between 2002 and 2007. But the bulk of his career was spent in regional communities.An investigation was first launched into Gayed in 2000 relating to his time working in Cooma, where general practitioners and midwives who worked with him there and in Canberra expressed concerns about his dismissive and uncaring treatment of women. While the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists confirmed it was subpoenaed for information about Gayed at the time, it no longer has records of what specific information was requested, or the outcome of any investigation. The ACT health department said it could find no records of Gayed as an employee, including as a contract medical officer or a visiting medical officer. Several senior doctors spoken to by  Australia have confirmed, however, that he did work at Canberra Hospital as a locum in 1996, and that midwives especially had concerns about him. During this time, he performed ablation surgery on his own wife, which involves surgically destroying the lining of the uterus, at the John James private hospital. She was transferred to Canberra hospital’s emergency department after suffering complications.But the bulk of complaints surrounding Gayed relate to his most recent employment as a visiting medical officer at the Manning Rural Referral hospital in the small town of Taree on the mid-north coast of NSW. He consulted at his private clinic in Taree and at private rooms in Dee Why, a northern Sydney suburb 316km south. He appeared to return to his home at Collaroy Plateau, near Dee Why, on weekends, and regularly worshipped at the St Rewis Coptic Orthodox church. Although staff at the public hospital and patients had serious concerns about Gayed ning more than two decades, Gayed’s career did not start to unravel until 2015, when one of his patients made a complaint to the Health Care Complaints Commission. The complaint was made by a woman who nearly died after a procedure Gayed had performed. She mentioned to investigators that Gayed had paid for a friend of hers to get an abortion after he failed to detect she was pregnant before performing a procedure on her that would likely have harmed her unborn child.This complaint sparked a wider investigation that found seven women received inappropriate medical treatment from Gayed between 2011 and 2016, and that many of them did not give informed consent to major surgery. The investigation found he needlessly removed the uterus of a woman who could have been treated with painkillers and bed rest, and that he removed another woman’s healthy right fallopian tube. After details of their cases were published by  Australia, dozens more women came forward describing traumatic surgeries they did not want or did not need at the hands of Gayed. Some alleged they were left with serious infections and nerve damage. Manning hospital scanned Gayed’s ablation records and found ten further patients who Gayed had performed ablation on despite the presence of hyperplasia – which can be an early sign of cancer – in the uterus. Ablation should never be performed on women with hyperplasia because scarring from the procedure can mask cancer growth and trigger the development of cancerous cells. One of Gayed’s patients died after he failed to tell her that tests revealed she had hyperplasia. He performed ablation on her and did not follow- up or refer her to a cancer specialist. The hospital found Gayed had performed hundreds of ablations on women, at a far higher rate than other gynaecologists.Dr Osama Ali, the clinical director of Manning hospital who is now reviewing the cases of more than 45 women who have made further complaints to a hotline the hospital established for Gayed’s patients, said he “struggled to understand why” Gayed performed needless procedures on women.“It’s a question for him to answer, why he’s operated on all these ladies,” Ali said. “Whether it’s a matter of money, increasing his skills, recklessness, a lack of insight... I can’t tell. They’re all possibilities.” He said there was never any indication that Gayed was mentally unwell.The NSW Medical Board is now also under review for its responses to ‐ and management of ‐ historical complaints about Gayed. has tried to contact Gayed to comment on the accusations against him, but he has not returned calls. His current whereabouts is unknown.Adham Youssef contributed additional reporting from Cairo."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3727ae04854d1bde658fbb79cf4fbbf5bd2d15c6/340_1710_4438_2663/master/4438.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85e7ca88019772ccdd194f04c825167f","title":"david sedaris short man my size squeak","story":"Elfin, diminutive, bonsai-size – the 5ft 5in author has heard it all. What’s the big deal?I was sitting around the house one evening when I suddenly wondered how tall Rock Hudson was. It’s not often that I think of him, but I’d recently rewatched the movie Giant, so he was on my mind.One of the many things I’ll never understand is why a search on my computer might be different from a search on someone else’s – my sister Amy’s, for instance. She’ll go to Google, type in “What does a 50-year-old woman look like?” and summon pictures I can’t believe they allow on the internet, unlocked, where just anyone can see them. I don’t mean Playboy shots but the sort you’d find in Hustler. It’s as if she’d asked, “What does the inside of a 50-year-old woman look like?”I did the same search and got pictures of Meg Ryan and Brooke Shields, smiling.I said to my boyfriend Hugh, “This computer of mine is so… wholesome.”I said it again after looking up Rock Hudson. “How tall is…” I began, and before I could finish, Google interrupted me with “…Jesus? You want to know how tall Jesus was?”Well, OK, I thought. But it’s Rock Hudson I was really curious about.Were Amy to open her laptop and type “How tall is…” Google would finish her question with “…Tom Hardy’s dick?” With mine, though, it’s Jesus, who they’re guessing came in at around six foot, which is ridiculous in my opinion. What are the odds that he was both tall and handsome? Is he described that way in the Bible? In some of the early northern European paintings, Christ looks like you flushed him out from under a bridge, but in Sunday-school books and the sorts of pictures they sell at Christian supply stores, he falls somewhere between Kenny Loggins and Jared Leto, always doe-eyed and, of course, white, with brown – not black – hair, usually wavy. And he always has a fantastic body, shown at its best on the cross, which – face it – was practically designed to make a man’s stomach and shoulders look good.What would happen, I often wonder, if someone sculpted a morbidly obese Jesus with titties and acne scars and hair on his back? On top of that, he should be short – five foot two at most. “Sacrilege!” people would shout. But why? Doing good deeds doesn’t make you good-looking. Take Jimmy Carter. Habitat For Humanity didn’t do a thing for those tombstonesize teeth of his. Or at least I remember his teeth as seeming pretty big. I should Google Image them. On Amy’s computer.At five-five, I never give much thought to my height until I do. Whenever I come across a man my size – at the airport, say, or in a hotel lobby – I squeak the way a one-year-old does when it spots a fellow baby. It’s all I can do not to toddle over and embrace the guy. Whenever I do say something – “Look, we’re the same height!” – it turns weird, though I don’t know why. Don’t fellow Porsche drivers acknowledge one another, or people walking the same breed of dog? With small straight men, I often get the feeling that they don’t want their shortness pointed out, that it’s like saying, “Look, I have a bald spot, too!”I want to ask the guys my size if, like me, they find themselves being hit up for money a lot. Hugh and I will walk through one city or another and, while he’ll advance down the sidewalk uninterrupted, I’ll get stopped again and again. “Can you give me a dollar? A cigarette? Whatever’s in that bag you’re holding?”It’s not that I have a particularly friendly face, so I have to assume that my stature has something to do with it, especially when the request becomes a demand. “I said, ‘Give me a dollar.’”“Would you be talking to me this way if I were taller than you?” I want to ask the 10-year-old with his hand out.I know that short straight men sometimes have it hard when it comes to finding a girlfriend, but I thought that for people like myself – “pocket gays,” we’re sometimes called – it was no hindrance. In retrospect, I guess I wasn’t paying much attention. The Washington Post has a regular feature in which they send two people out on a date and then check in to see how it went. Recently the couple was gay. Both stood more than six feet and listed in their “Deal-Breakers” box “short men”. They did not, I noticed, exclude white supremacists or machine-gun owners.Who wants to date you anyway? I wondered, scowling at the photos.I’m not one of those short men who feels he got shafted. Yes, it’s hard to buy things off the rack, but that’s what tailors are for. I fit easily into aeroplane seats. I can blend into crowds when I want to. Added height would be of no more use to me than a square head, so who needs it? I like knowing how tall other people are, though, especially celebrities. That’s why I Googled Rock Hudson, who, at six foot five, had every right to appear in Giant. He towered over his co-stars in that picture, but with other actors it’s hard to tell.I once asked someone in the movie business how tall Paul Newman was. This was back when he was still alive and before I had the internet. “Oh,” said this woman who’d worked with him on Mr \u0026amp Mrs Bridge, “he’s tiny.”“What does that mean?”“He’s a shrimp,” the woman said. “In photos he seems average enough, but in real life you practically need a microscope to see him.”“So he’s, like, the size of a flu germ?”“Just about,” she said. “I’d put him at around five-nine.”“I’m four inches shorter,” I told her, “so what does that make me?”“Well… you know,” she said.Before I learned to never, under any circumstances, read anything about myself, I’d occasionally stumble upon an interview I’d given. Then I’d recall the journalist who wrote it and mistakenly wonder what his or her writing was like. In Australia a few years back, I was surprised when a woman I’d very much enjoyed talking to described me as “bonsai-size”. This didn’t offend me. Rather, I was taken aback. She might have been an inch or two taller than me, but it’s not like I came to her knees or anything. I’ve been called “diminutive” as well, and “elfin”, as if I sleep in a teacup.A few years ago I opened a paper in Ottawa and saw that the journalist I’d spoken to the day before had described me as “slight and effeminate”. Really? I thought. The first adjective seemed fair enough, but the second one threw me. I know I cross my legs a lot, but I don’t think my walk is especially ladylike. I don’t wave my hands around when I talk or address anyone as “Miss Thing”. In the end I decided the word was more about him than it was about me. But isn’t it often that way?It’s one thing for someone to describe you in print, to go through several drafts and, after careful consideration, choose the adjective “Lilliputian” over, say, “pint-size”. It’s another thing when they blurt it out. “You horrible little man,” an Englishwoman once said after I’d written something she didn’t like in her book. In 1987, while I was home for Christmas, my sister Tiffany got into a fight with my sister Gretchen. I came in at the very end, just as it was breaking up, and when I asked what was going on, Tiffany said, “Why don’t you go back to your room and write some more about being a faggot?”How long has that been in there? I wondered. It’s scary the things that come out when you’re mad at someone. Some years back at a small airport in Wisconsin, a TSA agent ordered me to take off my vest. “I’ve been wearing this for three weeks,” I told her. “Every day I’ve traveled to a different city, and this is the first time I’ve been asked to remove it.”The woman was maybe 10 years older than me, which at the time would have put her in her early 60s. Her dyed hair was cut short and was carefully styled in a way that made me think of chocolate cake frosting. “I want it off now!” she barked.“It must be nice to hold such an important position,” I wanted to say as I started undoing the buttons. Then I thought of how snobbish that sounded and was ashamed of myself. Here I was, angry, and my first instinct was to attack her job – her class, really. Have I always been this person? I wondered as I walked through the archway in my stocking feet. What does it mean that my second option, “I’m so glad you’re not my grandmother,” wasn’t much better?I later wondered how this woman might have described me and realized that all she needed to say was “the jerk in the vest”. Actually, in this context, the word “jerk” is unnecessary. As with “the guy in the white boots”, I think it’s already implied. I mean, really, a vest! What was I thinking? It wasn’t the kind that came with a suit but rather a “worker’s vest”, modeled on one from the nineteenth century, with pockets for all my mule-skinning tools.She also might have described me as “the gay guy”. While this doesn’t bother me, I don’t think of it as the cornerstone of what I am. Given all my current options, I think I prefer “the little guy”. Who wants to waste his time bothering a person like that? So tiny. So inconsequential.

I like to think that while I may have misgivings about much of what the current technological revolution is visiting on us, I yet manage to resist that dread ascription “luddite”. It’s one Bridle also wishes to avoid but such is the pessimism about the machines that informs his argument, that his calls for a new “partnership” between them and us seem like special pleading. As futile, in fact, as a weaver believing that by smashing a Jacquard loom he’ll stop the industrial revolution in its tracks.At the core of our thinking about new technology there lies, Bridle suggests, a dangerous fallacy: we both model our own minds on our understanding of computers, and believe they can solve all our problems – if, that is, we supply them with enough data, and make them fast enough to deliver real-time analyses. To the Panglossian prospect of Moore’s Law, which forecasts that computers’ processing power will double every two years, Bridle offers up the counterexmple of Gates’s Law, which suggests these gains are negated by the accumulation in software of redundant coding. But our miscalculations concerning the value of big data are only part of the computational fallacy Bridle also believes it’s implicated in our simple-minded acceptance of technology as a value-neutral tool, one to be freely employed for our own betterment. He argues that in failing to adequately understand these emergent technologies, we are in fact opening ourselves up to a new dark age. He takes this resonant phrase from HP Lovecraft’s minatory short story, “The Call of Cthulhu”, rather than the dark ages of historical record, although the latter may turn out to be a better point of reference for our current era. Lovecraft’s new dark age is, paradoxically, a function of enlightenment – it’s the searchlight science shines into the heart of human darkness that brings on a crazed barbarism. Bridle’s solution is to propose “real systemic literacy”, alongside a willingness to be imprecise – cloudy, even – when it comes to our thinking about the cloud.I’m not against this indeed, I often think that in a world crazed by its sense of certainty, the best way to stay calm is to allow yourself the luxury of doubt. But while I can see it as making good stoical sense for the inidual, I’m not sure it’s sufficiently rousing to prepare humanity, en masse, to cope with what’s coming down the steely, preprogrammed track. Bridle offers us techno pessimists plenty of examples to worry about. Some – such as death by slavish adherence to GPS navigation systems, and the woeful effects of the computational fallacy – I was already familiar with but others did give me novel heebie-jeebies.I hadn’t bitten down on the fact that the very heat generated by the internet itself is a strong factor in global warming, which pretty much nixes any view that a more wired world will be a more sustainable one. Nor was I aware of the increase in a phenomenon known as “clear-air turbulence” (although really, it speaks for itself), which may well ground a lot of commercial aviation by the middle of this century. And while I may have known at an intuitive level that the Syrian conflict had an environmental dimension to it, Bridle is the first person I’ve read who authoritatively labels it as a resource war, provoked by drought. Meanwhile, those hot and powerful secret government computers are being used to speciously survey us (he makes a convincing case for the complete uselessness of CCTV systems), while with their spare processing capacity they try to crack the prime-factoring encryption system that’s vital for online privacy and commerce.That the US National Security Agency has already cracked some of the more commonly used prime number factors was, again, news to me. And I don’t think of the fake variety: for Bridle isn’t just a purveyor of the armchair jeremiad, who sits there blowing filter bubbles – he does fieldwork as well on our hideous and looming fate. I particularly enjoyed his inquiry into the weird and wobbly realm of British airspace and the link between drone programmes and so-called “plausible deniability” – the invisibility cloak for so much of our rulers’ dabbling in the dark arts. But perhaps the strangest and most unsettling aspect of the coming new dark age is the emergence of machine intelligence.Here Bridle makes an excellent and possibly original point: we’re accustomed to worrying about AI systems being built that will either “go rogue” and attack us, or succeed us in a bizarre evolution of, um, evolution – what we didn’t reckon on is the sheer inscrutability of these manufactured minds. And minds is not a misnomer. How else should we think about the neural network Google has built so its translator can model the interrelation of all words in all languages, in a kind of three-dimensional “semantic space”? I’d wondered why it was that Google Translate had massively improved – moving from being a reliable provider of nonsensical silliness, to, well, an effective and instantaneous way of translating. The problem is, we have a general idea how the program is doing it – but it can’t tell us exactly and, as Bridle observes, this is tantamount to transgressing the first of Isaac Asimov’s famous Three Laws of Robotics – for if we’re in ignorance of what our robots are doing, how can we know if we’re being harmed?Intelligent computer systems are already menacing us with weird products devised algorithmically and offered for sale on Amazon, as well as bizarre and abusive “kids’” videos, which are mysteriously generated in the bowels of the web, and uploaded by bots to YouTube. Bridle borrows Timothy Morton’s modish conception of the “hyperobject” as a way of discussing our inability to apprehend the totality of the risks embodied in such vast phenomena as machine intelligence and global warming – but I’m not sure that acknowledging the ungraspable nature of anything really helps us to grasp it.Bridle looks to so-called “centaur chess” as a way forward for our wetware: computers may now effortlessly beat the grandest of masters at the game, but one of the defeated, Garry Kasparov, has developed a fight-back method, in which humans partnered with computers can indeed regain the podium. On this basis, Bridle argues, it’s possible to conceive of a new kind of “ship” of our frazzled planet and its poisoned wells, one in which we all work together. This seems Pollyanna-ish as much as Panglossian to me – I’m more struck by Nicholas Carr’s observation, in his takedown of the coming era of self-driving cars, The Glass Cage, that our inability to grasp the emergent techno realm may be a function of our having devised tools that do away with our need to use tools.Most of us already float free from the world of making, doing, extracting and refining – and observe it indolently and imperfectly through the scumbled lens of the cloud. We carry on ditching single-use plastic, and ordering stuff from Amazon, and giving our personal information away promiscuously, not, I’d argue, because global warming and AI are too big to grasp, but because we understand only too well that real change could only be effected by a great mass of iniduals. And that, as Bridle acknowledges, is an impossibility, given the new technologies atomise rather than fuse our social formations.Still, no doubt once the microprocessors malfunction and the pumping system splutters to a halt, we’ll hopefully pick up pretty much where we left off before the Enlightenment – or possibly the Renaissance. One thing about the old dark ages was that they only seemed dark in retrospect, once the dread weight of state power had been reimposed. I bet there were plenty of people besides the Goths (and the Visigoths for that matter), for whom the fall of the Roman empire was a cause for celebration. I realise this isn’t a popular view. And I expect many readers will find Bridle’s perceptive and thought-provoking book terrifying rather than enjoyable – but then as I implied at the outset, I’m very much of the glass half- empty type."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420e127c6be46401f29a4ba10a5dbda6c26ffabe/22_128_1977_1186/master/1977.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acdffef022f7c58dd0eb9b030f7b16dc","title":"seamus heaney family ireland icon jet sitter jet setter","story":"Ahead of a Dublin exhibition of the poet’s archive, the Heaney family explain how they put together a new collection to reflect his life as a husband and father, as well as a Nobel laureateIn 2011, when Seamus Heaney announced that he would donate his papers to the National Library of Ireland (NLI), it was a source of much pride, and a little relief, for the library. There had been some speculation that the archive would go to Harvard, where Heaney had taught for many years. When the day came for the papers to be delivered, “I think the director of the library presumed there’d be a van and minions”, recalls Heaney’s son Michael. “But there was Dad carrying the boxes. He’d put them in the back of the family car and brought them round himself. It was all done very casually, but there was also a weird sense of momentousness, so much so that it felt right for us to have a drink to mark the occasion with my brother, Christopher, afterwards.”The episode is emblematic of Heaney’s status in Ireland as a figure who is not only hugely revered for his creativity and intellect, but also loved for being approachable and down to earth. Two years later, when Heaney died unexpectedly aged 74, his family learned just how much he had meant to people, and not just in Ireland. “I was utterly taken aback by the response,” says his widow, Marie. “And I wondered whether he would have been, too. But there he was, above the fold on the front page of the New York Times, with a story about Obama and Syria down the side. It was something extraordinary to experience alongside our shock and our grief.”Heaney’s funeral was shown live on Irish TV and the cortege was given police outriders. Mourners ranged from the Irish taoiseach and president to Bono and Shane MacGowan. “It was in effect a state funeral without the military,” Marie says. All over the country there were books of condolence and the family received thousands of letters and cards. “They all had some personal connection that they wanted to share,” recalls their daughter, Catherine. “People still come up and tell me stories about meeting him and how much it meant to them.”Nearly five years on from Heaney’s death, the family have gathered to discuss two major events that will commemorate his life and work: an exhibition of the NLI Heaney archive in a new cultural space in the grand 18th-century Bank of Ireland building in Dublin, and the publication of a new anthology of his work, 100 Poems (Faber).Surprisingly, there isn’t a single-volume selection of Heaney’s poetry. He had expressed a desire for a “really focused collection”, and an idea for 75 poems for his 75th birthday was mooted. Now the family have completed the job for him, choosing a selection that runs from “Digging”, the 1965 poem by which the son and grandson of farmers boldly announced his intention to set out on a literary career – “I’ve no spade to follow men like them.  Between my finger and my thumb  The squat pen rests.  I’ll dig with it” – to a poem written for his granddaughter just 10 days before he died.Catherine took on the coordinating task “using a very unpoetic spreadsheet”, and 70 or so poems quickly selected themselves. “I cannot tell you how many readings I attended,” says Marie. “And while he never gave exactly the same one, there was certainly a core of poems that he returned to.” Aside from his best known work, all the family have poems written for them, from love poems to Marie to one recounting the morning Catherine was born a “slapped palpable girl” presented to the poet. Many other less obvious poems also meant a great deal to him, and can cast a new light. “‘Helmet’, for instance, is a lovely poem”, says Catherine, “if not one that everyone would necessarily know. But it was an actual physical object in our house, which also links to 911 as a salute to the firemen.” The haiku “1.1.87” – which reads in its entirety: “Dangerous pavements.  But I face the ice this year  With my father’s stick.” – is in, “because we all remember the time when Dad did his knee in. He slipped on ice while in Harvard in late 1986, and for a while it was a big part of his, and our, lives. But later in the year his father died, and it was after that he wrote the poem.”While the Heaney children grew up with his work, by a quirk of the curriculum they didn’t study him at school. It was only when in the US for a semester that Catherine had the bizarre experience of having to answer an exam question about a poem written by her father about her grandmother.Heaney wasn’t particularly hands on with his own children’s school work, but did his bit for the grandchildren. Christopher remembers him reading a Dr Seuss book. “He was really working to make it come alive, but also mouthing over to me as he read: ‘Damn bad rhyming.’ He also wanted to get his red pen out for some of Julia Donaldson’s metre.”But he did give Catherine a few pointers about his beloved Latin before she started secondary school. The family laugh at his habitual use of Latin, and pig Latin, phrases around the house, with “sanctus fumus” (holy smoke) a particular favourite. And so it was no surprise that his last communication to Marie was a text from hospital, minutes before he died, saying “noli timere” (don’t be afraid). Michael recounted the story in his funeral address, and not long afterwards a large mural by the graffiti artist Maser appeared on the gable end of a house in Dublin. A new Maser artwork – an installation that picks up on the ideas of flight, uplift and birds in Heaney’s poetry, will greet visitors to the exhibition.NLI director Sandra Collins says that when Heaney donated his papers he indicated he would welcome an exhibition. However, “he specifically said that he didn’t want to ‘put out Yeats’, who already has a longstanding exhibition,” says Collins. The new Bank of Ireland space, to be opened next week by the Irish president, allows for the literary titans’ work to be displayed for at least the next 10 years in their own venues. The Heaney show will be free to the public and is expected to receive 100,000 visitors a year. “He threw nothing away and his papers are already our most consulted archive.”The exhibition combines archive exhibits and multimedia features. Visitors will hear Heaney reading “Digging” while looking at the original New Statesman proof of the poem, and the letter from Faber confirming publication of his debut collection in 1966, Death of a Naturalist. It then progresses through broadly chronological themes. “Excavation” recalls the soil, the bog and peat of Heaney’s rural upbringing, as well as the Iron Age “bog bodies” that prompted some of his best known poems.In the “Creativity” section sits his desk from the attic office that overlooked Dublin Bay and Howth Head. Heaney described it as just “a slab of board on two filing cabinets”, explaining that he “liked the makeshift nature of the arrangement. I always had a superstitious fear of setting up a too well-designed writing place and then finding that the writing had absconded.” Manuscripts in this section include the poem “Trout”, which was literally written on the back of an envelope.The section on “Conscience” sets Heaney against the backdrop of the Northern Ireland Troubles, as well as his other engagements with social justice and global politics such as “From the Republic of Conscience”, written for Amnesty, and “The Cure at Troy”, which was written with Nelson Mandela in mind. This section also reflects Heaney’s struggles with the ethical question of how does a poet properly live and write, and how to speak about things without being a spokesperson. It was a fine line to tread and Marie confirms that he “really was torn a lot of the time. He was a nationalist by birth, and by inclination, but that nationalism was being hijacked in a way he detested. He got stick from both sides, and was threatened.”The last section of the exhibition is about Heaney as a public figure, especially after the Nobel prize in 1995, and one of the closing exhibits is a video of Croke Park stadium, where two days after his death an 80,000 crowd for an All-Ireland Gaelic football semi-final broke into spontaneous applause to mark his memory. “It is hard to think of another creative and cultural figure who had that sense of belonging to a country,” says Katherine McSharry of the NLI.“We were all very aware other people thought they knew him as much as we did,” Catherine says. “That was the way he moved through the world. He was very approachable and friendly and genuinely focused on the person he was talking to at the time. And he managed to balance the two pretty well in that he was always just Dad at home. But in hindsight we realise how many pieces he must have cut himself up into in order to do his civic duty, his poetic duty, his family duty and everything else.”Always an enthusiastic and expansive letter writer – and then a dogged user of fax to the extent that Faber kept an old machine in their rights department solely to receive communications from him – his writing tone changed as time went on. “They became more business-like,” says Christopher, “more and more began with an apology for his slow reply and ended with him saying he was writing from an airport lounge or was going to catch a plane the next day.”Marie says that he always said he was “more of a jet-sitter than a jet-setter, but I would sometimes be quite angry about the demands made on him. I saw how he was sort of frightened to go on holiday because he knew he would face sacks of mail when he came home. I felt he could have spent a lot more time at his poetry. That said, he did a prodigious amount as it was, not to mention the criticism and teaching.”And the way his work has entered the culture remains a remarkable testimony. The Heaneys are not the only family with strong associations to these poems. There seem to be few Irish weddings at which “Scaffolding” is not read, and few funerals that don’t feature “Postscript”. Every Irish child will know “Mid-Term Break”, written by Heaney about being taken out of school when news came of the death of his three-year-old brother. “For years he didn’t read it in public,” says Marie. “Maybe because his parents were still alive. But towards the end he introduced it and I once remember him say he was going to read it, and seeing a man in the audience reach over to hold his wife’s hand. I assume they too had lost a child. There are countless examples of how the poetry has entered the everyday lives of people and some of the ways the work connects is very touching indeed.”Although he was 74 when he died, there is still a sense that his life was somehow cut short. “So it did comfort me,” says Marie, “when I heard that Auden had once said that no true artist died before they have said what they had to say. And I think he did manage to say what he had to say.” She is also aware that Heaney’s affable and benign presence was a part of the work’s appeal, sometimes giving poetry that could be quite dark a more celebratory tone. “But now in his absence the poems will have to stand alone,” she reflects. “And that is exactly what he would have liked.”• Seamus Heaney: 100 Poems is published by Faber.

Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies had way outsold my previous books even before the shortlist. But after the wins, overseas deals multiplied rapidly and the effect bounced along to my backlist. So your previous career is recast, and all your work re-evaluated – both in a marketing sense, and a literary sense.The prize has been nothing but good to me, but I can see that it might be destabilising. Big opportunities open up. It would be possible to spend years floating around the world showing off, and to become a professional winner instead of a professional writer. I imagine also that panic could strike. Luckily for me, I was held safe, because I was committed to a trilogy. So neither in 2009 or in 2012 did I have to ask myself, “What do I do now?”Having been a judge as well as a contender, I know about the vast burden of reading, the chancy and nervous nature of the process, and how much depends on the dynamics of the final meeting. It may be skill that gets you to the shortlist stage, but we winners should remember that we have had a bit of luck, too. It’s important to get back to your desk, sit down in a spirit of humility, and – if you aim to flourish after the prize – learn all over again how to fail.1969:\u0026nbspSomething to Answer For by PH Newby1970:\u0026nbspThe Elected Member by Bernice Rubens\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspTroubles by JG Farrell1971:\u0026nbspIn a Free State by VS Naipaul1972:\u0026nbspG by John Berger1973:\u0026nbspThe Siege of Krishnapur by JG Farrell1974:\u0026nbspThe Conservationist by Nadine Gordimer\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspHoliday by Stanley Middleton1975:\u0026nbspHeat and Dust by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala\u0026nbsp1976:\u0026nbspSaville by David Storey1977:\u0026nbspStaying On by Paul Scott1978:\u0026nbspThe Sea, the Sea by Iris Murdoch1979:\u0026nbspOffshore by Penelope Fitzgerald1980:\u0026nbspRites of Passage by William Golding1981:\u0026nbspMidnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie1982:\u0026nbspSchindler’s Ark by Thomas Keneally1983:\u0026nbspLife and Times of Michael K by JM Coetzee1984:\u0026nbspHotel du Lac by Anita Brookner1985:\u0026nbspThe Bone People by Keri Hulme1986:\u0026nbspThe Old Devils by Kingsley Amis1987:\u0026nbspMoon Tiger by Penelope Lively1988:\u0026nbspOscar and Lucinda by Peter Carey1989:\u0026nbspThe Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro1990:\u0026nbspPossession by AS Byatt\u0026nbsp1991:\u0026nbspThe Famished Road by Ben Okri1992:\u0026nbspThe English Patient by Michael Ondaatje\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspSacred Hunger by Barry Unsworth1993:\u0026nbspPaddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha by Roddy Doyle1994:\u0026nbspHow Late It Was, How Late by James Kelman1995:\u0026nbspThe Ghost Road by Pat Barker1996:\u0026nbspLast Orders by Graham Swift\u0026nbsp1997:\u0026nbspThe God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy1998:\u0026nbspAmsterdam by Ian McEwan1999:\u0026nbspDisgrace by JM Coetzee2000:\u0026nbspThe Blind Assassin by Margaret Atwood2001:\u0026nbspTrue History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey2002:\u0026nbspLife of Pi by Yann Martel2003:\u0026nbspVernon God Little by DBC Pierre2004:\u0026nbspThe Line of Beauty by Alan Hollinghurst2005:\u0026nbspThe Sea by John Banville2006:\u0026nbspThe Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai\u0026nbsp2007:\u0026nbspThe Gathering by Anne Enright2008:\u0026nbspThe White Tiger by Aravind Adiga2009:\u0026nbspWolf Hall by Hilary Mantel2010:\u0026nbspThe Finkler Question by Howard Jacobson2011:\u0026nbspThe Sense of an Ending by Julian Barnes2012:\u0026nbspBring Up the Bodies by Hilary Mantel2013:\u0026nbspThe Luminaries by Eleanor Catton2014:\u0026nbspThe Narrow Road to the Deep North by Richard Flanagan2015:\u0026nbspA Brief History of Seven Killings by Marlon James2016:\u0026nbspThe Sellout by Paul Beatty2017:\u0026nbspLincoln in the Bardo by George SaundersI’ve always believed that literary prizes should be for the encouragement of the young, and the consolation of the old. In the middle stretch, you should just get on with it. So winning the Man Booker in my mid-60s was indeed a consolation – also a relief (I’d been shortlisted in each of the preceding three decades), but mainly a simple pleasure. I knew there was no danger of it changing the way I might write, and little (I hoped) of it going to my head. My old friend Ian McEwan warned me a few days afterwards: “By the way, you’ll find that from now on you’re no longer ‘the novelist Julian Barnes’ – you’ve been transformed into ‘the Booker prize-winning novelist Julian Barnes’.” This has indeed proved the case, but it’s hardly much of a burden.The highlights of that evening in 2011? A kind friend assuring me as I sat down to dinner: “We’ll love you just as much if you don’t win.” (And me asking her jauntily two hours later, “So do you love me more now?”) My (female, British) publisher jumping into my lap a few milliseconds after the announcement. My (male, American) publisher instantly tapping into his iPhone instructions to up the print run for the forthcoming American edition. Then a general soppy warmth towards everyone in the Guildhall: the judges, my fellow shortlistees, waiters, interviewers – even the journalist overheard before the press conference boasting to a chum that “I’m going to ambush him with The Martin Amis Question”. Nothing could shake my absurd, if logical, good humour. I was overfamiliar with the downside of not winning the Booker, and could see no downside at all to finally winning it.It was an evening with especially good flower arrangements in 2000, the year I won. I’d been nominated for The Handmaid’s Tale (too feminist), Cat’s Eye (too provincial) and Alias Grace (too colonial), and it seemed that I was in the Beryl Bainbridge category – always a bridesmaid but never a bride. In fact she and I had a contest going, who could be nominated the most without winning? When I actually did win, my first thought was “My new shoes are too tight”, because now I would have to walk in them to get photographed and so forth.I probably shouldn’t have said that my earliest literary influence was Beatrix Potter – however true – but as I wasn’t expecting to win, I had no speech prepared. I was of course thrilled and grateful, but also I was simply relieved: I would not have to return to Canada to a reproachful but gleeful media chorus of “Atwood Fails to Win Booker”, as if it were a horse race. It’s much more like Best Pumpkin in Show: the pumpkin does nothing.If there’s such a thing as a Man Booker experience I’ve drunk deep on it. Overlooked, infuriated, longlisted, shortlisted, victorious, overjoyed. I lost friends when I won. Not for winning but for reneging, as they saw it, on my earlier infuriation. Naive of them. If you are angry with a prize that doesn’t seem to value the sort of novels you write you are bound to change your tune when it does.I got lucky with the judges – three women and two men of rare discernment and a sense of humour. Of course I thought myself deserving, but justice is no more than the dice rolling in your favour. Losing had been equally arbitrary.Winning opened doors I thought were shut forever. Overnight, offers came in from foreign publishers, even publishers in Israel who until then had largely ignored my work on the grounds, they told my agent, that it was too Jewish.How Jewish is too Jewish? There’s an argument that the fathers of the novel are Homer and the Old Testament, the Old Testament being responsible for the jokes. That being the case, all novels are Jewish in the disputatious, dialogic sense. If I didn’t expect The Finkler Question to win – and my mother was so convinced it wouldn’t I suspect she went to William Hill and bet against it – that was because I feared it was too overtly Jewish. Which goes to show you never know. Thus my only advice to aspirants to the prize: don’t try to write a Man Booker book. Leave it to the dice. And remember to be graceful in victory. We need all the help we can get.One of the most useful things said to me after the Man Booker came from my medical sister, who looked at me with a cool, diagnostic eye and said, “I usually advise people not to make any major decisions until six months after a life changing event.” I didn’t know my life had changed, I just knew that it was hard to get back to the desk. This was not part of the fantasy of the night, of course. I saw the cameraman lining up a shot on me and thought he was aiming at Ian McEwan, who was sitting over my left shoulder. When the announcement came, I expected a name, but the chairman of the judges read out the title of a book, and it took me a long second to realise that I had written this book. I told all this to a local audience in Dublin the other day and they just loved it: the fantasy of being the chosen one is incredibly strong. But if I am proud, it is of one fact: The Gathering is not just one of the minority of books written by a woman to claim the prize, it is also one of the very few to have a female narrator – perhaps five out of the 50 – and I am happy to have beaten those odds.When I was shortlisted for Illywhacker in 1985 I had never read in public in my life. I was terrified that I would win and therefore have to make a speech. For two days I calmed myself by imagining Doris Lessing or Keri Hulme would win. That worked, for my nerves, and for Keri Hulme as well.When, three years later, I was shortlisted for Oscar and Lucinda I was a different man, not quite ready to punch the air or throw myself on the floor, but confident I would not lose my voice if called on to speak.What I said is fortunately forgotten but I accepted the nice cheque and slipped it in my rented tux. It was only after this, when I had the money in my pocket, that I discovered there was something ahead, more overwhelming than a speech.Oscar and Lucinda had been my fourth publication. I had already done many interviews, I thought. I had been photographed more than was decent. But nothing in my previous life prepared me for what followed. I mean my body had known nothing like these apocalyptic flashbulbs, relentless probes, strobes, questions left, right and over there. I was over the moon. I said I was. I was proud. I said that, too. Others were proud, my whole country even. What did I feel? What did I think? Was I happy? In those hours of media triumph and celebration, while my publishing life changed for ever, the cruellest trick of all was how numb I felt. I had to wait three days, for a stranger to hail me in the arrivals hall of Sydney airport, to really feel the thrill: “Good on you, mate. Well done.”I really didn’t think I was going to win. So much so that I didn’t even write a speech. I was so convinced another book was the winner that right before the announcement I set off to the bathroom, only to be met by two near panicking members of the dinner staff who had run after me. They marched me right back to my seat. The journalist beside me knew I had won and tried to impress on me that I really should write a speech, to which I politely but firmly said no.I was stunned when Michael Wood called my name. You really do slip outside yourself for a second, the way you do with any extreme experience, whether fear, pain, joy or heartbreak. I bumbled through a speech where I think I mentioned my father way too much, and then told people all the reasons why my book was not easy. I wonder if “not easy” referred more to the writing of it than the reading of it.Hilary Mantel wrote a brilliant and hilarious article about not winning awards, which I had read at least three times, mostly in an attempt to get accustomed to not winning. I watched clips of Maggie Smith playing an actor who did not win the Academy award. Because honestly, I never win anything. You try not to be bitter about it, but who are we fooling? “It was an honour to be nominated” can sound as hollow as you think it would.Except that it’s not hollow. No disrespect to the winners at all, but my most surprising reading experiences have come from the shortlist (Monica Ali, for example) and the longlist, (Timothy Mo, for example). So I had come to a quite beautiful moment of acceptance that I was about to join some truly esteemed company. But then I won.Does the winning author ever know the result before it’s officially announced? Not in my year, though there was a clue: the cameras seemed to be focusing more on the winning table. I remember saying to my publisher, “I think we’ve done it!” After that, my memories are a blur of radio and TV interviews and a bank of cameras with flashing blue lights and voices calling out of the darkness, “Look this way!” “Over here!” You feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights.Winning the Booker changes everything. In its power to transform a career it’s more like winning an Oscar than another literary prize. I was always aware of the luck element. A different set of judges might well have chosen another book. The question is, how do you react to your sudden (though shortlived!) fame? Embrace it, wallow in it or run away from it as fast as you can? I ran. As soon as I could, I went home and settled down to being the unsuccessful author of the next book. Though even that wasn’t easy. You’re always aware that the next book will receive more critical scrutiny than any previous book has done and that can be inhibiting. But even sitting in front of a blank screen tearing my hair out I was always grateful to have won.In recent years I’ve become more aware of a downside to the Booker prize-winning label. Too many intelligent, enthusiastic readers take it as a sign the book will be above their heads, and yet many of these books – the shortlisted as much as the winners – are brilliantly accessible. “Give it a go,” you want to say, “You never know, you might be missing a good read.”On the day of the award in 2005, I flew into London from Philadelphia at 6am. I had long before arranged to be in America at that time, as no one, especially myself, had the slightest expectation that my novel would even reach the shortlist. When it did get on, it became imperative that I attend the award dinner, in the fear that if they knew I would not be coming the jury would take offence – though even the notion that I might win made everyone put on a straight face and try not to laugh.I came back to the UK alone, with a return flight to New York arranged for the next day at 10.30am – bad taste for a loser to hang about any longer than necessary. But what, I wondered, could I possibly do with this day, a whole day, on my own in London? I determined that I must not drink – I had made a great mistake in that regard when I was on the shortlist in 1989 – so I simply strolled about the city in the October sunshine, looking in the shop windows at all the things I would no more be able to afford tomorrow than I was today.As the afternoon grew late, and the dreaded dinner hour approached, I found myself in St James’s Park, standing by the little lake there, idly watching five pure white waterbirds fighting with a duck over a crust of bread. The duck won. I took it for an omen, and went off to put on my black tie.At lunchtime, on the day of the Booker dinner, my husband said: “I don’t think you’re going to win, but, just in case, perhaps you’d better think of something to say.” Wise words, as it turned out. I wasn’t the favourite, so the advice I would give to anyone shortlisted would be the same: the Booker is nicely unpredictable, so it may turn out to be you, even if they are all saying that is unlikely. And remember, anyway, that there is no such thing as a best book, merely one on which a group of people have been able to reach agreement.Life after the Man Booker meant a couple of years and more when it was difficult to do what I wanted to do, which was get on with some writing. There was much book-related travel, too much time in airports, too many events. All that is 30 years ago now, and in a way I am quite grateful for the travel: it means that one of the satisfactions of old age is the thought that I shall never see Heathrow again. I have had all the travel I want or need.Once the searchlight is turned on others, your take on the Man Booker is that of any reader – the revelation of books you might not otherwise have come across, and will now read. That is the value of the shortlist (longlist, too) – a swathe of books are highlighted for readers. For me, though, there are also the ones that got away that should have won. Two, to my mind: Adam Thorpe’s Ulverton and Carol Shields’s The Stone Diaries.You take a young poet and novelist flaming with hunger and obscurity and dreams, you put him through the rigours of the short-story form, you unleash him on a novel he had been secretly writing for years, and you gift him with a strange magical night at the Guildhall in October 1991, and what do you get?You first get shock, surprise, retreat, delight, celebration, partying, making up for the hunger years, excessive travel, an explosion of readership, the opening up of the magic casement of African writing, a very English lingering backlash, many beautiful friendships, an initial stunned hiatus in writing followed by a steady, quiet harvest, opportunities for constant literary and spiritual growth, much conflicting criticism, an ebb and flow of fortunes, some smouldering resentment, the curious compliment of being plagiarised, publication in many languages, undue expectation followed by a rush to declare disappointment, many St Sebastian-like arrows patiently and humorously borne, love and kindness directed at me from ever renewing sources, and an abiding, never faltering gratitude for the fact that regardless of how my books are received or not received the flame and the hunger and the dreams are still there, enriched by that destiny-altering night at the Guildhall in 1991.For a participant, one thing the Man Booker prize is strange for is that your days of feverish writing can be two or more years behind you. There’s an extreme Doppler shift: you didn’t write the book with a view to later competing with others. You suddenly find yourself not only in competition but given odds at the bookies (I put a tenner on myself as if I were a horse – you just have to). As if runners ran a race against themselves, and judges were convened years later in a different place or you worked up the strength to lob a bowling ball up an alley over the horizon, and by the time you got over the rise you saw that agents and publishers had kept the thing rolling on. The night itself is numbing. The shortlist is the realistic prize. I don’t know how possible it is to find a single winner among artworks. From the perspective of the dinner table on the night you quickly realise the show’s set up for TV. I remember being told to expect one of five roving cameras in my face as the winner was announced. Those are the cameras that catch your reaction when someone else wins. Only five of them, as the winner will go to the stage. I spotted the cameras early. Watched them wait for the announcement and lived a very long split-second as I realised none were coming to me •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/722a5edd8736cfc61aa6e96549cc9a0d8f9d5e24/54_302_7189_4314/master/7189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bc8810b2059183f161689ee56f57169b","title":"oxford buses turn to uber style apps in on demand experiment","story":"Passengers can summon a minibus to and from any street corner in eastern half of cityMeet the new bus: not quite the same as the old bus. With echoes of the Latin American colectivo or Israeli sherut but in super-smart vehicles networked by Uber-style apps, on-demand services are popping up in cities around Britain – with the big transport companies unshackling their buses in the hope of driving cars off the roads.The biggest on-demand experiment yet launched this week in Oxford, where passengers can use an app to summon a minibus to and from any street corner in the eastern half of the city.At £2.50, the fare is a fraction of a taxi and only slightly more than the normal bus but the PickMeUp service is not limited by routes – although it will stop to pick up more passengers going the same way. With an almost identical scheme, ArrivaClick, launching in Liverpool later this summer, could on-demand bus services lure car owners onboard, cutting congestion and pollution?David Brown, the chief executive of the Go-Ahead transport group, which owns the PickMeUp operator, Oxford Bus Company, is cautiously optimistic. Speaking at Oxford’s science park, on the fringe of the city, he says: “This is classic territory where it’s tricky for a traditional bus service to deliver. But with the new technology you can identify where people are and provide for them in a way you couldn’t before.”Brown says: “If you don’t own a car, how do you get there? If it’s your first job you’re pretty stuffed. And if people can’t get to work and jobs that leads to another raft of social issues.”PickMeUp is looking to attract the well-heeled professional, too: the six low-emission Mercedes-Benz minibuses have free wifi, USB charging points and comfortable seating for 17, plus wheelchair space. There is no public subsidy but Go-Ahead has garnered support from employers in the business parks around Oxford’s periphery to encourage staff onboard, to reduce their own problems with car parking and congestion. Testing the service, the  was notified by the app on schedule, at St Aldates in the city centre, that its vehicle would be on the corner with Speedwell Street, 200 metres away, in two minutes. No other passengers were onboard but some people had already become regulars, according to the driver, Ryan Palmer. Having switched from driving double-deckers, he says. “I love it – it’s much more sociable. You get a hello on the normal buses but here you could really get to know the passengers.” Later, a bus arrived on cue at the science park, driven by Dawn, who enthuses: “I’ve been to places I never knew existed – and down some very narrow streets.”According to drivers and the firm, the service is proving popular with its 750 early adopters: for many, significantly quicker than other public transport and a lot cheaper than a taxi, with a similar level of convenience. Fares are planned to become dynamic – and potentially lower – when more people are on onboard but the current £2.50 fare will double for anyone seeking a bespoke ride along routes served by normal buses. “We don’t want to cannibalise our own service,” Brown says.The green shoots of on-demand buses come at a bleak time for many other services. Public subsidy has been squeezed, directly and indirectly, through years of government austerity: central grants to operators have been slashed, while financially stricken councils have stopped supporting routes deemed commercially unviable. Oxfordshire county council scrapped all bus subsidies in 2016, leading to the immediate disappearance of dozens of routes. Those villages are unlikely to ever provide enough demand for services such as PickMeUp to work, the company concedes. Phil Southall, the managing director of Oxford Bus Company, says: “It’s not going to solve rural bus problems overnight. But if people want to talk to us …”Data collated by requests to the app – built by the New York ride-sharing service, Via – can show where demand could potentially allow new, fixed routes to be created. Stagecoach, which gave a trial to a low-tech, landline version of on-demand buses along a linear route in Fife as far back as 2003, suggested that new technology could make them work in rural areas but would need public subsidy. It recently experimented with cab-to-bus tickets in Kent, an option First Group is developing with an app for “last-mile” shared taxi rides between homes and bus stops along a main route in Bristol. Other experiments, on linear routes, include CityMapper and Ford’s Chariot in London, and targeted, peak-hour ride-sharing schemes such as Slide in Bristol. Go-Ahead’s venture has the biggest scale and flexibility to date: almost 2,000 “virtual stops” in its app, operating from 6am to 11pm, to cover work shifts of employers such as TripAdvisor located in the science park. On-demand bus trials to date have not been unqualified successes: a scheme in Sydney, Australia, has been attacked as a scandalous waste of money after so far costing an average of A$100 (£56) per trip. However, Go-Ahead has pledged to run the service for at least a year to see if the firm’s £850,000 investment works. Brown says: “There is high travel demand and this links people for employment and social needs. If it doesn’t work here it won’t work anywhere. Then the car has won.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50b1b7ee7020766468d5615345adcb71ebffc2f1/0_103_3080_1848/master/3080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae06494023340fa8ed4e54a44a9f1d27","title":"go ahead given for merger of tata steel and thyssenkrupp","story":"Synergies expected as German and Indian firms combine their European operations German steel company Thyssenkrupp has agreed a merger of its European operations with Indian-owned Tata Steel.The deal signed on Friday will mean the European steel sector’s biggest shake-up since the takeover of Arcelor by Mittal in 2006.The new 50-50 joint venture – to be named Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel – will have about 48,000 workers and about €15bn (£13bn) in sales.Based in the Netherlands, it will be the continent’s second biggest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal and forms the core of Thyssenkrupp CEO Heinrich Hiesinger’s plan to turn the steel-to-submarines conglomerate into a technology company. “The joint venture with Tata Steel is an important milestone for the transformation of Thyssenkrupp to an industrials and service group and will lead to a significant improvement of the financial figures of Thyssenkrupp, effective with closing,” the group said in a statement. The definite agreement would be signed shortly, it added.The move followed a memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in September.The Tata Steel chairman, Natarajan Chandrasekaran, said: “The joint venture will create a strong pan-European steel company that is structurally robust and competitive. “This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company. We are confident that this company will create value for all stakeholders.” Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union, said steelworkers had fought hard to secure the future of British steel-making.“As part of this joint venture, we have secured significant investment across Tata Steel’s UK business, including a repair of Port Talbot’s blast furnace number five, which could see it produce steel until at least 2026,” he said. “With a commitment to avoid compulsory redundancies until October 2026, and the first £200m of any operating profit being invested back in the business, this joint venture has the potential to safeguards jobs and steel-making for a generation.”The Unite union’s national officer, Tony Brady, said: “Tata Steel’s UK workforce is world-class and has worked tirelessly under a cloud of uncertainty to keep steel-making alive in the UK. “Those steelworkers have made great sacrifices in working to secure a future for Tata Steel. We will be seeking guarantees over jobs and investment for the UK operations of the joint venture to secure the future of UK steel.”Dr Heinrich Hiesinger, the chief executive of Thyssenkrupp, said : “We will create a highly competitive European steel player based on a strong industrial logic and strategic rationale. “We will secure jobs and contribute to maintaining value chains in European core industries.”  Hiesinger had faced pressure from activist shareholders Cevian Capital and Elliott Advisors to extract more commitments from Tata Steel, whose European business performed worse than Thyssen’s since the deal was first announced in September, thus creating a valuation gap. Thyssenkrupp said that in case of an initial public offering of the joint venture, which is widely expected by investors and has been flagged by both companies, it would get a bigger share of the proceeds “reflecting an economic ratio of 55-45”. The German group also said it expected annual synergies of €400m-500m from the transaction, having previously communicated a maximum of €600m. Markus Grolms, the vice-chair of Thyssenkrupp’s supervisory board, said Tata Steel would continue to remain liable for environmental risks in Britain, where its Port Talbot factory, the least profitable of the joint venture, is based. He said Tata’s Dutch unit would be part of the joint venture’s cash-pooling mechanism, which had been a key demand for German workers concerned that Tata would give its own workers better conditions in the new company. “Yes, we do want to protect people. But we also want a company with better chances and less risks,” Grolms said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/454fd648524d97a12aa73d302cd96d410cf437bc/1_0_5200_3121/master/5200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=503ac523343049412712cbedcf6736be","title":"quiz how well do you know business jargon","story":"Want to get soaked in a thought shower?

The pretend landlord of the Queen Vic has figured this out“It’s getting tickly now,” Alex Ferguson famously observed during a title run-in. “Squeaky bum time, I call it.” This was in 2003, seven years after arguably the definitive Premier League bum-squeak. More of a follow-through, in fact, as the then Newcastle manager, Kevin\u0026nbspKeegan, succumbed to his now legendary Ferguson-induced rant. “I will love it if we beat them – love\u0026nbspit!” he frothed, of Manchester United. The rest, of\u0026nbspcourse, is history.To watch Theresa May come out of this week’s EU summit with just six weeks of negotiating time left on the Brexit clock, and declare the EU was risking the lives of its citizens by not striking a security deal with her, was to experience a similar look-away moment. The prime minister is this close to jabbing her finger at the camera and declaring the EU27 have got to go to Middlesbrough and get something. Of the many roles in which May has cruelly miscast herself, that of crap blackmailer is the most excruciating.Still, what happened at the business end of things – the by now traditional bit of an EU summit where May has to leave while the other countries talk about the important stuff? Pas devant les enfants, as my grandmother used to say. In summary, they seem to have\u0026nbspcome to a tentative arrangement on migration. And the EU’s Michel Barnier appears to be broadly in agreement with the Queen Vic’s Danny Dyer.Look, without wishing to involve you in what might sarcastically be described as “my process”, I no longer remark that things are “sentences I never expected to type”. We passed the Typed Lands in 2016. Wherever this place is, this is normal. Nor does my keyboard raise so much as a ??? to report that the prime minister’s official spokesman was today formally asked if the prime minister concurred with EastEnders actor Dyer that her predecessor, David Cameron, was “a twat”. This is where we live now. Try not to choke on it.If you haven’t seen Dyer’s outburst on ITV’s Good Evening Britain, I urge you to take 36 seconds to do so. As fellow studio guests including Pamela Anderson and Jeremy Corbyn cock their heads thoughtfully, Danny begins by observing that Brexit is a riddle. “So what’s happened to that twat David Cameron, who called it on?” he wonders. The inquiry turns out to be rhetorical, as the Real Football Factories legend expands: “He’s in Europe, in Nice with his trotters up, yeah? Where is the geezer?! I\u0026nbspthink he should be held account for it. He should be held account for it.”As the producers pan out to get reaction shots from\u0026nbspstudio guests such as Harry Redknapp and the Conservative party deputy chairman, James Cleverly – like I said, this is where we live now – Dyer can be heard lobbing in a final “Twat”. Speak for England, Danny! Or rather, speak for south-east metropolitan centres, Scotland and Northern Ireland! The rest think you’re the\u0026nbsptwat, but that’s showbiz.Wherever you stand on Brexit, though, we can at least\u0026nbspthank Dyer for his hilarious addition to Westminster’s annals of quotable quotes. God knows, they can always use the material. I was reminded this week that Neil Hamilton once won the Spectator’s Parliamentary Wit of the Year – an award that certainly puts Nigel Mansell winning Sports Personality\u0026nbspof the Year twice into perspective.Danny’s latest pensée is easily as amusing as his rumination on the 11th anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center. “Can’t believe it’s been nearly 11 years since them slags smashed into the twin towers,” this ran. “Still freaks my nut out to this day.”It is, however, not as amusing as the big-hitting Brexiters and four-star political commentators who have spent the hours since Dyer’s Brexit communique mobilising to condemn the reaction to it. Why are people listening to an actor, wonder various sorts who take themselves rather too seriously. I don’t know, guys – but let’s face it, they’ll probably have better luck down the bookies than if they listen to newspaper columnists.Why is his ghastly swearing being lionised, runs another line of inquiry. That I do know\u0026nbspthe answer to – it’s because it’s funny. And at this\u0026nbspstage in the Brexit U-bend, arguably the best we can hope for is a shit deal on\u0026nbspservices and a cheap giggle. Contrary to what half you lot told us, they can’t do us a bespokehaute-couturered-white-and-bluemoney-spraying Brexit. The pretend landlord of the Queen Victoria pub appears\u0026nbspto have figured this out, and is trying to salvage a point from the tie. Why haven’t you?Chiefly amusing, however, is the erstwhile Danny\u0026nbspDyer’s Deadliest Men presenter scooping David\u0026nbspCameron on his own memoirs. I don’t know what\u0026nbspthe former prime minister has been tossing off in his £25,000 shepherd’s hut over the past 23 months, but\u0026nbspI can already tell you it will lack the sparse precision of Dyer’s summary. In fact, if they want it to sell the book to people other than nerdy completists like me, then the publishers should consider running Danny’s precis as a cover quote. I’ve no idea what the book’s title will be – let’s hope it’s one of Cameron’s catchphrases, like It Was The Right Thing To Do – but I’d love to see the words “Twat … Danny Dyer” emblazoned above the\u0026nbsptitle, to bring in the punters.As for how Theresa May will characterise the coming summer of heatwaves and cabinet warfare in her own eventual memoirs, who can say? But with the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator privately warning there are just six weeks to go before both sides are required to sign a final deal, the situation must – in the words of the Chips Channon de nos jours – be freaking her absolute nut out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4eec4b34252269df7ca83d851f2bc114a1e4df84/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abe5065fe306f4a886fac2f6ad79a59","title":"jacinda ardern is the very hero the global left needs right now","story":"The future of the left is bright if it looks like Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-CortesAs social media birth announcements go, Jacinda Ardern’s handheld Facebook Live of herself and her newborn Neve Te Aroha Ardern Gayford is charming.New Zealand’s prime minister introduces her new baby with radiant sincerity. She thanks her midwife and the hospital staff for their generous professionalism, and New Zealanders for their kindness and gifts. With a quick cutaway, she even jokes with the baby’s father about his “dad jumper”.But as a political communication, the video is matchless. In an epoch overcast by growing shadows of reenergised rightwing authoritarianism, Ardern’s public hospital nativity offers a luminous symbolic affirmation of her leadership not just of New Zealand, but of the western electoral left.The leader of the first Labour government in New Zealand for a decade shares the explicit left agenda for investment in health, education and climate action, public housing, social justice. Ardern’s pledge to build “a kind and equitable nation where children thrive, and success is measured not only by the nation’s GDP but by better lives lived by its people” is the ancient standard of our side. Yet while recent celebrity left leaders have failed to win elections, or even nominations, Ardern gained the leadership of her party seven weeks out from an election, and she won. To understand why is to look beyond policy and into her representation of it. What distinguishes Ardern is her active embrace of what Walter Benjamin referred to as “the time of the now” and the erse and complex identities of a community that no longer sees itself as by, for and of propertied, straight white men. Doing so shatters a traditionalism that imprisons the left even as much as it inspires today’s right.Ardern is the first elected world leader to ever go on maternity leave. Of this, former NZ Labour prime minister Helen Clark noted: “These are the kinds of practical arrangements working women make the world over – the novelty here is that it is a prime minister who is making them. The signal this sends, however, is that this is life in the 21st century.” But the insight is enhanced by considering theorist Stuart Hall’s old observation that “Politics does not reflect majorities, it constructs them”. Local NZ commentator, Michelle Duff, lauded the events of Ardern’s maternity as a national achievement, writing, “Let’s just take a moment to appreciate that we, as a nation, have pushed the boundaries and created an environment where this can happen.” Clark said for New Zealand, this was merely “evolution”.Observe, also Ardern – who is Pakeha, not Maori – meeting the British queen wearing a Kahu huruhuru: a Māori feathered cloak “bestowed on chiefs and dignitaries to convey prestige, respect and power”. It was a demonstration of a status conferred, and not stolen, and a representation of a New Zealand unafraid to show pride in its indigenous past even as it engaged in diplomatic pleasantry with its colonial one. In this case, the spokeswoman was responding to Ardern’s choice of “Te Aroha” as her newborn’s middle name, which refers both to a mountain where Ardern grew up an a Maori language word for love. “Everybody knows what aroha means,” says Ardern in her baby video. Even though“everybody” doesn’t, every New Zealander certainly does. Ardern’s grasp of the local – from giving birth in a public hospital, to announcing her pregnancy on Instagram – is exemplary. The town of Te Aroha is planning a celebration of their namesake baby’s birth plans are to paint its buildings pink.The achievement here is Ardern’s marriage of the old left economic programme with the new explicitness of identity politics – and it resonates because it’s sincere. Failure to bridge these positions will doom all of us.Theorist Wendy Brown explained this in her 1999 essay of prophetic relevance to today’s particular political moment. Brown writes of a “left melancholy” as a state of wilful, purist political nostalgia, in which the left “has become more attached to its impossibility than to its potential fruitfulness, a Left that is most at home dwelling not in hopefulness but in its own marginality and failure, a Left that is thus caught in a structure of melancholic attachment to a certain strain of its own dead past.” It’s hard not to see this melancholy in the celebration of electoral defeats as somehow moral victories, when across the world the present, visible reality for women, indigenous people, the LGBTQIA+ community, refugees and so many others is that electoral outcomes represent life and death stakes. The alternative proposition is to remember “that the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power” – and they should pursue power, without shame. This statement was quoted by the victorious Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes, who delivered a shock upset to the established order when she won a Democratic primary in New York this week. In a party where the top three positions are held by septuagenarians, commentator Dana Milbank saw Ocasio-Cortes’s election not as a disruption to the Democratic trajectory but an event of happy augury. “The emerging electoral majority that already dominates the party and will soon dominate the country,” he observed “(is) progressive, young, female and nonwhite. It is no accident that Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old Latina, is all four.”If today’s left is going to stand a chance against an ascendant, muscular right, my hope is that she and other avowed socialists emerging within her electoral generation eschew the stale temptations of left melancholy for energising examples of a visionary left that looks as different to its past as a pregnant woman in a feathered cloak does to a room of suited men.“Strong men” of the right are now lining up governments from Italy to Turkey to the USA. The times of the now are ones in which we can construct majorities of a ersity they cannot – and do not wish to – represent. We can hope the influence of Jacinda Ardern and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes spread, or we can ensure that it does. The stakes for the marginalised remain life and death."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8273d9aac6f6de8716ff82765671eef241f8003b/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18684fe982e6fba617c385d852269547","title":"judge art reviews film critics movie","story":"Film critics aren’t above reproach. But just because a ‘40-year-old white dude’ pans a movie doesn’t mean it’s any goodSeventeen years since I started doing it for a living, I’ve finally been told which films I’m allowed to write about. Sliding Doors? Yes! If you’re a middle-class white woman who lives in London, that’s legitimate subject matter. Its heroine is a media type. I too take the tube – though a parallel universe doesn’t usually pop up if I miss the Piccadilly line. Happy-Go-Lucky? Just about: Sally Hawkins plays a teacher – uh-oh – but at least I’m also learning to drive. Bridget Jones? Not on your nelly. I don’t keep a diary. I don’t like chardonnay. I’ve never even slept with Hugh Grant.Now I know my limits, I shall stick strictly to movies which directly intersect with my own experience. So no more mafia masterpieces, or anything in a foreign language, or which involves war, aliens, gay people, a time before 1979, or cartoon jellyfish. The only thing I will see on screen is myself refracted back, for it is the veracity of this alone that I am in a position to judge.The people who belatedly told me this – mostly, as it happens, also white, middle-class women – were those who agreed with the stars of Ocean’s 8 that their film would have met with better reviews had the proportion of female critics been higher. They echoed the actor Brie Larson, who the previous day declared she didn’t care what a “40-year-old white dude” thought of Ava DuVernay’s little-loved fantasy A Wrinkle in Time as, by definition, he wouldn’t get it.Those are bad stats. Evidently there’s an obstacle somewhere along the line that means certain people tend not to enter a certain profession. But clamping down on the scope of that profession is a rum way to address it – as well as being patronising, illogical and dodgy. All feedback is void, runs the rationale, unless you’re either the target market for a film or vaguely resemble the people in it (there’s some confusion over which). It sanctions the silencing of people by dint of their age, ethnicity and gender. This is rarely a good look.So, Finnish pensioners must be muzzled as they exit Avengers: Infinity War, even if they enjoyed it. Should my son see The Little Mermaid, I’ll be sure to shut him up if he looks like he might try to discuss it. Women like films about women who are like them, and black people like films about black people. Hooray for the pigeonhole!And yet the apparently wildly racist members of the Academy awarded 12 Years a Slave and Moonlight their\u0026nbsptop prize. Reviewers raved about them too, somehow managing to see beyond their own skin, while\u0026nbspthe cinema-going public proved sadly less imaginative – for best picture Oscar-winners, neither film made a lot of money in the US. The best-reviewed movies there last year were Lady Bird, Get Out, Coco, The Big Sick, Dunkirk and Wonder Woman – a selection almost impeccably unrepresentative of the people writing the reviews.The debate about the intersectionality of film critics has become a hectoring convention of people having their cake and eating it. The muddle is troubling. How does an inclusivity mission sit with telling someone without ovaries to keep mum about Mamma Mia!? The most famous film critic of all time – the New Yorker’s Pauline Kael – rarely gets a namecheck. Two of the most respected reviewers in the US at the moment happen to be the LA Times’s Justin Chang (35, Korean American) and the New York Times’s Manohla Dargis (57, female).How do you square the insistence that there are exciting and important women’s stories overdue for the telling with remaking Ghostbusters? You can’t just blame the studios. Their primary job is to make money, and if that means jumping on bandwagons and yoking themselves to brand awareness, so be it. The fact remains that punters showed up: despite the backlash and poor reviews, Ghostbusters took $230m worldwide. Meanwhile, they conspicuously failed to turn out for other 2016 releases that could perhaps lay greater claim to being essential female narratives (as well as better movies): films such as Queen of Katwe ($10m) and Toni Erdmann ($12m), 20th Century Women ($7m) and Things to Come ($6m), Maggie’s Plan ($5m) and American Honey ($2m), Certain Women ($2m) and The Fits ($170,000). Yet as female-fronted spin-offs go, Ghostbusters still felt more organic than Ocean’s 8 ($177m so far), whose psychological weirdness can only really be explained by the fact that, for better or worse, it is unusual for eight women to club together and commit grand larceny.Perhaps there is something else going on here too: a diminishment in the value we place on whether something is actually any good, rather than on whether we just hope it’s good, as that would be handy. The basic quality of something, be it a movie or a review of it, has become, if not quite redundant, then certainly something skirted around.Considerations of script, performance, direction, taste, plausibility and originality must be managed against those of intention, politics and climate. Asking if certain films are actually any cop can seem in itself impudent, perhaps renewing an offence tackled in the film. The standing ovation that erupted at the premiere of Nate Parker’s The Birth of a Nation at the height of #OscarsSoWhite fever in 2016 demonstrates how appetite can trump sense. The film was terrible, but people only clocked that a few months later, when Parker’s involvement in a sexual assault case came to light. Had it not, this ghastly turkey would probably have been for ever lauded.When it comes to culture, objectivity has become an increasingly dirty concept. And the imputation is therefore that the endeavours of anyone who has dedicated their professional life to judging things have been at best fruitless, at worst fraudulent. Yet anyone who has seen a film, eaten a sandwich, sat on a chair, or\u0026nbspengaged with anything for which a quality benchmark exists, must know that sacrificing standards does no one any favours. Not the person who’s given up time and money to see the movie, the film-makers making genuinely good movies, the journalists trying to write good reviews, or the readers trying to make head or tail of them.One thing I like about cinema is that it gives me a break from my own parochialism: my stupid face, my petty concerns. I’d thought one of the points of art was to offer fresh perspectives. Happy-Go-Lucky is a fine film. I’d happily give it a repeat viewing. But if I knew I would be forced to watch it and variations on it for all eternity, I\u0026nbspthink I’d have opted for a different job.• Catherine Shoard is the ’s film editor"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c39f36eb50de2d034a51c2bef5142bf530f41681/0_0_7138_4284/master/7138.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9126e372c34200bd3b74d8e6a8ced6a","title":"unbelievable uk homes rent airbnb","story":"Eco pods, beach retreats and treehouses – just a few of the many unique properties for a home from home on your next UK break"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e39c5324c314a3dc9d1d4959442fb63679e7411/0_0_5189_3116/master/5189.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ff55132329c82f3456d5057915ef3064 960w","title":"beauty best facial self tans sali hughes","story":"Forget heavy foundation: this is what your face needs for summerFacial self-tans are a great way to pare down a\u0026nbspmakeup routine for summer, when heavy foundation looks excessive and feels foul.

OK, maybe not everybody, and maybe you didn’t. Plenty, though, did. Just try typing Portugal, Uruguay and “shithousery” into Google.On Friday though, Uruguay’s manager, Óscar Tabárez preferred to recall a different story and a whole different set of values, going back to the 1954 World Cup to tell a parable and question the “myths”, as he put it. Alongside, Luis Suárez sat captivated, silently gazing at him.“There is not so much history between us so far, so history will be marked by tomorrow’s game,” Suárez had said. What awaits in Sochi is spectacular. European champions in 2016 v South American champions in 2011 three of the world’s great strikers, men who scored 344 league goals over the last four years the winner of four of the last five Ballon d’Ors, and probably a fifth this year too, voted the planet’s best player again – “not just a great player, their leader,” as Tabárez said and the defender Diego Maradona calls a “superstar”. Then there is the other stuff this clash brings – and clash is the word. That, at least, is the assumption.The Madrid derby and the clásico recreated. Pepe v Suárez, Godín v Ronaldo. There is plenty of previous. There’s Ronaldo and Godín battling in the area, Ronaldo punching Godín in the back of the head. There’s Suárez catching Pepe with a hand across the face one time and a boot across the shin another, the defender rolling round the turf with hand in the air, calling for the priest to deliver his last rites after both of them.And then there is that Camp Nou meeting where Suárez pushes the centre-back, who bumps into the back of him, treading on his foot. Suárez turns and shouts something about his “mother’s shell”, which probably doesn’t really require a proper translation, to which the defender responds: “You pushed me first.” At which point Suárez swears at him again and warns him that he’s “saving one” for him.But here’s the thing: the defender he clashed with on that occasion was not an opponent on Saturday, it was a teammate, José María Giménez. Just as the defender he gave a black eye was not Pepe, it was Godín.All of which says something about the competitiveness that has helped make Uruguay football’s great overachievers it certainly says something about Suárez – a superb footballer who plays as if he was no good at all, who talks about a nation who may not have the talent that others do but who will not be beaten for courage, fight, that garra charua of legend. As Godín puts it: “Luis has got where he is because of the way he is: you see he gets angry, wound up, he fights, he protests.”He might not for much longer. There was a moment here on the eve of meeting Portugal when the Uruguay striker was asked about the impact of VAR: yellow cards are down, red cards are down and penalties are up. “The players talk about it,” Suárez said. “Players are protesting less.” And with that he grinned and raised his hand: players like me. He also said that, having worked with a fitness coach before the tournament, he felt better now than in the opening game, adding with a smile: “Which isn’t hard.”Still, the anticipation is that this will be tough indeed, a confrontation between some of the best, most competitive, most uncompromising strikers and defenders there are. Yet that version of events was challenged here there was something deeper. Uruguay have collected only one yellow card at this tournament while their central defenders are tough there is a nobility about them and, when it came to their final group game, they were in a similar situation to England but there was no doubt: they defeated Russia. “We don’t play with the results: our objective is to win every game, that’s our mentality,” Suárez said. It has also, Tabárez suggested, too often been their obligation, a “heavy load to carry in your backpack” – one that conditioned their characteristics.It was then that Tabárez talked about myth and reality then too that he told the story of the 1954 World Cup. He had mentioned that this team has been together with him for 12 years. And, asked about the continuity within the team, the thread that runs through it as seen through the central defenders and leaders, from Diego Lugano to Diego Godín and Diego Godín to José María Giménez, he traced a line further back. As he told the tale – slowly, quietly, at length, so out of keeping with his surroundings yet so like him – it took you. They call him Maestro for a reason.“Fifa talk about fair play but that was there before. People talk about Maracanã, the “best in the world”, and that’s a weight. The idea that being second is no good. All those things that are said as if Uruguay was a country of 50m, like Colombia or Argentina, and that’s not the way it is,” he said. “That can create a feeling of impotence and the first reaction to that is the culture on the pitch. We always wanted to see beyond that.”“When Uruguay lost in 1954, when they lost their status as an unbeaten team, they were defeated 4-2 in extra time by Hungary. An Italian journalist wrote an article afterwards quoting the Hungary player who said: ‘I had to mark the best player in the world. Schiaffino was clearly better than me but because of those things that happen in football, we won the game.’ And the Uruguay captain said: ‘We have been beaten by the best team in the world.’ We have to recover that. These players have shown that they have that, and those values have been transmitted to the next generation.”Win or lose. “We have prepared well,” Tabárez said. “But football teams are made of glass. It can break. A player can’t sleep because the baby cried. Another is fighting with his girlfriend. It breaks. The World Cup is always special but we don’t know what will happen until the game starts.”There was a suggestion that the answer to that question might be: not very much. That this game would be boring, bar the battle. “I don’t know,” Tabárez said, “but, if it’s boring and we win, we’ll celebrate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb9c5f33aa57861359ed66d7a885438fd1d0556e/0_0_3757_2254/master/3757.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79cbebf7a7c21c69df7c38f6b35e5fa6","title":"colombia scouting report england last 16 juan quintero james rodriguez world cup","story":"Juan Quintero’s set pieces and Yerry Mina’s aerial strength are threats but above all the team need James Rodríguez to be fitVulnerable to an aggressive pressThe biggest take-away for England’s scouts from Colombia’s 1-0 win over Senegal in the final group game would have come from the first half. Playing in a 4-4-2 formation, Senegal pressed high and Colombia were forced on to the back foot knocked from their rhythm. They like to play out from the back but when their defenders are harassed, the team can appear likewise. Colombia did not touch the ball in the Senegal penalty box during the opening half. The difference to their second group match against Poland was marked. In that game, the Poles sat off them and Colombia expressed themselves. Give this team enough rope and they will tie you in knots.An error in the central defendersWhen Davinson Sánchez stretched into a 17th-minute tackle on the Senegal forward, Sadio Mané, Colombia were plunged into trauma. The referee, Milorad Mazic, awarded a penalty and it went to VAR. Cue a tense wait before, to Colombian relief, Mazic overturned his decision. Sánchez could be feted for a well-timed challenge. On the other hand, it is not always good to see a centre-half having to e into a last-ditch slide tackle. Mané had found the space off Sánchez’s shoulder and the 22-year-old’s critics will say it was fresh evidence of him switching off. Sánchez’s concentration levels remain suspect. In the Japan game, it was his error when dealing with a routine ball over the top that led to the chance that caused his teammate, Carlos Sánchez, to be shown a red card. The other centre-half, Yerry Mina, brings physical presence but not pace over the first five yards. He takes a while to lengthen his stride and get up to speed. Mina was beaten with alarming ease by Mané and England will relish the opportunity to run at him.Colombia rely on their star player James Rodríguez in creative terms but what happens if they have to make do without him? The scar on the Senegal win was the loss of the attacking midfielder to injury after 31 minutes and the alarm was plain in José Pekerman’s post-match address. “I am extremely concerned,” the manager said. “It is a topic that could overshadow everything.” Rodríguez had carried a calf problem into the tournament – it restricted him to a substitute’s cameo against Japan – and he felt fatigue towards the end of the Poland game. “We didn’t think it could be an injury,” Pekerman said. But the poster boy of Colombia’s run to the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals was in obvious discomfort well before he went down and could not continue. Rodríguez has played off the left here, with licence to drift inside, but without him against Senegal, the team could not control the ball and get passes to Juan Cuadrado and the striker Radamel Falcao. Colombia are a different prospect without him.Juan Quintero hauled Colombia back into the Japan tie with a cleverly executed free-kick. Having predicted that the defensive wall would jump, he drilled his shot underneath it to catch out the goalkeeper, Eiji Kawashima. But it has been the consistent quality of Quintero’s indirect set pieces that have been such a positive feature of Colombia’s campaign so far. The ping and curl he gets on the ball is a testament to his technique. It was from his corner that Mina headed the winner against Senegal and England will need to be alert to the defender’s towering aerial threat. Mina also scored with a header against Poland, having stayed up after a set piece. “What happened with the corner against Senegal was not a coincidence,” Pekerman said. “We worked it very well. We had the right moves to throw Senegal off balance.”At the end of the first half against Senegal, the Colombia players gathered in the middle of the pitch for a discussion before heading back to the dressing room together. There was plenty to talk about as they had been outplayed. But they emerged with renewed purpose, established a foothold and found a way to win. Against Japan, following the disaster of Carlos Sánchez’s third-minute dismissal, they had also rallied to get back into it although, on that occasion, the game would end in defeat. There is a steel about Pekerman’s team and there is little doubt that their excellent showing at the last World Cup has helped to harden their mentality.Cuadrado can blow extremely hotThe winger – known to English fans due to his disappointing spell at Chelsea – can frustrate and there is the feeling that he is a confidence player, sometimes stifled when things do not go his way. But when his tail is up, he can wreak havoc – as he demonstrated against Poland. With Quintero’s unerring distribution from the No 10 position, Colombia like to effect quick transitions and isolate Cuadrado against the left-back. His duel with Ashley Young promises to be pivotal. It should be noted that most of Colombia’s pace comes from wide areas, with Quintero a strolling presence and Carlos Sánchez not noted for his ability to break at pace. Mateus Uribe, the other deeper-lying midfielder, is a box-to-box player."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d886782a9fc76e9517308602d518c490d3a7ed41/0_27_7168_4302/master/7168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f6bec051d043a87568b202a54931a50","title":"watch the world cup last 10 minutes christian sinibaldi","story":"Photographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonPhotographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonWhen Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.”Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.”It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut.Rick Cooper, 41, and wife Jo, 41, sons Leo, eight, and Aaron, four, Malc, 44, Alison, 72Milnrow, RochdaleTiming is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags.The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England.Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.”His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.”Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.”Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 JuneCristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.”Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children.“My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.”After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.”The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.”Adama Karde and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 JuneThe music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Karde’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums.Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.”An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates.“I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.”For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.”Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.”Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”.Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right).The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.”“I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.”Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly.Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.”His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages.For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.”The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium.Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 JuneIf only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0.It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”.Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.”“I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.”Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.”Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.”On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion.Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.”The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 JuneIceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.”But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.”What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.”Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.”Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in.But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.”Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 JuneIn Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa).The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations.Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009.“Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.”The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!”Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.”“The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.”Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 JuneStudies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.”Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.”Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.”There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.”At the apex of a isive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win.“It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.”The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.”After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.”Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.”Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.”Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 JuneNo one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.”Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck.“I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.”Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’”He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.”Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 JuneThe balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.”Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg.Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.”“Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.”Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.”• Commenting on this piece?

Neymar has pranced and preened, particularly in the first two games, and they were slow to get going but there was an ominous feel to their win over Serbia and they look capable of raising things further. Philippe Coutinho has been a considerably bigger influence than their Ligue 1-based star turn so far if Mexico are disposed of then a mouthwatering quarter-final with Belgium is likely.Given that manner in which they sailed through the most difficult group, Croatia are arguably the team of the tournament so far. They have rarely been spectacular but look composed, organised and unflustered, with their biggest stars stepping up in the thumping win over Argentina. A meeting with Spain in the last eight looks likely and Zlatko Dalic’s side cannot be ruled out of doing something special.Whether or not they really wanted to, Belgium’s second string glided past England and of the pre-tournament favourites they have arguably had the best time of things in the group stage. Romelu Lukaku and Eden Hazard got their eyes in during the cakewalks against Panama and Tunisia Japan should be obliging opponents in the round of 16 and this generation of players may never have a better chance to prove half a decade of hype correct.So far, so straightforward for Uruguay, who would have expected little else from a weak Group A. They have not exactly sparkled although there were suggestions against Russia that they are gathering a head of steam and it will have done Edinson Cavani no harm to join Luis Suárez on the scoresheet. Now Oscar Tábarez needs to get more out of a midfield that is yet to gel satisfactorily.The second-half evisceration of Poland was one of the tournament’s most exciting displays so far and there is no doubt that, at full throttle, Colombia can take anybody apart. Senegal showed that they can run into trouble when denied space, though, and there are doubts about their defence’s capability to cope with speed. Much may depend on James Rodríguez’s injury, which left José Pékerman visibly concerned on Thursday.That whirlwind of a showing against Germany now looks a little harder to judge in the light of subsequent events. Mexico are capable of playing sublime football at a lightning tempo and boast an enviable array of technicians Sweden found it all too easy to batter them into submission though and Brazil are very unlikely to give them carte blanche to operate as they would prefer. They are just about keeping it together but Spain are yet to find a blend that looks capable of going all the way. How much influence Fernando Hierro can actually wield on a team he inherited at the last moment is questionable attacking balance has largely been lacking, save for a scintillating half-hour spell against Portugal, while they have been rattled by lesser opponents with surprising ease. There is always the suspicion they will come good but Spain look rudderless.It can sometimes feel hard to forgive France’s lack of fluency given the thrilling riches at their disposal and that was a feeling heightened after the Anschluss-esque tie with Denmark. But they came through a relatively testing group unbeaten and, if nothing else, Kylian Mbappé has made an excellent start to his first World Cup. Can Didier Deschamps finally cajole something extra against another disjointed giant in the form of Argentina?By now everybody should know better than to underestimate Sweden, who were on nobody’s radar at the outset but outlasted everyone to top Group F. Their 3-0 win over Mexico was, even allowing for a no-show from their opponents, one of the best tactical displays of the tournament so far they used their power and aggression to superb effect but have a dash of quality too and will feel quietly confident now.Is it coming home? From a Russian vantage point a couple of wins against meagre opponents seem to have sparked inordinate optimism back home although we have to be fair: this is a pleasant, likeable England team with a manager who is more tuned in to the various demands of wearing the shirt than any in memory. They will, it seems, have to do things the hard way now but perhaps it does no harm for Gareth Southgate’s side to be genuine unknown-quantity material.Those “Eagle” celebrations contrived by Granit Xhaka and Xherdan Shaqiri may have dominated the headlines but this is the slickest, most impressive Switzerland side in recent memory and the draw has opened up nicely for them. They will need to regain some of the momentum they lost in cruising to a draw with Costa Rica, but the intensity they mustered against Serbia and in drawing with Brazil suggested they could come through from nowhere.This is probably the worst Argentina team of the past two decades and that is more the pity given that, if they had the talent in midfield and defence to match their attacking riches, their possibilities would be limitless. They are mightily fortunate to have got this far but they do have Lionel Messi and, as he confirmed with that luscious finish against Nigeria, that is enough to keep people watching and believing. Little has happened to dissuade anyone from the time-honoured notion that Portugal are overly reliant on Ronaldo although, judging by his performance in the first two games, that does not necessarily have to matter. They were outplayed by Morocco, though, and came within inches of an astonishing exit against Iran surely one of Uruguay, France, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil will have too much to block the European champions from reaching the business end.Their highlights reel from the last fortnight is hardly extensive but Denmark have been expertly drilled by Åge Hareide and, while Peru won the popular vote in Group C, are in the last 16 on merit. Two flourishes from Christian Eriksen – a fine assist against the Peruvians and a super goal in the draw with Australia – were a reminder that they have a world-class talent in their midst and Croatia will not fancy facing them.Excitement around the host nation’s chances peaked after resounding wins over Saudi Arabia and Egypt but was quickly dampened by Uruguay. Russia are clearly a better side than many people had supposed but it would take some audacity to predict they have anything to trouble Spain. They have probably hit their ceiling but several careers have been enhanced and their relative success has added a welcome extra dimension to the tournament, too.Good, lucky or a little bit of both? Japan looked the weakest of Group H’s contenders at the outset but here they are and fortune has favoured them ever since Carlos Sánchez’s early dismissal in their opener with Colombia. Their own manager disgusted himself by shutting up shop towards the end of then defeat to Poland they squeaked through but it is hard to see what this team has in its armoury to take it further.Mehdi Taremi may never forget the injury-time miss that, moments after Iran had been given a VAR-aided lifeline against Portugal, would have improbably won them both the match and Group G. He had also fluffed an opportunity to equalise against Spain Iran looked extremely useful in most departments and would have been a fascinating prospect in the round of 16.Aliou Cissé’s team could hardly have been unluckier not to get through the group stage and will, in the end, reflect on a lack of discipline late on against Japan. They were punished by a soft Keisuke Honda equaliser and, just as tellingly, the two late yellow cards that ultimately tipped Group H against them. It was a shame, as they are a rounded and entertaining side that deserved better.Partly through the free-flowing nature of their football and partly through the remarkable support they received from their travelling fans, Peru felt like the greatest loss to the tournament at this juncture. It would probably have all been different if Christian Cueva had scored a spot kick against Denmark in the first game in the end wastefulness scuppered them and by the time they discovered a clinical edge against Australia it was too late.A curate’s egg of a group stage from Nigeria, who came away feeling aggrieved to have lost against Argentina but might not have had anything to mourn if they had turned up for their opening tie with Croatia. They played some scintillating counterattacking football in spells, notably during the second half of the win over Iceland, but it was not enough and Gernot Rohr will hope this was valuable experience for what he says is his real target: Qatar 2022.Hervé Renard’s team played with a verve and invention that caused many to swoon but, similarly to Peru, fell short where it mattered. The manner of their defeat to Iran was devastating and they deserved far more against Portugal, too. That made the draw with Spain even more of a frustration they should have been in a position where it counted for more.Before the match with Germany it seemed fair to assume South Korea’s tournament would fizzle out without a single moment to commit to memory. They proved everyone wrong and could have scored more than twice in an exciting counterattacking display the shame was that they could not quite get it together in close contests with Sweden and Mexico.Serbia’s campaign brought a familiar mix of brilliance and frustration, garnished with the kind of political controversy that tends to overshadow so much of their football. In fairness it was hardly their players’ fault that Xhaka and Shaqiri caused such a storm they could have done more, though, to see out a draw instead of throwing it away at the death. After that the die was cast.This was a bridge too far for Iceland in the end although they were hardly outclassed in Group D and took the fight to added time in the final game. The early draw with Argentina was their high point what really undid them was a sloppy second half against Nigeria and now, with Heimir Hallgrímsson taking time to consider his future, the job to replicate their recent success may not be easy.Where to begin? By the latter stages of the defeat to South Korea – and in fact well before everything completely unravelled – Germany’s performance bore more than a passing resemblance to the fare offered up by England against Iceland at Euro 2016. There were attacks and shots on goal but no obvious structure, plan or, uncharacteristically, confidence. What an ignominious way to relinquish their grip on the trophy.They salvaged some pride against a Japan side that was totally unfussed by the end, but Poland were supposed to be much better than this. Instead they were deservedly beaten by Senegal and dismantled comprehensively by Colombia Robert Lewandowski was invisible, not aided by an inadequate supporting cast, and a world-class striker’s chance to make an impact on this stage while near his peak has passed.If they had held out for a tiny bit longer against England then, as it happened, Nabil Maaloul’s team would have added some genuine interest to the denouement of Group G. It ended up being a sterile final day although they did at least pick up a win against Panama their cause had already been lost through a porous display in the defeat to Belgium.In some ways this World Cup arrived at exactly the wrong time for Australia, who were caught between permanent managers and needed a near-miracle from Bert van Marwijk if anything was to come of their campaign. They played well against both France and Denmark but, when everything came down to a meeting with already-eliminated Peru, ended up falling well short. Quality was particularly lacking in a shot-shy attack.When they cut loose against Switzerland, Costa Rica looked a genuinely exciting attacking proposition. But it was too late by then, even if their defence had done a similarly eye-catching job in frustrating Brazil for 91 of the 98 minutes, and recriminations will focus on a tight opening defeat to Serbia. Oscar Ramírez’s cautious tactics drew criticism and, after watching them on Wednesday, you could see why.Such a shocking opening-night show against Russia suggested Saudi Arabia were firmly on course for three hidings. As it happened they then played well against Uruguay and dramatically overcame a broken Egypt to give their summer a more positive hue that capitulation against a moderate host team will be the abiding memory, though.After losing comfortably to Belgium and receiving a walloping from England it was tempting to wonder whether Panama might be the worst World Cup finals contender of the modern era. Their reaction to Felipe Baloy’s consolation goal against the latter showed how much it meant simply to be here, though, and a creditable performance against Tunisia ensured Hernán Dario Gómez’s team returned home with pride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfa22af7ba6cf135320d785d578a3c155504878b/14_40_2533_1520/master/2533.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a4251e89b7dc3988f3a34b566c45d5a","title":"world cup group stage knockout rounds","story":"A brilliantly entertaining group stage produced 116 goals and a plethora of stories – this already feels like a tournament with is own distinctive characterAnd breathe. After 48 matches, 116 goals and a thrillingly varied swag-bag of drama, big-name angst and rolling VAR-palaver, Russia 2018 has now reached its midpoint.These things invariably alter from week to week, the tone and texture of a tournament defined by a few key games. But as the World Cup takes a breath, hitches its shorts up and contemplates a final punt through the laces at the knockout stage, it already feels like a tournament with its own distinctive character.Yes, it’s that time already. Welcome to That Was The Russia 2018 Group Stage that was.Whatever your view on the ultimate quality of the football, it has been a brilliantly entertaining World Cup so far, with few of the mind-numbingly dull games that have occasionally dogged the group stage.From the high-ceilinged quality of Portugal and Spain battering away at each other like a pair of hall-of-fame Mexican middleweights to the novel spectacle of simulcast video referee shenanigans to the emphasis so far on team play over star power: Russia 2018 has found its own shapes, mushroomed into some unexpected areas and confirmed some well-honed truths.Some of the big notes were nailed at the start. The host nation has played well and remains fully engaged. The opening game at the Luzhniki Stadium was a brilliantly staged piece of theatre, complete with an enjoyably opaque address from Vladimir Putin, iconic alpha-dog shots of Gianni Infantino lurking like an overattentive blini-waiter between Putin and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and a 5-0 defeat of a wretched Saudi Arabia.The grounds have all been ready and fit for purpose. Russia’s volunteers have been friendly and accommodating. And around the edges the social spirit of the country has come to the fore. Rather than battering visiting fans about the head with knuckledusters, the Russian people have been excellent hosts on the whole, often to a fault. There are plenty of tales of unsolicited rescues from the wrong side of town, drinks bought in bars and lost property returned.Undoubtedly Russia has prepared a face to meet the faces, its cities carefully scrubbed and posed, as is usually the case. But the top line, entirely unsurprisingly, is that this is just another country like all the other countries, built to a larger scale but with the usual variety of all human life. The basic spectacle of Senegalese, Moroccans, Peruvians and South Koreans twirling their flags around Red Square felt like an arresting transformative moment in itself.On the pitch the football has been relentlessly moreish, to the extent a rest day now feels like a hardship to be grudgingly endured. Some stats thrown out by the Fifa machine: Russia 2018 has seen an average of 2.54 goals per game in the group stage, slightly down on Brazil 2014 but up on every other World Cup of the last 30 years except for France 98 and USA 94.Belgium are top scorers with nine. Uruguay have yet to concede at all. Forty-seven goals have come in the first half, and 75 in the second. One could go on. Javier Mascherano, whose World Cup has once again resembled the harrowing final scenes of a notably gore-stained 1980s Vietnam war movie, has committed the most fouls.Neymar has been fouled an astonishing 17 times, though this depends on one’s specific definition of the words “being fouled”. Lionel Messi and Victor Moses are among five players tied on most handballs so far (two), another strand to the never-ending Moses v Messi debate.The fastest player so far, with a top speed of 34kph, is Cristiano Ronaldo, who is, lest we forget, 33 years old and in his 16th season as a pro. Finally, and another tribute perhaps to the reach of VAR, only one player has been booked for ing. Surprisingly this is dear old Son Heung-min, who might just feel a little wronged on that score.When it comes to the best teams so far Croatia are the obvious choice. The 3-0 defeat of Argentina is the outstanding result along with Mexico’s surgical dismantling of Germany. Luka Modric is arguably the outstanding player of the tournament to date. Belgium have looked like the genuine contenders their depth of talent suggests. The arm-wrestle between Portugal and Uruguay on Saturday will see a meeting of two teams with the necessary tournament bastardy, plus elite attackers in form.Otherwise everyone is below the radar, still looking to come to the boil. France have looked stodgy for all their dazzling talent. Brazil still seem to be finding a workable groove. Germany had more shots than anyone else but finished bottom of their group, victims of the dedication to method and systems that served them so well but brought a strange kind of entropy at this tournament. Spain have looked slow and underpowered at times but showed moments of exhilaratingly pure champion quality in the exchanges between Isco and Andrés Iniesta.Beyond this there has been a refreshing refusal to bow to the star players of club football. Ronaldo has been productive as ever but a semi-fit Neymar has had 17 shots at goal, scoring only once, and made 24 failed dribbles. Messi has produced just the one otherworldly moment. This is a different game from the relentless numbers of club football, each team stacked with a greater variety of human talent. The knockout phase, with its fine point details, may provide a more hospitable centre stage.There have been obvious tactical changes, alterations to the game’s rhythm driven by technology. Aided by the video referee, and by a lack of defensive prep from some teams, set pieces have played a large part. There have been 24 penalties awarded, 18 scored and six missed, leading to fears the game is undergoing a fundamental alteration in its gravity.Some have suggested teams will now focus tactics on winning penalties, will employ specialist penalty-takers, that a kind of apocalyptic penalty fixation is the future. More likely teams will simply adapt how they defend as has already begun to happen during the tournament. Overall the lessons of VAR from Russia 2018 are that when handled brusquely, when consigned to simple howlers and obvious mistakes, a little VAR can be a good thing.Otherwise some things remain the same. The dance between possession football and counterattack continues. Predictably Spain embody one side of this, completing 400 more passes than anyone else so far. England are sixth on that list, a significant moment in itself. As the tournament winds down, as players tire and stakes grow ever higher, it seems likely the teams that pass and keep the ball best will prosper.One irritation: there has been a surprising amount of play-acting, players writhing in apparent agony holding the wrong body part or shrieking when briefly touched. No doubt this is a misguided side effect of a greater refereeing presence. Countermeasures are required to stamp it out, as they are to restrain a related rise in the haranguing of officials.A final bonus point: a total of 2,178,894 ticket holders have watched with an average attendance of 45,394. The grounds have been boisterously full, with lulls in the partisan noise often filled by sudden outbreaks of “Ross-iy-ya” from the locals.This has felt like a genuinely epic-scale World Cup, football in a big country, with a vast bloom of interest and history in every city. The weather will now change, with a more staccato feel to the more micro-managed drama of knockout football. Over to you, part two. It won’t be an easy act to follow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17c9c9b7f2541ca61feb7ce32a64bf7fcf037746/0_270_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2167241bad037f6721e49bbc4ec9a70","title":"world cup 2018 last 16 buildup russia france argentina uruguay portugal live","story":"Thinking about a last-minute jaunt to Russia?France against Argentina and then Portugal pitting their wits against Uruguay, plus so many inidual duels. What are we looking forward to most? Mbappé v Messi or Suárez v Ronaldo? What do we reckon? “A different competition is starting now because there’s no margin for error,” says Uruguay’s Matías Vecino, teeing everything up just beautifully. Less than five hours until kick-off ...England have form for being hurt by Premier League alumni. Among the 21 players out training today is Gary Cahill, formerly team-mates with Falcao, the Colombia striker intent on sending Gareth Southgate’s side packing in the last 16 on Tuesday. Falcao’s face didn’t fit at Chelsea but now he’s firing: He never really got up and running, or got a good spell of games back to back to find any sort of form. Obviously the competition was there and I’m sure for him it was difficult but he showed his character to go on and find his goalscoring form again. He’s been banging goals in again ever since.Gary Neville, the former England defender and coach, has questioned the change of “tone” surrounding the team since that slender defeat in Kaliningrad. “It’s the best opportunity we’ve had for 28 years to progress far in a World Cup,” Neville says. “We should enjoy it. Gareth will have known the risks of leaving players out, he will know what people will say if we lose against Colombia on Tuesday. He believes in the plan, he believes that England can go far in this competition.”England are gearing up for that Colombia test on Tuesday night in Moscow, but what can Gareth Southgate’s squad expect from a team regarded as dark horses in some quarters and derided as poor in others, namely by Paul Merson. We know all about Falcao (don’t we?) and James Rodríguez, who will undergo a MRI scan to determine whether he can play any part in the game, but what about their other strengths and weaknesses? David Hytner has more:And, with Davinson Sánchez set to duel with Harry Kane away from Tottenham’s Enfield training base, their WhatsApp group has gone into overdrive, with Kieran Trippier and Dele Alli likely to feature:Argentina have been thoroughly disappointing so far, reaching this stage of the competition – the last 16 – by the skin of their teeth. Arguably their standout player, Éver Banega, has seized the chance to impress, though, having been omitted from the final 23-man squad for the World Cup in Brazil four years ago:England are out training on a cold and drizzling day in Zelenogorsk, but Fabian Delph and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are both absent, the former having been given permission to fly home with his wife, Natalie, due to give birth today. Loftus-Cheek, meanwhile, is doing some gym work alone at the team hotel in Repino as part of his recovery from Thursday’s defeat to Belgium. Brazil’s Neymar, as you’ve never seen him before:Transfer nugget: a little underwhelming maybe, but Leeds United have signed Chelsea’s England Under-21 midfielder Lewis Baker on a season-long loan deal, with the goalkeeper Jamal Blackman likely to join him on a similar basis. Another deal set to go through imminently is David Brooks’s £11m move to Bournemouth from Sheffield United. Keep up-to-date with all the moves here:The perfect way to limber up for a feast of football later today:From the England camp, where the honeymoon’s over and suddenly not everything is a bed of roses, but fortunately, Gareth Southgate already knows as much. “I wasn’t so comfortable with the love-in in the buildup to Belgium, to be honest, so it’s nice that there’s a little bit of an edge back,” Southgate said. Croatia have snuck into second, England’s next opponents Colombia are in fifth and Germany plummet to 25th. At the halfway stage, all 32 teams have been critiqued and rated:It is 16 years to the day that Ronaldo – and his infamous hair island – got the better of Germany to win the 2002 World Cup in Yokohama:A date with Argentina in Kazan gives France the perfect opportunity to turn on the style, given their wealth of, particularly attacking talent. Or will this be another one of those days, a stodgy performance, bogged down by iniduals ultimately trying too hard or not hard enough? There has been so much Messi talk that it is easy to forget how big an occasion this is for Kylian Mbappé, Antoine Griezmann and perhaps Ousmane Dembélé. “He’s fast, explosive, needs space, and I think he will have more space than in the first three matches,” Hugo Lloris said of Mbappé.Coming to a living room near you:Straight to that talk of Lionel Messi dictating Jorge Sampaoli’s in-game tactics, with reports that the Argentina coach sought the approval of the Barcelona forward against Nigeria, asking him if it would be OK to bring on Sergio Agüero. “We looked at different options in an important game and had to make a decision,” Sampaoli said. “I was simply communicating this, saying we were going to use a strategy we had rehearsed to use more attacking players. It was a simple exchange I had with one of my players, that is all.”Yesterday was kind of rubbish, a devastating lull as the last 16 readied itself, but today we are back, close to full throttle. There are not four games but a couple of Goats and two likely mouthwatering match-ups. Some, I see, are calling it Super Saturday, which speaks volumes of the magnitude, doesn’t it? We’ll be building up to France v Argentina (3pm BST) and Uruguay v Portugal (7pm), as well as soaking up all the other goings-on from around Russia and beyond.Right, that’s about all you need from me for today. Ben Fisher will be taking over shortly to shepherd you closer to kick-off in that belting last 16 match between France and Argentina. Thanks for your company, I’ll see you here again soon.“Morning Jonathan! It’s me, David Not-That-One Penney,” Morning Dave Penney (not that Dave Penney) great to have you on board again.“We may not have a CAF team which is sad, but Japan to represent Asia is good? And two Scandinavian teams when for the past 15 years they’ve success has been pretty abject is worth celebrating?” Absolutely it is Dave, the more ersity the better.Gokul Kannan is the latest emailer uninterested in the Messi vs. Ronaldo storyline that could eventuate in the quarterfinals. “I still don’t understand the fascination of a Messi vs Ronaldo matchup in this World Cup. They play against each other every year, and we all know how it goes. This will not be something rare to savour. The prospect of club teammates playing against each other is what makes these type of tournaments interesting. Exhibit 1: Rooney vs Ronaldo WC 2006. Exhibit 2: Gerrard vs Suarez WC 2014.”The end of the group stage unfortunately also means the end of African participation in Russia 2018. Paul Doyle takes a look at why it’s been a World Cup to forget for the CAF.Beyond those inidual issues one could point to a couple of curious weaknesses that African teams (but not only African teams) displayed during this tournament: flawed defending from set-pieces and a lack of deadly predators. That again raises questions about iniduals but also alludes to the wider issue shared by many African countries: incomplete honing of potential.Simon Burnton has trawled through all the group stage stats, sifted through the data and hand picked some choice morsels for your delectation. It does make you wonder how Germany managed to cock things up so spectacularly and how Toni Kroos is particularly unfortunate to be heading home. “I suppose a lot of people would suggest Evita as Argentina’s musical, but the way they’ve sputtered into the round of 16, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is more like it,” emails Peter Oh. As we’re shifting from the World Cup group phase to the knockouts it seems only fair we annoy everyone with crowdsourced opinions about the best and worst XIs of the tournament so far.Here’s your best, which I have to say, restores my faith somewhat in the wisdom of crowds.And from the tops, to the flops. I feel for David de Gea in this list. Yes he made a clanger against Portugal but that’s only one mistake compared to the repeat calamities endured by many other gloveman.Have you suddenly contracted World Cup fever? Has the unfolding draw convinced you to book the holiday of a lifetime? Martha Kelner has all you need to know before you head to the travel agents.You better familiarise yourself with this Aidan.Some suggestions (not great it has to be said) have arrived to bolster the theme of World Cup teams as musical theatre shows.Sweden are Mamma Mia (thanks to Abba), England are Spamalot, and Brazil are Sweeney Todd (courtesy of Neymar’s demon barber). Time for a little snack break.Well Jim, Uruguay, France and Argentina are all in the same quarter of the draw competing for one semi-final spot. Brazil are in the opposite quarter of that half of the draw, so the chances of at least one former winner making the final must be pretty high.The other half of the draw is more open but a Spain vs. England semifinal is not out of the question. So, for all the chaos of the group phase my money would still be on a former winner once again prevailing. For what it’s worth, my two wildcard picks would be Croatia and Colombia.While all eyes have been on Ronaldo, one of the highlights of Portugal’s campaign so far has been provided by Ricardo Quaresma. As Barney Ronay points out, the Portuguese winger has made the trivela (striking the ball with the outside of his right boot) his signature move.An entire column about kicking the ball with the outside of your foot: nobody’s going to read that, said every sensible newspaper desk editor ever. But they will, because everyone loves the trivela. The players you’ve loved down the years have loved doing it. The great Serbian midfielder Dragan Stojkovic has YouTube videos dedicated solely to his use of the lofted back-spun trivela pass, a man for whom the entire world was interpreted through the outside of his right foot.Changing tack slightly to the second game of the day, Uruguay vs. Portugal. Sid Lowe is all over this one with yet another clasico subplot to enjoy.The Madrid derby and the clásico recreated. Pepe v Suárez, Godín v Ronaldo. There is plenty of previous. There’s Ronaldo and Godín battling in the area, Ronaldo punching Godín in the back of the head. There’s Suárez catching Pepe with a hand across the face one time and a boot across the shin another, the defender rolling round the turf with hand in the air, calling for the priest to deliver his last rites after both of them.“While I imagine the pundits and fanboys are salivating at the prospect of a Messi vs Ronaldo quarter final, I must say that I am hoping for the exact opposite,” emails Simon Horwell. “France vs Uruguay please. The only entertainment stain on this World Cup - aside from the soul crushing ineptitude of Fox’s coverage here in the US - has been the ad nauseam Messi vs Ronaldo narrative. As if there aren’t 700+ others players to talk about. The sooner both go home, the better.”This is a point I can empathise with but ultimately disagree with. What is the World Cup for if not the grand narratives of our age? Messi and Ronaldo are not just good players, they are transcendent, and belong in conversation with the very best of all time. How often have such worlds collided on the biggest stage? Cruyff and Beckenbauer in ‘74, Maradona and Hodge in ‘86? I am as curmudgeonly as the next ex-pat Yorkshireman but even I don’t begrudge the clash of the titans narrative on this one. Jonathan Wilson has cast his analytical eye over the indomitable Javier Mascherano.Amid the panic, amid the fury, amid the hopelessly ambitious through-balls and dismal crosses, there was still that, the bronca, the spirit of defiance that so often fired Diego Maradona, that has in the past so often propelled Argentina. At least twice, Mascherano gave the ball away then charged back to reclaim it with a tackle. In his refusal to shirk responsibility, he was relentless.“As a kid I lived in France so I’m rooting for France,” emails Kari Tulinius, “but I wouldn’t begrudge Messi going on to the quarters, especially if he met Portugal. Though Uruguay-Argentina would be a heck of a game too. And Uruguay-France would be a meeting of the two most impressive defensive units on this side of the draw. One player that hasn’t been getting enough praise is Raphaël Varane. He’s got a “none shall pass” vibe about him this year. France could Italy their way to the final with a series of 1-0 wins.”Thanks Kari, interesting question in there: would French supporters be happy with ‘Italying’ their way to a World Cup win? Clearly there’s something in the DNA of Italian football that values defensive pragmatism but is it the same elsewhere in the world and in France in particular? Jorge Valdano has been an outstanding addition to ’s World Cup coverage and the Argentinian’s latest column espouses the glory of drama and emotion in an era of certainty and data.Of course the data helps but in the world of play, like in art, we have to put a limit on it because these are realms of freedom. The big problem is that with every step we take towards “scientific certainties”, players lose a little more freedom. Freedom for what? To think. There’s a reason they’re the protagonists.The Tweet from Michael Nyman started me thinking. Both France and Argentina can be understood through music - well, musical theatre. The story of France in Les Miserables, modern Argentina acting as the backdrop to Evita. Are any other World Cup contenders addressed in this fashion? Has anyone ever done a World Cup of musicals, Grantland-style?The draw dictates this mega head-to-head would be in the quarterfinals, but yes, I can’t see anybody not wanting to watch that particular scene unfold.Speaking of the draw, I’m trying unsuccessfully to link to the wallchart on the site. It is here though, if you’re looking for it.Absolutely not Michael, especially if you are the Michael Nyman. Although as they are now on the same half of the draw your dream can only come true in the semis. Graham Dwyer with the opening email of the day. “Today is like two finals in one day. Can’t wait for Argentina to stuff the French and Uruguay to demolish Portugal.”Very pro-South America for Graham. Is that a common feeling among neutrals? My own personal preference would be France and Portugal.Although for all France’s problems they cruised through the group phase, unlike Argentina.  columnist Marcel Desailly shares his experience of underperforming at a World Cup and questions Argentina’s direction under Jorge Sampaoli.We know Messi is great but we’re confused and sad for him. He is such a pure Barcelona product but with Argentina right now Messi’s in a mess. Something is missing – is it unity, faith? Messi doesn’t seem to fit into the collective. They have so many talented strikers, so many skilful attacking players and yet they don’t seem to know how to get the best out of them. They are really struggling. Is it the system? Is there a certain spirit missing?Despite a surfeit of superstars France have yet to set the tournament alight. Now they face the prospect of having to click into gear in attack while simultaneously combatting one Lionel Messi in defence. No easy feat.Let’s start the day 17 ball rolling with an upbeat Barney Ronay setting the scene for the knockout stages. This has felt like a genuinely epic-scale World Cup, football in a big country, with a vast bloom of interest and history in every city. The weather will now change, with a more staccato feel to the more micro-managed drama of knockout football. Over to you, part two. It won’t be an easy act to follow.Remember yesterday, when there was no football to watch? It was horrible, wasn’t it? Well, fear not. Normal life, a functioning circadian rhythm, and conversations about the weather can be shelved for another day because today we will be served more glorious World Cup football.First on the agenda is France vs. Argentina, a pairing that would grace a World Cup final but will instead kick-off the round of 16. Following that blockbuster Uruguay and Portugal will put their credentials to the test in a match with the potential to redefine footballing bastardy. So dig out your remote from the back of the sofa, pile up your salty snackfoods and caffeinated beverages and tuck into a massive plateful of Messi, Ronaldo, Suarez, Pogba and the rest. It’s going to be glorious.And don’t forget to join in. Emails should be sent to jonathan.howcroft.freelance@ and tweets to @JPHowcroft. It’s what the badger’s would want.

Yet gaps in the criminal justice system, ruthlessly exploited by sex traffickers, make escape almost impossibleby  Annie Kelly and  Mei-Ling McNamaraKate had spent three years behind bars at Lowell Correctional Institution, Florida’s largest women’s prison, when the letters from Richard Rawls started to arrive.Men had written to Kate in prison before, but this time was different. Although she had never met him, Rawls made her feel special. He wrote that he’d seen her mugshot online and couldn’t stop thinking about her. Somehow aware that she was getting out soon, he offered her money, a home and unconditional love when she was released.The letters promised Kate a future she never imagined possible – a way out of the cycle of prostitution and incarceration that had defined her life after a childhood of chaos and abuse. Soon, Rawls stopped signing his letters “Rick” instead, he urged her: “Come on home to your daddy.”“When you’re in prison, all you think about is getting out,” Kate says. “The hours go by and it really hurts to know that nobody thinks about you in there.“So when you get a letter it’s like a gift from God. He told me everything that I wanted to hear. He said I wasn’t going to be a prostitute any more, that I could go home with him and live at his house, and that he would be the love that I was searching for.”When Kate walked out of prison, Rawls, a career criminal and convicted felon with more than 47 charges for sexual battery, child abuse, drug possession and assault, was there to pick her up. Just as he had promised.“When I got into the car, he’d brought me two sweater dresses, a bottle of Heineken and a lot of crack,” she says. “I went right back to smoking crack my first day out of prison.”When she got back to Rawls’ house, Kate knew immediately she was in trouble. Instead of the comfortable home she had been promised, the house was filthy and chaotic. Cockroaches crawled up the walls. The windows were sealed shut. And hungry, chained pit bull dogs whined and barked outside. Inside the house, Kate found half a dozen other former Lowell inmates.“It was just crazy in there, really a living hell,” she says. “At first he gave me all the drugs I wanted, but he made sure that I watched him beat the other girls and I wasn’t allowed to leave his room. Then, after two weeks, it switched up and he started telling me that I owed him for all the drugs he’d given me, and now I had to go make him money.”Four months later, a heavily armed Swat team blew in the windows of the house and arrested Rawls, who was later convicted and jailed for human trafficking.An 18-month police investigation concluded that, over the course of five years, Rawls had trafficked Kate and at least 18 other women out of jails and prisons across Florida.At the time of his arrest, he was making thousands of dollars a month from prostituting the multiple women he was keeping at the house. Controlling them with narcotics, prescription pills and brutal beatings, he touted them on street corners and escort websites.Rawls remains the only person convicted of trafficking women out of criminal justice institutions in the US. Yet his case is by no means exceptional.A Observer investigation has found that jailhouses and prison cells across the US are routinely used as recruiting grounds by pimps and sex buyers. Exploiting gaps in the criminal justice system, predators are targeting some of the country’s most vulnerable and isolated women, trapping many in an endless loop of criminalisation and exploitation.State to state, the recruitment methods being used to target victims are broadly the same.The first stage involves finding potential victims. US public record legislation means that, in many states, anyone charged with a criminal offence will have their personal data posted on government websites. The information can include mugshots, home addresses and details of criminal records. In some states, details of arrests and charges are also printed in local newspapers. This means predators can cherrypick potential targets, find where women are being held, and on what charges, and – in some cases – learn when they are likely to be released. Information posted online can also include information on bail bonds set for women awaiting court dates. Becki, a trafficking survivor from Cincinnati, Ohio, said that in 10 years coming in and out of the criminal justice system, she routinely witnessed pimps and sex buyers using corrupt bail bondsmen to access women in jailhouses.Inside prisons and jails, the use of prison and jail commissary accounts – which allow inmates to receive money from outside to spend on food, toiletries and other essentials – is a key vehicle for recruitment. In many facilities, anybody can send money to an inmate.This means that many women are, in effect, financially supported through incarceration by men on the outside, who then demand repayment when they are released.Traffickers are also using inmate bank accounts to pay in-house recruiters to scout out potential targets. “When I was in prison I’d speak to my pimp every week and tell him about what new girls had come in and then he’d send me money,” said Chloe, a former inmate at a state prison in Ohio. “I’d tell the girl he wanted whatever they needed to hear to make sure she got in that car with him when she left. It was like ordering food off a menu.”In a remote and dusty prison complex in Venus, Texas, Anthony Harris, a former pimp who who was convicted of compelling prostitution in 2015, laughs when he is asked if he’s heard about pimps recruiting women from prisons and jails.When women are released, pimps wait outside to collect them “like a line of cabs”, says Harris.Over the course of the investigation, the  was granted access inside the Western Massachusetts Regional Women’s Correctional Center. It is one of the few institutions that acknowledges it has an issue with the trafficking of inmates.Nicole Bell, a trafficking survivor and founder of Lift, a local anti-trafficking organisation, runs workshops inside the jail to prevent inmates being groomed and recruited by pimps and sex buyers. She was repeatedly incarcerated at the jail when she was in the grip of addiction and prostitution on the streets of Worcester. “Trafficking for many of these women started with a relationship that turned exploitative, or a past that has led them to drug use – but because they’re involved in prostitution and addiction and have a criminal record, they’re treated like a throwaway population,” Bell says.In the US, trafficking is defined by exploitation, with victims controlled through fraud, force or coercion.“These woman have been hurt and exploited by people their whole lives, but society doesn’t care what happens to them,” says Bell. Inside the jail, female inmates showed letters from men they didn’t know. In an effort to befriend them, the senders offered to send them cash and provide them with money, drugs and housing after their release. This grooming process often goes on for months. “It gets so lonely in here,” says Jill, 24, her tiny frame swamped by a baggy regulation orange jumpsuit. This is her 22nd time in the jailhouse. “I have a boyfriend on the outside but he lets me prostitute, so does he really love me? And he lies to me all the time. When you get the letters from these men, sometimes you want to believe what they’re telling you is real.”She shrugs her shoulders. “When you’re in jail, you’re all alone. Sometimes, without them we’d have nobody,” she says. “My family won’t help me.”Many of the women here know the men writing to them are pimps or sex buyers, but say that without their support they’d have nowhere to go when released.“I know girls who survive in here because of the men,” says Katrina, another inmate. “Imagine you’re in here for a year and they’re supporting you. What do you think they want when we get out? Imagine you say you don’t want to go back to disrespecting your body. That’s just not going to fly. Nothing’s for free, I’ve learned that.”While many women in America’s booming $9.5bn (£7.2bn) sex trade work independently, pimp-controlled prostitution is now widely acknowledged as one of the most brutal and pervasive forms of human trafficking in the US.Of the 20 trafficking survivors who contributed to the investigation, the majority alleged they had been arrested multiple times for crimes committed while they were under the control of a trafficker.“Vulnerable women who are being controlled and exploited continue to be arrested every day,” says Rebecca Bender, a national anti-trafficking advocate. She says a recent move in many states away from arresting women for prostitution has been falsely held up as a solution to the criminalisation of trafficking victims.“There is little awareness that many women in a trafficking situation are also forced into many different illegal activities, which make them a target for re-arrest by the police,” she says.The impact of having a criminal record often makes it impossible for women leaving incarceration to find employment and safe housing, or to regain custody of their children.“I try to help them when they get out but we don’t have a safe house, so when they’re released the traffickers are the ones who can help meet their basic needs,” says Bell. “It’s a matter of survival.”Solutions, say advocates like Bell and Bender, have to start inside the facilities themselves, where there is an urgent need for staff training and more interventions to support women.Since the Rawls case, the Department of Corrections in Florida has implemented anti-trafficking training and awareness measures designed to educate staff and inmates about human trafficking.In a statement to the , the Florida Department of Corrections said it had fully cooperated with the Rawls enquiry and added: “The department is committed to preventing human trafficking and working with our partners in law enforcement to ensure any inidual involved is criminally prosecuted. We take all allegations of this devastating crime very seriously, and have implemented aggressive measures to protect our most vulnerable populations from this enterprise.”For many, however, support either in prison or outside is simply not available. “These are some of the most vulnerable, high-risk iniduals in our society,” says Bell. “At the moment, most are just trapped in a continuous loop of abuse and exploitation.”• Living in Freedom Together supports survivors of sexual exploitation in Massachusetts"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f370cfbfd584ef0edfed773664b3613bcb9d47a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f40762e068d6534919ce5aaa610899c7","title":"a letter to my friend with benefits","story":"‘We would regularly congratulate ourselves on avoiding the complications of relationships.

Let our experts guide you through the hazardsThe Quentin Blake picture book, Zagazoo, tells the surreal story of George and Bella, who become parents after they unwrap a parcel containing a baby. The perfect baby becomes a baby vulture who screeches all night in toddlerdom, he’s a clumsy elephant. When Zagazoo hits the teen years, he turns into a hulking beast who becomes stranger and hairier by the minute, and they hit breaking point. Blake’s illustrations get wilder. George’s hair turns grey. “Suppose it never stops,” Bella panics. “It doesn’t bear thinking about,” George cries. “What will become of us?”It’s very funny, but it also conveys a powerful message about adolescence: that it’s something to dread, survive, tolerate – for children and parents. But does it have to be this way? We asked the experts, from our own advice columnist to counsellors, writers and gaming gurus, people with professional and personal experience of the teenage years. The result is our guide to embracing your adolescent, understanding the very real changes they’re undergoing, comprehending the world they inhabit – and perhaps taking a look at yourself, too.“Parents are biologically driven to protect their child, but in evolutionary terms, the protected child has to grow up and separate, and so the period of adolescence is there for that to happen,” says Nicola Morgan, who writes about teenagers.Morgan says this process is easier for teens, because they’re biologically programmed to separate, while the parents are still in protection mode. “There’s nothing in the parent brain that makes it want to separate from the child. The trouble happens when we try to protect for too long – that’s where, often, conflict comes.”“It’s OK to mourn the loss of the cuddly little person, but embrace the fact that they’re entering a new stage of life,” Relate counsellor Ammanda Major says.But don’t think your teenager doesn’t need you any more. “They absolutely do, even though they think they don’t,” Major says. “It’s just that it’s different from when they were a child and you were in total control.”Hormones and seismic growth throw adolescent brains into overdrive – and they don’t finish developing until their 20s. This is pure biology, and it means adolescents gravitate towards certain behaviours: emotional roller-coastering, so-called “bad” risk-taking, lower empathy, susceptibility to peer pressure and weaker impulse control.“Sometimes its immensely reassuring to know that there’s a biological reason behind some adolescent behaviour,” Morgan says. “If you’re in the thick of some challenging moments, keep that in mind.”This development of the brain also means sleep patterns are affected. Put simply, teenagers aren’t ready for bed when you want them to be, and they might struggle to get up in the morning. It’s useless to get into arguments over bedtimes – things have changed since they were toddlers you could sleep-train. No amount of arguing and rule-setting can beat biology. Instead, help them to change their routine where possible to accommodate a new pattern of sleep – even if it’s only at weekends.“Video games are a big part of childhood and teenage life, so getting to grips with them can be a window to understanding and engaging with your teenager,” says journalist and gamer Andy Robertson, author of Taming Gaming. “Clearly, if they play too much, or on their own in a bedroom, it can have an isolating effect.” His advice is to bring them out from the shadows, and make gaming more of a family-friendly activity. This requires getting involved early: “Avoid just setting limits when they are young – find games you want them to play.” Research the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) rating so you know which games are appropriate. PEGI ratings work like film classifications – from 3, suitable for three years old and above, to adult-appropriate 18s. There are also symbols showing what sort of content to expect, from scary scenes to sex. “Games can instil amazing character traits like perseverance, kindness, cooperation and strategic thinking,” he says. “And gaming health is about a balanced diet. With food, we don’t worry about plate time, it’s what’s on the plate that matters. Similarly, it’s what’s on the screen that’s important.” In other words, aimless YouTube surfing isn’t the same as time spent playing a well-planned strategic game together.“Also, don’t assume they don’t want you involved. Show some interest early, and you might have a connection for life.”If you’re just not interested in joining in, you can still set limits. Discuss with them how many hours a day they think it’s appropriate to play, what kind of games you are comfortable with. Make sure it’s a dialogue and that, although you are the ultimate arbiter, they still have some say.“There’s no doubt that the way you communicate will change,” Major says. “If you experience this, the rowing, the shouting, the melodrama or the silent treatment can feel very personal, but try not to take it as such.” Always keep the channels of communication open. Take the time to learn their language and when they might want to talk.For example, a face-to-face sit-down conversation across the table will be too confrontational. You should try to cultivate moments where “sideways” conversations happen, such as in the car or while walking or doing household chores together this way, things can be much more relaxed and they will often open up or be more receptive.Major is also at pains to remind parents to continue to include an adolescent in everything they might normally do as a family. “A grunt might actually mean, ‘Yes, please’, so keep them involved. Don’t feel hurt when they reject you enjoy it when they don’t.”Annalisa Barbieri, the ’s advice columnist, urges parents to see their children as separate beings from the word go. “What I don’t understand are parents who want their children to acquiesce when they’re little, but magically know their own minds when they’re a teenager – that’s where the difficulty seems to be.”Accept that the widening of the online landscape is probably the biggest difference between your own adolescence and that of your child’s. But remember, just as in real life, your teenagers will need boundaries in their virtual worlds.Keep tabs on what they get up to, Morgan says. Educate yourself, if necessary, but develop a mutual trust. “Only when we engage with the positives can we negotiate and encourage healthy behaviours.”Give them some tech responsibility at home – sorting out a dodgy Skype connection or, if they have younger siblings, ask them for help talking about online safety. Show trust where you can.To help them see that life’s not all online, let them choose an offline activity you can do together. It doesn’t matter what – climbing, cake decorating, whittling, kite-flying, surfing. It’ll give them a rush, a new skill – and some good social media pics.Finally, don’t forget to look at your own habits and set a good example. “It’s difficult to lay down the law if you can’t stop looking at your phone,” Morgan says. “Model good behaviour to them.”Many common mental health problems, such as depression, have their onset in early adolescence. Natasha Devon, a children’s mental health campaigner and the author of A Beginner’s Guide to Being Mental: An A-Z, often gets asked when “normal” teenage behaviour becomes a mental health issue. “It doesn’t matter. What if your partner said to you, ‘Is this really serious, or is this just the menopause?’ How would that make you feel? If someone genuinely shows interest in you and listens to you, then that improves your brain chemistry. Just listen to what they have to say.”“There seems to be a horrible ide between the generations, based on the fact that adolescents today are growing up in a technologically advanced age. What happens is parents end up telling their teens they should be happy because they’ve got more materially than they ever had. But material things don’t make you happy.”This rather toxic attitude towards teenagers is something that Barbieri sees too: “I think teenagers are scared of becoming teenagers because adults talk about it in a way that is so scary.”“Don’t forget your own partnership,” Major says. “Nurture each other. If you’re on your own, find some support. Act with your partner and don’t undermine each other.”Consider whether your reaction to your teenager’s behaviour is coloured by your own experiences. Major says: “Maybe you toed the line when you were an adolescent. If you have a youngster who isn’t doing that, be prepared to be jealous of their gutsy response – you might wish you’d done the same.”Revisiting your youth is important for maintaining your empathy and humour levels, Devon says. “Keep checking in with your teenage self – what would that person make of your adult life now?” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23195946bc5448d83ef1f8667d74f0b127af9489/0_259_8351_5012/master/8351.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0589cf2006dc6c015c9457a4b61c542c","title":"meera sodha recipe jersey royal istoo","story":"The subtle heat of black pepper pairs brilliantly with the tang of tamarind shallotsBlack pepper, once a highly prized spice for which kingdoms fell and men died, originates in India’s Malabar coast, where it’s one of the main spices of the local cuisine. When used as more than just a seasoning, as in this istoo (a corruption of the word ‘stew’), pepper adds a gentle, rounded heat, unlike the sharp hit you get from fresh chillies. The result is one of the most gentle-natured and elegant curries I’ve come across in all my travels across India.For the tamarind shallots 1½ tsp rapeseed oil ½ tsp mustard seeds5 curry leaves 8 shallots, peeled and cut lengthways into quarters 200g vine tomatoes (ie, 2 medium ones), chopped1 green chilli, very finely chopped 1-1½ tsp tamarind paste½ tsp salt ¼ tsp ground turmericFor the potato istoo2 tbsp rapeseed oil 10 curry leaves 4cm cinnamon stick, broken in two1 medium white onion, peeled and sliced 2cm piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated 4 garlic cloves, peeled and minced 1 green finger chilli, slit650g small jersey royal potatoes, quartered1 tsp each salt and black pepper 1 x 400ml tin coconut milk 250g green beans, tailed and halvedFor the shallots, heat the oil in a large frying pan on a medium flame. Once hot, add the mustard seeds and curry leaves and, when the seeds pop and the leaves crackle, lay in the shallots cut side down and leave to cook for five minutes, until browned. Now stir the shallots, encouraging the “petals” to break loose, and cook for another five minutes or so, until soft enough to cut with a wooden spoon. Add the tomatoes, chilli and two tablespoons of water, and cook until the tomatoes go jammy and break down into a paste (you may need to add more water). Add the tamarind, salt and turmeric, cook for two minutes, then take off the heat and set aside.In a casserole dish for which you have a lid, heat the oil for the istoo on a medium flame and, once hot, add the curry leaves, cinnamon and onion.

So, these days, I’m more than happy to mix the likes of tomatoes, watermelon or rhubarb with my punnet of strawberries, and watch the magic happen.I’ve called this a granita, because it’s no-churn and not entirely smooth, but it’s more like a sorbet, really. It’s incredibly refreshing, and the perfect end to a summer meal when you’re too full or hot to handle a rich dessert, but still need a sweet hit. Transfer it from the freezer to the fridge for five to 10 minutes before serving, to make it easier to scoop.½ small seedless watermelon, peeled, flesh cut into 2cm chunks (350g net weight)150g ripe strawberries, hulled, roughly chopped5g makrut lime leaves, stalks removed, then blitzed in a spice grinder (or very finely chopped)125g glucose4 limes – finely grate enough skin to get 2 tsp zest, then juice 2 to get 3 tbsp cut the rest into wedges, to serve2 tbsp vodka2 tsp caster sugarPut both fruits in a large container and freeze until solid – about two hours. Meanwhile, put two-thirds of the makrut lime leaves in a small saucepan with the glucose, lime juice and zest, and vodka, and gently heat on a medium flame until the glucose has melted and is warm. Leave to infuse, preferably for at least an hour, then reheat until warm and runny. Pass through a fine-mesh sieve, and discard the bits of lime leaf. Put the frozen fruit and makrut syrup in a blender, and blitz until smooth and slushy.Transfer everything to a container, cover with a lid or clingfilm, and freeze until firm – about three hours. Meanwhile, mix the remaining shredded lime leaves with the caster sugar. Serve the granita with a little lime sugar sprinkled on top and lime wedges alongside.The only time involved here is in the marinating of the onion in lemon and vinegar to create the most brilliant dressing. After that, all you have to do is toss everything together at the last minute (this salad doesn’t take kindly to being left to sit around) and serve with grilled fish or a range of similarly summery snacks.Prep 10 minPickle 1-2 hrCook 5 minServes 4 as a side1½ tbsp white-wine vinegar1 lemon – finely pare off 3 wide strips of peel then juice, to get 1 tbsp1 tsp caster sugarSalt and black pepper½ large red onion, peeled and finely sliced on a mandoline350g medium vine tomatoes, roughly cut into 4cm pieces 150g strawberries, hulled, cut in half lengthways, then into 5mm-thick slices5g basil leaves, roughly torn2½ tbsp olive oilWhisk the vinegar, lemon juice, sugar and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a small bowl, then add the onion and lemon peel, and leave to pickle for at least an hour, preferably two or longer, stirring a couple of times.

Meanwhile, drain the pickled onions, reserving the pickling liquid to use in the dressing.

Add the vinegar and water (start with a tablespoon and add more if you need it) and blitz again for 10-20 seconds, until the dough starts to come together. Tip out on to a work surface, shape into a ball, wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for about an hour.Heat the oven to 180C350Fgas 4. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out the pastry into a 2cm-thick rectangle about 32cm x 20cm. Carefully lift into a fluted rectangular tart tin that’s 16cm x 28cm with 3cm-high sides. Press the pastry into the corners and sides, allowing any excess to hang over the edges, then line with baking paper. Fill with baking beans (or uncooked rice or pulses) and bake for 25 minutes, until the edges of the pastry are golden brown. Remove the beans and paper, and bake for about 12 minutes more, until the base is also golden brown. Remove from the oven, trim off any overhanging pastry and leave to cool.Turn up the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Mix the strawberries and rhubarb with the sugar and put in a 16cm x 28cm ovenproof dish: you want the fruit to fit snugly. Bake for 12-13 minutes, until the sugar has melted and the fruit has softened but still keeps its shape. Set aside to cool down, then transfer two-thirds of the fruit (but not the cooking juices) to the pastry case, arranging it randomly. Set aside the remaining fruit and juices: you should have about 80ml juice. Turn down the oven to 170C335Fgas 3½.For the custard, put the egg yolks, cornflour, sugar and vanilla essence in a large bowl and whisk smooth. Gradually whisk in the cream until combined, then tip into a jug. Carefully pour the custard over the fruit, then bake for 30-45 minutes (timings will depend on your tart tin: a round tart will take longer to cook than a long one, for example), until the custard has set and turned golden brown in places on top.Remove from the oven, leave to cool, then transfer to the fridge to chill. Just before serving, remove the tart from its tin, spoon the reserved roast fruit and a few tablespoons of the syrupy juices lengthways down the centre, and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/388c51111d7210479d4f517e9e2eaffa51f0fdf2/0_166_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97592590f04502ceb74dee77a689731f","title":"in the red again george osborne leads evening standard to 10m loss","story":"Formerly profitable freesheet, edited by ex-chancellor, has spent big to develop its brandThe Evening Standard has reported a loss of £10m for last year to the end of September, as the cost of “strategic investment” under new editor George Osborne pushed the London free daily newspaper deep into the red.Parent company ESI Media, which is controlled by Russian oligarch Evgeny Lebedev, also reported that stablemate the Independent has almost doubled profits to £3.26m in its first full year as a digital-only publication.The company said the Evening Standard’s swing to a major loss was because it has embarked on a strategic investment programme to develop the brand, editorial product and advertising proposition. It made a £2.2m operating profit in 2016. In 2015, it made £3.3m.ESI Media said the investment phase included “strong editorial innovation under former chancellor George Osborne”, who controversially took over as editor in May last year. Since his appointment, there has been a comprehensive redesign of the paper and the word “London” has been dropped from the title to reflect greater national and international ambitions. The paper has also invested heavily in the event market, including a London food festival. However, the title, which has a circulation of almost 900,000, was also hit hard by the ongoing slump in the advertising market. As a freesheet, it does not have the benefit of additional income from sales of each copy, making it particularly vulnerable. “We’re investing significantly in the Evening Standard,” said Manish Malhotra, group managing director at ESI Media. “Although the title has been subject to some broader issues that have impacted on all news brands, the brand is now enjoying strong digital growth and the emergence of a successful events business to complement the print title reinvigorated under George’s editorship.”The Standard also took on costs as a result of the closure in 2016 of the print edition of stablemates the Independent and Independent on Sunday.Malhotra said: “The Independent is demonstrating strong growth in profits and turnover following its move to a digital-only business. This is enabling us to continually invest in the brand, particularly in our US presence, to better serve our large, engaged and valuable global audience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0297ff5544c92ee9dd2f8d041eb02b21dd68570c/0_169_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6e945d7fe2f40ee88272d02b47589c0","title":"driving holiday take car abroad insurance tolls","story":"From breakdown cover to tolls and getting a GB sticker, here’s what you need to knowNo one forgets the first time they drive their car off a ferry at the start of a motoring holiday abroad – either for the thrill of excitement, or the fear that comes with driving on the right for the first time. But it doesn’t have to be stressful if you follow the Money guide to taking your car away this summer. It just needs a bit of planning.Almost all UK car insurance polices automatically give drivers third-party cover across the EU, so it will pay out if the driver hits someone on Paris’s périphérique but not pick up the cost of damage to the driver’s car. If you want to have comprehensive cover for a trip abroad you need to contact your insurer.Some companies automatically extend a policyholder’s comprehensive cover abroad – for example, LV gives free cover for up to 180 days in Europe. Others will make you pay a surcharge, typically £40. It is worth noting that if you know you are going abroad during the year, it is often cheaper to add European cover when you take out the policy.It is a brave person who drives from London to Nice without this, but there is no obligation to buy it. If your car is relatively new and your UK breakdown cover is provided through your car’s manufacturer, you may find you already have European cover as standard.If you don’t, ask your provider to quote for a European upgrade. If it wants more than £50 for a two-week trip, you will be better off buying a standalone policy.GEM Motoring Assist, which wins Auto Express’s best provider award most years, quoted us £50 to take our 11-year-old car to Europe for two weeks. Euro Rescue is another firm to consider – it is a bit cheaper if you are travelling to France or the Benelux countries.Be sure to check the minimum car age, trailer cover, if it needs towing, as well as whether it offers a replacement hire car in the event yours cannot be repaired. Beware the cheapest European breakdown policies, which tend to be riddled with get-out clauses.Documents you need to takeIf you get pulled over, most European police will want to see your UK driving licence, an insurance cover note and – the one that catches UK drivers out – the car ownership, or V5, document. Having these will save you a lot of hassle and a potential on-the-spot fine.First up is the GB sticker, which is still required by most European countries. Next is something you may not carry at home – a red warning triangle that must be placed on the road if you break down. These are compulsory in France and Germany. Don’t pay Halfords £13 for one – Screwfix and eBay sell these for £5.It is a similar story for a reflective jacket – in most cases the driver must have one in the event of a breakdown. In Austria, a first-aid kit is compulsory, but it is not in other countries.Don’t forget to use a headlight adjustment kit to stop your headlights dazzling other road users. This can be bought for £8 at Halfords or £3.65 on Amazon. Remember, the lights on many estate cars can be manually lowered using the button on the dashboard.In France, you are obliged to carry a single-use breathalyser, but you can’t be penalised for not carrying one. The breathalyser has to be certified by the French authorities, showing an NF number. These are available in the UK for £3 online, or £5 at Halfords. French supermarkets sell them widely.France is covered in toll motorways and when you see the prices, you understand why these roads are often empty. The Via Michelin website says a driver going from Calais to Nice this summer will have to shell out €108 (£96) in tolls alone. With some planning you can avoid the tolls altogether, but be prepared for significantly longer journey times.If you are going to be doing a lot of driving in France consider getting a Sanef Télépéage tag. The toll prices are the same, but the windscreen-mounted tag allows buyers to use the special Télépéage lanes. The advantage is you avoid the long queues that can build up at toll booths.You can order the tag paying €41 up front from the Sanef UK website. The firm says it will send it out the same day if ordered by 2pm. The toll payments are taken by direct debit from your UK bank account. When you return the tag you get €20 back. The firm also offers tags for Spain and Portugal.Note that in some countries you can’t pay in cash at toll points as they use automatic number plate recognition only. For example, the M50 ring road around Dublin, Ireland, has camera-only €2.60 tolls. Don’t try to chance it by not paying as details are passed on to a UK debt recovery company, with the fine for non-payment set at €41.50 before the debt recovery firms add their fees. Instead, take a note of the number to call (displayed on the motorway) and pay by 8pm the following day.Satnav and radarIt is forbidden to carry, transport or use radar detectors in France. You could be fined heavily and have your vehicle and the device confiscated.The AA recommends that if you have a satnav capable of displaying camera locations in France you should disable camera alerts before driving in the country.French police in particular are strict on speeding, and radar traps, even on a Sunday afternoon outside a quiet village, are not unusual. The motorway maximum in France is 130kmh (80mph), while the urban speed limit is 50kmh (31mph). And don’t assume that in Germany all autobahns are free from speed limits – many have 130kmh limits in busy areas.If you haven’t booked your ferry, there’s still time to grab a bargain. This week the Ferries website was offering returns from Dover to Dunkirk with DFDS from £129 – leaving on a peak Saturday 14 July and returning two weeks later. If you prefer to travel to Calais – a much better option for onward travel into France – it would cost £140. This is for a family of four in a standard family car.Switch to the speedier Eurotunnel and the price rises to £257 for those peak-time dates.If you prefer to go from Newhaven to Dieppe, which gets you a bit further south, the price for the same dates rises to about £300 with DFDS. Brittany Ferries want £424 for Portsmouth-Le Havre.The overnight ferry from Portsmouth to St Malo comes in at £743 return – and that’s before you have added any cabin costs. Switch to Poole-Cherbourg and you can bring the cost down to £590.Depending on where you live in the UK, it is generally cheaper to take a Dover-Calais option and to drive the rest of the way. You’ll pay less in extra fuel and tolls than the increased ferry fares, and it probably works out just as quick – albeit with much more driving.

The scheme would be funded by a levy on housebuilders, with larger ones such as Berkeley Group, Persimmon, Barratt, Galliford Try, Redrow and Bovis Homes, paying more than small and medium-sized firms.A report, Better Redress for Home Buyers, by the all-party parliamentary group for excellence in the built environment, highlights the confusing landscape buyers face when trying to resolve building defects, not helped by a plethora of warranties, housebuilding codes and complaints procedures.It says the proposed ombudsman should be able to order payouts of up to £50,000 so buyers are not left out of pocket. Disputes over larger sums might have to be settled in court, but the report adds: “In certain extreme situations the new homes ombudsman should be able to reverse the sale.”The recommendations come after a scandal over the poor quality of new homes built by Bovis, while other housebuilders have also faced similar complaints.The parliamentarians have proposed a snagging app that would enable buyers to photograph defects and send them to the builder, monitor the progress of complaints and go to the ombudsman if needed.Dominic Raab, the housing minister, said this week that the “vice-like grip” of the big developers must be broken to boost the building of affordable homes.Lord Best, vice-chair of the all-party group, says: “Buying a new home is stressful enough, but buying a defective one, as we heard from witnesses, can take a toll on people’s wellbeing as they wrestle with a Kafkaesque system seemingly designed to be unhelpful.”The proposed scheme would be modelled on the property ombudsman, to which all estate agents must belong. If they are struck off, they can no longer trade.Katrine Sporle, the property ombudsman, says: “New homes should be covered by an ombudsman. People have no idea that when they buy a new home directly from the developer, they have no access to redress.”The proposed scheme would cover the first two years following a house purchase when housebuilders are liable for defects, while subsequent problems would be down to the warranty providers.The report says: “Affected homebuyers are exasperated not so much by the existence of defects but by a builder’s failure or even refusal to put them right. Submissions we received described how buying a new home had been ‘the worst decision of their life’ how it was like ‘going through hell’ as the complaint passed between housebuilders and warranty providers and how fighting for redress was taking a toll on their health.”The proposals have been presented to the ministry of housing, communities and local government as part of its consultation on a single housing ombudsman."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7d283aa3a34f165fbb0a4fd407f0afa968591fe/0_97_3436_2063/master/3436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce61717151f670b11b45ba4a18f44cf8","title":"transport for london hoards 321m from dormant oyster cards","story":"As travel card marks 15 years, bosses ‘incredibly quiet’ about credit left unused in contactless era, say Lib DemsTransport for London (TfL) is being urged to encourage more people to get their money back from dormant Oyster cards on the 15th anniversary of the electronic travel cards.Caroline Pidgeon, Lib Dem member of the London Assembly, accused transport bosses of being “incredibly quiet” about highlighting the “cash mountain” from money left on cards.The balances and deposits on Oyster cards that have not been used for at least a year stands at more than £321 million, TfL figures show.Ms Pidgeon went on: “The total amount left on dormant Oyster cards is soaring, almost certainly in part due to the increasing number of people who have switched to contactless payment.“TfL never stops bombarding us with advertisements and information campaigns, but highlighting this cash mountain is one issue that they remain incredibly quiet about.“It is time TfL devoted far more time and energy telling the public how they can get their own money back.”More than 100 million people have used Oyster cards since they were launched on 30 June 2003."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6f980c6f0afc2cfcca9a24d10f4347e9ae33ec2/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc81e5e8e6b9ceba170c2305090b93df","title":"drake scorpion review","story":"Veering from swaggering soul to eerie electronica, this mega-album is bloated, rambling – yet frequently gorgeous and funnyOn an album filled with revelations, perhaps the most startling one arrives during Can’t Take a Joke (a song that would win the award for the most Drake-esque title in history were it not for the existence of his recent single I’m Upset): Drake reads the comments. Moreover, he says, the comments are “killing me”, so much so that the personal note written by Drake and attached to Scorpion is entirely comprised of negative ones: DRAKE IS FINISHED, DRAKE IS A POP ARTIST, DRAKE MAKES MUSIC FOR GIRLS, etc.That seems astonishing on one level, and offers a curious insight into the life of one of the most successful artists of his era. It would appear that a man who’s had more Billboard Hot 100 hits than any solo artist in history spends his time sequestered away in his $8m Hidden Hills mansion ignoring the entreaties of neighbours Miley Cyrus and LeAnn Rimes to join them for a boozy barbecue in favour of rummaging around below the line and fulminating over what baz_27 has to say about him. “Scrolling through life and fishing for praise,” he offers on Emotionless, as a sample of Mariah Carey’s Emotions wails in the background. “Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways.”But on another level: well, of course he does. From the start, Drake’s whole schtick has revolved around solipsism and self-pity – how could he resist such a rich seam of inspiration, so many reasons to feel sorry for himself?If it’s true, then he can hardly have missed the gag that began circulating online when Scorpion was announced as two albums – one rap, one R\u0026ampB – prompting a wag on Twitter to remark, “Biggie released a double after he died too”, earning himself 12,000 retweets in the process, the joke being that Drake seems to have come off noticeably the worse in his beef with Pusha-T and Kanye West.Said beef shows no sign of letting up over the course of Scorpion. On the album closer, March 14, he deals with Pusha’s big allegation – that Drake fathered a secret son – in a way that you have to say is impressively on-brand. Above sparse backing involving nothing more than drums and an impressively warped, psychedelic D’Angelo sample, he admits the “harsh truth”, promises to be there for his child, then turns his attention to underlining the real victim in all of this, which, with a certain thundering inevitability, turns out to be Drake. “I’m out there on the front lines, trying to make sure that I see him sometimes, it’s breaking my spirit,” he raps, before breaking into an old Boyz II Men song: “No one to cry on, I’m all alone, I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain.”Elsewhere, Drake takes aim at West’s line about him being light-skinned, mocks him for the 2016 rumours that he was $56m in debt and huffs that West and Pusha-T’s recent albums were of uneven quality: “When I heard the shit I was skipping through that.” He sounds committed – as if the ongoing war of words has forced him on to his mettle – and he has a point, although one might reasonably respond: look who’s talking. You can understand Drake’s desire to make a grandiose statement that covers every musical base from trap to the 90s R\u0026ampB slow jam of After Dark, but the problem with Scorpion is that there isn’t quite enough strong material here to support its gargantuan running time. There is audible flab in the flat I’m Upset and Nonstop, and the featherweight pop of Ratchet Happy Birthday. Some missteps seem baffling – Mob Ties, a dreary, by-numbers homage to Migos frankly feels a bit beneath him – and others overly familiar: Finesse is another one of those minor, melodically rambling Drake tracks that gives every impression that he’s just making it up as he goes along.It’s infuriating because Scorpion is frequently fantastic, making a stronger claim for Drake’s greatness than any amount of swaggering braggadocio. Don’t Matter to Me isolates a Michael Jackson sample (from an unreleased vocal cleared by Jackson’s estate) over pillowy synthesisers, emphasising the overlooked eeriness of his voice. Summer Games is a bold exercise in minimalism – an electronic riff that consists of one note runs through the entire song – and feels hypnotic rather than wearying. The DJ Premier-produced Sandra’s Rose is a gorgeous confection of old soul samples and churchy organ.For an artist who’s not exactly renowned for his sense of humour, there’s a real wit about In My Feelings’ incorporation of a scene referencing Drake in Donald Glover’s TV comedy Atlanta. And if Finesse represents Drake’s Auto-Tuned meandering at its most shaggy, then Peak shows that approach at its best: crawl-paced and authentically weird, its atmosphere of small-hours melancholy supported by harsh electronic tones and the unexpected sound of British MC Stefflon Don and some schoolfriends discussing the state of their love lives.Whatever anyone’s saying in the comments section or on social media, Drake is such a huge star that Scorpion is a guaranteed smash. You wouldn’t be surprised if it breaks yet another streaming record. But the fact that it’s a good album that could have been great had a firmer editing hand been applied perhaps tells you more about the isolation of mega-fame than any of its author’s depictions of moneyed angst: it offers the sound of a world in which no one will tell a superstar that enough is enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbd9713858c5fffb007e13f9aa2d3472ccb43c61/567_327_3410_2046/master/3410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9fe36a1ddeb66a7e70628b4c42de16ba","title":"gb sprinters linford christie 100m record","story":"Reece Prescod, Zharnel Hughes and CJ Ujah lead the race to break 25-year-old record at national trials in BirminghamIt is one of the most prestigious and robust records in British track and field history. But shortly after tea-time on Saturday, Linford Christie’s national 100m best of 9.87sec – which has stood for 25 years – could finally be toppled.It speaks volumes for the strength in depth of British sprinting that there are three athletes with the speed in their legs, and the fire in their bellies, at the British Championships in Birmingham.Reece Prescod, who has run a wind-assisted 9.88sec and beat the world champion, Justin Gatlin, in May, said: “Everyone is raising their game and we have a really competitive field in Birmingham. It is probably the best ever 100m at trials. The record could definitely go on the right conditions and the right day.”Zharnel Hughes, who ran a personal best of 9.91sec this month, is even bolder. “The crowd will be in for something spectacular,” he said. “I’m not putting any expectations on myself but records are meant to be broken.”CJ Ujah, the reigning Diamond League 100m champion, is also gunning for Christie’s record, set in Stuttgart in 1993, as well as one of the three places on offer for the European Championships in August while Ojie Edoburun, who set a personal best of 10.04 three weeks ago, cannot be discounted.The expectation is that Prescod, who has kicked on impressively after finishing seventh in last year’s world championships, is the man to beat. Especially as he believes his recent performances only hint at his potential. “There is no limit to speed,” he said. “I still have so much to work on, so I know I can go faster than 9.8, so in the 9.7s. It won’t happen overnight but in a few years when I have got stronger and worked on my start a lot more, I feel like anything is possible.“If I told myself last year I would run 9.88 windy, I would have said no way, but you have to surprise yourself. Things happen.”In the past, the 100m was the ultimate mano a mano contest, with athletes glaring and talking the talk in the call room in an attempt to unsettle their rivals. But Prescod insists that there is no animosity among the new wave of British sprinters, who realise that if they get on with each other it can enhance their chances of a 4x100m relay gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.“Back in the day it was eyeballing, and who was the strongest man in the call room, but to me that is just a waste of energy,” Prescod said. “So I don’t go out there all angry. I have a little dance, set the blocks down and go. I am still young, I can’t be angry.”Even if Christie’s record does not fall in Birmingham there is a looming sense that it is on borrowed time, especially given that Prescod, Hughes and Edoburun are only 22, while Ujah is 24.The men’s 100m is the highlight of two days of competition that organisers hope will put British athletics back on the sporting map before next month’s World Cup – which a worryingly high number of big names are set to swerve – and the Anniversary Games a week later at the London Stadium.Last year, the UK trials had a distinct lack of stars – Mo Farah, Greg Rutherford, Laura Muir and Katarina Johnson-Thompson were all missing – and an absence of bums on seats. To make matters worse, when Ujah broke 10 seconds for the 100m, it took 10 minutes for his time to show because of technical problems.This time, though, most of the big names are back – although Rutherford misses out because of appendicitis and Farah has since quit the track – and UK Athletics insists that ticket sales for the two days are up.Other highlights of the weekend include Dina Asher-Smith and Muir in the women’s 100m and 1500m respectively, while Shara Proctor and Lorraine Ugen, who finished third and fourth in the Commonwealth Games, square off in the long jump.In a stacked men’s 1500m, Chris O’Hare is a slight favourite ahead of Jake Wightman, the NCAA champion, Josh Kerr and Charlie Grice.In the men’s 800m, Kyle Langford, who was fourth in the world championships last year, has a stiff challenge against Elliot Giles and Andrew Osagie, who is looking to put a long run of injuries behind him since running 1min 43.77sec in the final of London 2012 and earning bronze in the world indoors in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b67c8ea098f3435d5c09cf1e775eabd2dbbf1b7e/372_558_4942_2965/master/4942.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7b8752c6322d4959c4ac30505c87afb","title":"talking horses natural scenery northumberland plate","story":"Beaten just half a length in last year’s Northumberland Plate, Natural Scenery (Newcastle 2.05) is taken to go one place better when they run the race once more on SaturdayBeaten just half a length in last year’s running of the Northumberland Plate, Natural Scenery (2.05) is taken to go one place better when they run the race once more on Saturday. The Godolphin mare has an excellent record on the Tapeta at Newcastle, having won on both her other starts here, and looks pretty well handicapped too.An arguably unlucky third in the Ebor in August, she is somehow 4lb below the mark she had that day, having raced just once in Britain since then. Her spring form in Meydan was fair but the impression is that a second assault on this race has been the basic plan for her for the last 12 months. She can give a welcome boost to the underachieving stable of Saeed bin Suroor, at odds of around 10-1.Withhold was undeniably well treated when storming home in the Cesarewitch but he’s 12lb higher now and hasn’t been seen for eight months. Higher Power, last year’s winner, is feared more.12.20 Newcastle He’s been dropped 1lb for finishing 11th on Guineas weekend but Ekhtiyaar was only beaten two and a half lengths that day after trouble in running and, on ratings, it was a 5lb better effort than on his reappearance. He didn’t peak until July last year and it’s reasonable to expect that he has more to offer.12.55 Newcastle An unlucky third in this race a year ago, Kimberella has already been in grand form this year, going down by just a nose to Sir Dancealot at Hamilton when last seen. Given a clear run through, he should go close at least.1.10 Newmarket A five-length success on her debut at Goodwood was really impressive from Impulsion and was achieved despite evident greenness. She’ll have to be straighter to win this Listed contest but that seems likely.1.30 Newcastle No fewer than four of these carry penalties for recent successes, though surely there will not be many who expect the frustrating Suegioo to follow up on his first success for four years, now that he is chucked into such a hot contest. From the in-form yard of Iain Jardine, Bedrock makes more appeal, his recent Flat form being an improvement on what he showed before trying hurdles.5.15 The Curragh You’ll need At The Races to watch it live but the Irish Derby is by far the most significant horse race run in Britain or Ireland on Saturday. For many, it will boil down to a simple question of whether Saxon Warrior can leave behind the disappointment of his fourth at Epsom, now that he tackles a more conventional track. He looked a talented Guineas winner in May and clearly must be feared but it’s surprising that anyone is prepared to back him at odds of 8-11. There must be a big chance that his Epsom running is a fair reflection of his ability at this distance, in which case this is a very open contest. Dee Ex Bee will surely run his usual game race and Delano Roosevelt is better than he showed at Ascot. But the value could be 20-1 about Joseph O’Brien’s Latrobe, who has been a bit of a talking horse and may finally be getting his act together, having belatedly broken his duck here three weeks ago. He probably needs this distance and perhaps even further. It’s not hard to imagine him running on into the argument up the long straight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a2da46877986069e00900cdcb5b22468a2d3a6a/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ef5a1e5020b073f37b861e5cf2ccb1","title":"50 shows to see at the edinburgh fringe 2018","story":"Superstar standups, daring dance, Brexit cabaret and a Bon Jovi musical … Dive into our guide to some of the shows at the world’s biggest arts festivalby  Brian Logan and  Chris WiegandAs ever on the fringe, a handful of big hitters return to reconnect to their standup roots. The pick of this year’s crop – which includes Marcus Brigstocke, Nina Conti, David O’Doherty and Reg Hunter – must be Rhod Gilbert, who made his name (and narrowly missed out on a Perrier award) with his volcanically exasperated fringe shows in the mid-noughties. Now he’s back, for just a short run, performing his first live comedy in six years.The programme at Dance Base features work from 11 countries and includes the Grassmarket venue’s first full-scale ballet, Giselle by Ballet Ireland. But the eye-catcher on this year’s lineup is Sunshine Boy, Andy Howitt’s tribute to the extravagantly lipsticked Leigh Bowery – performance artist, designer, sitter for Lucian Freud, Clothes Show star and legend of London’s club world, whose signature act involved giving birth to his partner on stage.Her 2016 debut made waves, her 2017 follow-up, Sassy Best Friend, was wonderful. This time out, the high-energy, highly-strung standup Rose Matafeo tackles horniness, of all things, and – in a year when Flight of the Conchords’ return has towered over live comedy – is part of a Kiwi invasion that includes “Lorde’s favourite comedian” Paul Williams, newcomer Alice Snedden and an all-new show from the big-hitting mime act Tape Face.His 2012 show BigMouth was an arresting collision of speeches from the Greeks to George W Bush – told with a splash of Sondheim and Nirvana – that explored how words can lead to war. Now, in a new performance, Valentijn Dhaenens returns once more to deadly rhetoric and to what makes politicians tick.The title sounds like something you’d be promised amid the flyering blizzard on the Royal Mile. But the signs look good for this monologue, co-produced by Manchester’s Royal Exchange and performed by Julie Hesmondhalgh. It was written in secret for her by her husband, Ian Kershaw, and promises, she says, to offer “a bit of love and hope”.Two credits guaranteed to give your comedy career a head start are “Gaulier-trained” and “directed by Cal McCrystal”. The Boosh and Spymonkey guru helped ex-clown student and former Plague of Idiots frontman Damien Warren-Smith create this spoof theatre masterclass, which won awards at both the Adelaide and Brighton festivals. Expect Shakespeare, butoh and Pinter takedowns, and – you have been warned – hands-on audience participation.There has been no shortage of comedy treatments of the whole Brexit farrago, but this one might cut the self-styled “bad boys of Brexit” deepest, as Messrs Johnson, Farage and co get a queer-cabaret makeover. At its work-in-progress stage, the barfly of Thanet was played by the fabulous Le Gateau Chocolat – a casting dream! – while the show’s Edinburgh preview will feature powerhouse singer and comedian Jayde Adams as the foreign secretary. Richard Thomas (Jerry Springer – the Opera) writes the tunes.Styled as a disarmingly jaunty joint lecture, Michael Pinchbeck’s multimedia show revisits John Berger and photographer Jean Mohr’s account of the life of an English country GP. Grounded in Berger’s thinking about art and perspective, it asks what drives a doctor who rises at night and slips an overcoat over his pyjamas to cross fields and answer his patient’s call – and, as the NHS marks 70 years, what drives today’s overloaded medics.An Oscar-winning actor, a director and a playwright are at loggerheads while preparing a production in this world premiere by David Ireland. The warning that it is “not for the faint of heart” will be acknowledged by anyone who saw Ireland’s blistering Cyprus Avenue, which starred Stephen Rea as an Ulster loyalist who sees the face of Gerry Adams in his baby granddaughter.No pressure, Sam Campbell, but the last three winners of the Melbourne comedy festival’s Barry award have gone on to be nominated for its Edinburgh equivalent. (Two of them – Sam Simmons and Hannah Gadsby – won it.) Oddball Sydney-based comic Campbell bagged this year’s gong with his absurdist sketch show The Trough, and its Edinburgh run spearheads another strong Aussie showing (including eye-catching newcomers Ivan Aristeguieta, Laura Davis and Heidi Regan) in Edinburgh.In the opening of JG Ballard’s 1974 novel Concrete Island, the architect hero overturns his Jaguar after screeching down a high-speed exit lane. Glasgow-based performer Mele Broomes presents her full-throttle, one-woman dance version of the cult classic to a pulsating soundscape and a blizzard of projections.You can’t accuse Kiri Pritchard-McLean of bandwagon-jumping. She made her show about sexism in comedy, Hysterical Woman, long before #MeToo. Its follow-up, Appropriate Adult, made remarkably lively comedy out of her experiences mentoring vulnerable kids. But this year’s show, in which the impressive Welsh comic explores gaslighting, is undoubtedly of-the-moment.A Bon Jovi musical imagined each night with the help of the audience? Writer-performer Paul O’Donnell is making his fringe debut and may well be livin’ on a prayer but he’ll make it he swears. O’Donnell turns the story of Tommy (used to work on the docks) and Gina (works the diner all day) into a zero-budget musical epic. This late-night show might just have Edinburgh hit written all over it.It won’t come as news to anyone who saw her first two shows (think emphatic party-comedy meets self-empowerment seminar) that Luisa Omielan didn’t see herself as a political animal. That all changed when she had to usher her dying mum through a dysfunctional NHS. Her new show, Politics for Bitches (also in development for BBC3), lays that political education bare and, as you’d expect from this most democratic of comics, invites her audience to join in.A welcome return for Sh!t Theatre’s wonderfully warm 2017 fringe smash. The duo Louise Mothersole and Rebecca Biscuit recount their pilgrimage to Dolly Parton’s Tennessee theme park and their ersion to the same state’s body farm, where human decomposition is studied. En route they unravel unexpected connections between Dolly the singer and Dolly the sheep. A show about cloning, icons and iniduality, it is full of the duo’s love not just for the country star, but for each other.Sitcom regulars Anna Crilly (taciturn housekeeper Magda in Lead Balloon) and Margaret Cabourn-Smith (Miranda’s pregnant pal, Alison) team up as a double act reunited after a decade apart for one last gig. Sexism and ageism are on the agenda in a show by standup turned playwright Danielle Ward.With bobbling bobble hats, tempestuous tents and four pairs of wobbly wellies, this dance show for children aged three to five, staged by the inclusive company Indepen-dance 4, is directed by a hero of children’s theatre, Anna Newell. The autumnal colour design is a delight, as are the dancers who weave between showers of leaves.The BBC and Avalon are presenting four debut dramas at the fringe, written by former Perrier winner Frank Skinner, journalist Bim Adewunmi, Bafta-winning director Beryl Richards and the ever-excellent actor Katherine Parkinson, whose play Sitting finds three people posing for a painting in an artist’s studio years apart from each other.If you can judge a comic by the quality of her collaborators, Kate Berlant’s Edinburgh debut would be a home banker. In the US, the LA native is celebrated for her double act with Search Party star John Early, and also popped up in Reggie Watts’s Netflix special Spatial. But her solo work is just as acclaimed: the New York Times placed her “at the forefront of experimental comedy”.Jamali Maddix had no sooner established himself in live comedy when TV came calling – and the success he had hosting Viceland’s documentary Hate Thy Neighbour, about racial hatred and resurgent rightwingery, propelled him directly into the big league. This year’s fringe dates spearhead a maiden world tour for the Ilford boy, with a new show promising “more personal tales of hate and moral confrontation from his travels around the world”.Once seen, Jessie Cave’s 2015 show I Loved Her was never forgotten. A heartfelt, hyper-neurotic account of the anxieties and obsessions attendant on her life with fellow comic (and father of her child) Alfie Brown, it took oversharing to the nth degree. Now she’s back for the first time since, with another DIY solo show (“confessional comedy meets DIY performance art,” she calls it) about motherhood, Instagram and getting through a breakup.The fringe’s From Start to Finnish season includes circus, drama and a mask-theatre show about Finland’s myth of an elf that lives in the sauna. Meanwhile, the Helsinki-born choreographer Ima Iduozee performs his minimalist, shape-shifting solo This Is the Title, bringing a kind of hypnotic stillness to his B-boy stylings.Most people wouldn’t be able to name the 14 events in a tetra-decathlon, let alone compete in one. But Lauren Hendry cheerily decided to give a world championships a go despite being a self-proclaimed “serious amateur”. Her one-woman show is a 60-minute stroll through what happened, directed by Jenna Watt, who won strong reviews for Faslane in 2016.Pleasance at EICCToddlers can be the toughest theatre critics, but Starcatchers are a safe bet to keep young ones enchanted. The company’s co-production with Curious Seed, for the under-threes, invites the audience on to a nursery-style set for a closeup view of performers who make magic from the simplest of props, as they celebrate the bond between parent and child. The Mash Report host has been the go-to man for sharp political comedy for the last few years, and this year he’s back, albeit with a show billed – for its entire 24-night run – as a work-in-progress. There’s acute political humour elsewhere, too, from Ahir Shah and Ayesha Hazarika on the left, Fin Taylor antagonising everyone in the middle, and Geoff Norcott’s Toryism at the other extreme.Canadian ice-skating troupe Le Patin Libre return with their cool moves in a double bill performed in a rink that takes on epic proportions as they glide around each other, their blades cutting striking designs into the surface. Audiences watch the first part from the stands, then sit down on the ice for the second, where the gang thrillingly skate straight towards you.The Edinburgh film festival has long since shifted from August to the start of summer, but the fringe has a double dose of cult cinema courtesy of horror composer Claudio Simonetti and his band Goblin. They’re playing the intoxicatingly creepy original scores for George Romero’s Dawn of the Dead and Dario Argento’s Suspiria alongside screenings of the films.Shortlised for the Man Booker prize and the  first book award, Chigozie Obioma’s debut novel drew comparisons to both Chinua Achebe and Emile Zola. Gbolahan Obisesan’s adaptation distils the novel to focus on just two of the brothers who encounter a prophet on a fishing trip in Nigeria that spirals into tragedy.Scotland had its Colin “the British are coming!” Welland moment two years ago when an Edinburgh comedy award double-whammy, Richard Gadd and Scott Gibson, threatened a renaissance of Caledonian standup. Leading the pack of homegrown acts this year is cult TV and internet sicko Limmy, presenting the videos he made on the online platform Vine. There is also hotly tipped Christopher Macarthur-Boyd, Jay Lafferty, and a first fringe run in 25 years for Scot Squad and Absolutely star Jack Docherty.As publicity for your Edinburgh fringe run goes, winning Britain’s Got Talent can hardly be bettered. Lee Ridley, AKA Lost Voice Guy, whose cerebral palsy affects his ability to speak, performs a new show expressing scepticism of the “inspiration porn” he identifies in media depictions of disabled people. (Fellow BGT comics Robert White and Daliso Chaponda also play the fringe.)Penelope Skinner is bringing two new plays to Edinburgh this summer. Meek, which explores state control, is at the Traverse in a Headlong production, while Angry Alan is a response to both the men’s rights movement and the rise of Donald Trump. The story follows Roger, whose personal and professional life is imploding when he thinks he finds a saviour in an online activist. Skinner’s partner, Donald Sage Mackay, stars.After eccentric comedies about five-a-side (Jumpers for Goalposts) and indie bands (Broken Biscuits) comes Yorkshire playwright Tom Wells’s one-man musical about synchronised swimming and growing up gay, staged for Hull’s year as UK City of Culture in 2017. In his words, it’s about “having a go at stuff with your mates, and being 15, and wearing armbands”. It should make a splash at this popup in-the-round stage, which can really bring Edinburgh audiences together.With so many of last year’s Edinburgh award nominees not returning to compete (no Sophie Willan, no Mae Martin, no Spencer Jones), attention is bound to focus on 2017 shortlistees Mat Ewins, whose joyful DIY Indiana Jones take-off Adventureman 7 brought such uplift to Fringe 2017, and Jordan Brookes. The new show from the latter deeply destabilising presence addresses events in his personal life triggered by last year’s show.Cabaret star Le Gateau Chocolat has done Shakespeare at the Globe, performed opera at Glyndebourne and addressed his depression in an intimate fringe show, Black. This year he brings his first family show to Edinburgh. His take on The Ugly Duckling draws on his difficulties at school. “Duckie isn’t just about standing up to your bullies,” he says, “it’s about making sure that you don’t become a bully yourself.”Gary McNair has already proven himself a deft observer of both macho bravado and adolescent angst, so don’t miss his new play about a fight at the school gates. His co-writer Kieran Hurley, who had a hit with Beats, creates music-fuelled shows whose soundtracks linger long in the memory. Here, the tracks come from Glasgow group Frightened Rabbit. Elsewhere, McNair’s After the Cuts imagines a future without the NHS.After a scorching premiere in the US in 2016, Jennifer Kidwell and Scott R Sheppard’s razor-sharp and darkly comic take on race relations arrives in the UK. Two Stetson-sporting teachers deliver a lesson at a school where they don’t teach history by reading books. For a course on the American civil war, the pair ide the audience into armies and then all hell breaks loose.The documentary theatre company Lung have staged politically urgent shows exploring the Chilcot inquiry, the 1985 Bradford City fire and the campaign by single mothers in Newham, east London, against their eviction. This year, Matt Woodhead and Helen Monks (who played the teenage Caitlin Moran in Raised By Wolves) present a piece based on the inquiry into a fake plot to Islamise Birmingham schools.Whither the double act? It’s not the format it once was, but there are some fine two-piece comedy acts on the fringe, with women leading the line. Beard (Matilda Wnek and Rosa Robson) and Flo \u0026amp Joan will both be well worth a look, and there is a fringe return for Radio 4 favourites The Pin. Then there are the twisted pleasures of Norris and Parker, whose late-night offering in 2016 was a hoot. Sounds as if their new show Burn the Witch is cut from similarly macabre cloth.Nobody makes shows quite like Nick Mohammed. Performed in character as his bumptious alter ego Mr Swallow, his series of almost-solo spoof musicals (the Dracula one, the Houdini one) have been fringe highlights in recent years. In the Houdini one, you got incredible feats of escapology to boot, and the derring-do looks likely to escalate this summer, when Mohammed launches his newest spectacular on an unsuspecting world: Mr Swallow and the Vanishing Elephant.Katherina Radeva designed the 2017 Edinburgh hit Salt, in which Selina Thompson retraced the transatlantic slave triangle. Now, Redeva – who was born in communist Bulgaria – performs her one-woman show about the end of the cold war and reflects on borders past, present and future.A few years ago, they looked like the saviours of the sketch show, but Sheeps have been only an intermittent presence since. Instead, their component talents broke into TV comedy (Liam Williams’ Pls Like Al Roberts in Channel 4’s new Stath Lets Flats), producing (Williams co-runs Fight in the Dog) and theatre (Williams’ and Daran Johnson’s Ricky Whittington and his Cat). It is all the more mouthwatering then that the threesome return at this year’s fringe, with more skilful, smart and silly team comedy.Pins and Needles had a West End run with Mr Popper’s Penguins, a charming slice of Americana about a wannabe Antarctic adventurer whose home life is flipped upside down when a penguin arrives in the post. The company brings another puppet-powered, tuneful treat about an unexpected houseguest, this time based on Raymond Briggs’s book The Bear, which should be lunchtime fun.Apphia Campbell’s monologue, told with gospel and blues songs, was an awardwinner in Edinburgh in 2017 and returns for a limited run. It fuses the lives of two women: a student who fights for civil rights in the wake of Ferguson and Assata Shakur, a member of the Black Liberation Army in the 70s, who became one of the FBI’s most wanted.Cora Bissett had played only a handful of gigs with her indie band Darlingheart when, straight out of school, they landed a major record deal and found themselves on the road with Blur and Radiohead. She looks back at a three-year whirlwind of music, prompted by rereading her teenage diaries, and reflects on the future she wants for her daughter.There was once a fine (if not exactly distinguished) tradition of men playing women for comic effect. The tables have turned now, and – after Zoe Coombs Marr’s success as her sexist alter ego Dave – here comes 2017 best newcomer Natalie Palamides in character as Nate. “For the first time in history,” runs her blurb, “it’s hard to be a man” – an argument she’ll test probably to destruction in this clowning follow-up to last year’s surpassingly strange and delightful debut, Laid. Now, as then, she is directed by cult fringe favourite Dr Brown.Edinburgh resident and former Perrier award champ – back in the days when it was practically the plaything of budding Irish male standups – Dylan Moran now launches his new show Dr Cosmos at the fringe. Finally growing into the elder statesman role he’s long been fashioning for himself, Moran’s oddly wise and always off-beam commentaries on modern living will surely be one of the treats of the festival.Underbelly’s Circus Hub on the MeadowsSome of Mozart’s best known movements do just that in this new family show from the Australian company Circa, whose acrobats perform to the great composer’s music. A pair of circus performers are joined by a musician for a piece that – judging by their frequent past appearances at the festival – should hit the high notes.Disability-led performance company Birds of Paradise explore the issue of actors “cripping up” with an irreverent escapade about an am-dram society who decide to stage a musical inspired by the Daniel Day-Lewis film. Co-presented with the National Theatre of Scotland, it stars Dawn Sievewright, one of the triumphant “ladies of perpetual succour” from Vicky Featherstone’s 2015 fringe sensation.First staged before a date had been set for Ireland’s abortion referendum, Liz Roche Company’s politically urgent dance work about Irish women’s struggle for autonomy of their bodies arrives on the heels of the landslide vote to repeal the eighth amendment. It’s performed by two dancers against an abstract film and a specially commissioned poem by Elaine Feeney.His 2015 show Lance, about leaving home, losing faith and cycling, was a delight its follow-up Maestro, about classical music, was likewise Edinburgh award-nominated. After a year’s break – and now with a sitcom role in Two Doors Down under his belt – Kieran Hodgson returns with ’75, a comic storytelling solo about the first UK-in-Europe referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0b30fc89f868ab520cbc61087d6a9e338efe2/0_361_5636_3381/master/5636.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f6e3fd602368b37417b3fe1773d665","title":"readers travel photography competition june the winners","story":"Moments of calm from Bruges to West Bengal are a theme in this month’s selection, chosen by Mick Ryan of fotoVUE.

Recorded in front of a live audience, Dope Queens isn’t a low-key affair, and all the better for it. Interview-based offshoot Sooo Many White Guys - produced by Broad City’s Ilana Glazer - is equally engaging. HJDIf you like this try Another Round, Late Night WheneverBuxton’s open-ended “ramble chats” are a delight, with Bob Mortimer, Aisling Bea and even Wes Anderson among those bouncing off his observational genius. There are moments when it gets hysterical, and one of the finest involves Louis Theroux breaking out a falsetto version of Yes Sir, I Can Boogie that goes on just long enough to make it eye-wateringly funny. HVIf you like this try Richard Herring’s Leicester Square Theatre PodcastIf true crime is the food of podcasts, comedians Rachel Fairburn and Kiri Pritchard-McLean are your mild-mannered chefs cracking jokes as they work. They claim they’re not mocking serial killers they’re simply obsessed with them. Discussing how Ted Bundy only needs one name “like Britney or Madonna” suggests otherwise, and the pair’s understated humour means they just about get away with the grim jokes. HVIf you like this try A Very Fatal Murder If you’re more concerned with the state of Steve McClaren’s hair than Soccer AM, this is the football podcast for you.

But Austria, France, Germany and Italy made clear they had no immediate plans to open secure centres on their soil.Asked if Austria would open a centre, the prime minister, Sebastian Kurz, said: “Of course not … we are not a first-arrival country, unless people jump with parachutes.”Nonetheless, Merkel said the overall agreement was more than she had envisaged before the summit and said she believed it surpassed demands laid down by her coalition partners. Her hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer, had threatened to close Germany’s borders to migrants, sparking a dispute that some feared would bring down Merkel’s government.Merkel was due to brief Seehofer’s CSU party on Friday night about the EU deal, as well as about bilateral agreements she had struck with Spain and Greece, which will require the Mediterranean countries to take back asylum seekers who had arrived in their country first before moving on to Germany.Under EU asylum rules, first-arrival countries are responsible for processing asylum claims, putting a disproportionate burden on southern states nearest north Africa and Turkey.Italy wants to tear up the first-country principle, but the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he did not want to change the rule, setting the stage for more confrontation over the overhaul of EU asylum rules, a process that has stalled after two years of talks.Central European countries claimed they had buried the idea of mandatory refugee quotas for all EU countries. “Now everyone has dropped the topic,” said the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, hailing that as a “a big success”.Donald Tusk, the European council president, told reporters in Brussels that it was “far too early to talk about a success”.Diplomats were left uneasy about the negotiating method of Italy’s new prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, who pushed the summit to the brink of collapse by threatening to veto the entire summit communique, including unrelated parts on trade.When Conte, according to a source, told his fellow leaders: “I am a law professor,” the Bulgarian prime minister, Boyko Borissov, replied: “Well, I used to be a fireman and this is not how you negotiate.” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Löfven, added that he used to be a welder and he did not agree with the Italian’s way of making his point, either.Borissov described the Italian threat as “unpleasant” but conceded that leaders had at best reached a “fragile consensus that does not solve the whole problem”.Several EU leaders stressed they wanted to work with international agencies who were willing to set up migrant camps in north Africa to process asylum claims.However, a paper released by the UN agency for refugees and the International Organisation for Migration on Friday strikes a different tone. They called for “strong leadership from European Union member states on upholding the right to asylum and the rights of migrants”, while stressing that the EU could not outsource the problem. The agencies say they oppose closed detention centres."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa457611bd0a689a15cb69db4c36a3d8c4559d8/0_150_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a9ee8d57d5878cce6ed2f5ac9b1cfd4","title":"amlo mexico election president how despair fueled campaign","story":"Violence, corruption and poverty explain why leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador is the frontrunner in electionIt’s a searing afternoon in Ecatepec, one of Mexico’s most violent and deprived cities, and thousands of followers have gathered under a vast white tarpaulin to hear their pathfinder rage against the machine.For the next hour Andrés Manuel López Obrador – or Amlo to his fans – will deliver a unyielding assault on the scoundrels, mafiosos and influence peddlers he claims have plundered Latin America’s second largest economy and plunged it into a cauldron of thievery, bloodshed and want. “This official banditry is going to end!” the 64-year-old leftist will rail. “Zero corruption and zero impunity!”First, though, he must brush his hair. After pushing through a crush of adorers, López Obrador pauses at the foot of a scaffolding stage, plucks a chesnut-coloured comb from his pocket and calmly runs it through his silver mane. Then the Amlo show begins. “Viva México! Viva México! Viva México!” he shouts from the rostrum, thrusting both arms into the air. “It feels like a dream – but we are just a few days away from achieving the transformation of Mexico!”That transformation is almost certain to begin on Sunday when 88 million Mexicans head to the polls to pick their new president. Amlo, who is making his third run for the presidency, has towered above his rivals in the polls for months. “We’re 30 points ahead!” he boasted to the sea of supporters before him in Ecatepec, who responded with cries of: “Presidente! Presidente!”Experts say three interlinked crises – security, corruption and poverty – explain why López Obrador now stands on the cusp of the Mexican presidency, and nowhere are they more visible than in Ecatepec, a gritty, neglected conurbation that is just 30km (18 miles) from Mexico City’s chic central districts but feels like another world. Ecatepec is Mexico’s most populous municipality and one of its most impoverised, with nearly 790,000 of its 1.8 million inhabitants living in poverty. It is also one of the most dangerous regions in an increasingly dangerous country where at least 200,000 people have been killed since a catastrophic “war on drugs” was launched just over a decade ago.“Environmental degradation, femicide, insecurity, car theft, extortion, kidnapping, the disappearance of women … Ecatepec is a microcosm that illustrates all of the country’s most serious problems,” said Azucena Cisneros, a local politician from Amlo’s party, Morena. “It’s an urban tragedy.”Amlo has built his campaign around pledges to eradicate corruption and rule for the poor. Among the devotees at his Ecatepec rally, many described him as the only man capable of saving them from a crime wave they blamed on venal politicians. A cry for help had been painted on to one banner next to the stage: “We are the most violent municipality! We have been robbed and ignored by these corrupt politicians! We deserve to live better lives! We are good people! That’s why Ecatepec is with you, Andrés Manuel!” “It’s so terribly insecure,” complained Gaby Mejía, a 46-year-old primary school teacher. “My students are always coming up to me and saying: ‘Miss, did you hear about the shootout near my house? That they killed you-know-who?’” Mejía’s mother, Josefina, 74, nodded in agreement, recalling how she had recently been held up by group of armed car thieves. “We’re already in the abyss,” she said, describing Amlo as Mexico’s salvation: “He’s one of those men who is only born every 100 years.”Many describe Amlo’s rise as the result of a furious popular revolt against the two parties that have ruled Mexico since the end of one-party rule in 2000 – the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) and the National Action party (Pan) – and which are widely blamed for the current crises. “It’s a social-civic insurrection. It’s a collective awakening,” said Germán Rufino Contreras, a former federal deputy and Amlo supporter in Ecatepec. But Viridiana Ríos, an Ecatepec-born member of Democracia Deliberada, a collective of young leftist Mexican thinkers, said she believed despair better explained why voters were embracing Amlo and change. “I think it is just that a lot of people haven’t noticed we have created a country where a lot of people have nothing to lose.”Two days after Amlo’s triumphant rally, Cisneros and a group of Morena activists embarked on a pre-election march through some of Ecatepec’s most marginalized corners, places where many have shockingly little to lose. In Vivienda del Taxista, a rickety shanty built on a rubbish-strewn wasteland, she visited the home of Marisol Gutiérrez, a Morena campaigner and seamstress who supports her daughter and two grandchildren on an income of about 600 pesos (£22) a week. “It’s not enough. But … the truth is, there’s no work,” Gutiérrez said, showing off her family’s battered stone-and-asbestos abode which had a bullet hole in its roof and had been built directly under a transmission line.On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres.Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country.The US has donated at least $1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least $54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level.But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces.As the cartels have fractured and ersified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence.\u0026nbspImproved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated.The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel.While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence.Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations.\u0026nbspOn one moldy wall hung a photograph of Gutiérrez’s son, Geovanni, who killed himself in 2016 aged 20. On another, a portrait of Jesus carried the phrase: “The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want.”In the hovel nextdoor Enrique Hernández, a semi-retired rickshaw driver from Oaxaca state, said he also planned to vote Amlo: “More than anything because we all have the right to an opportunity in life.”Cisneros’s next stop was La Cuesta, a tumbledown slum cobbled together from cardboard, wooden crates and repurposed advertising hoardings above a natural gas pipeline. “It’s a time bomb,” said Arnulfo Reyes Lara, a social worker who fights to keep the community’s kids off drugs and off the streets.At every turn, Cisneros was bombarded with tales of deprivation and crime.Odilia Allende, 55, told of how her son had been murdered just a few streets away. “They shot him in the head … These are people with a future, with a reason to live and it’s not fair that the druggies just take their lives when they are on their way to work.”Juan Juárez, a 51-year-old mecanic, described how criminals had beaten his brother to within an inch of his life: “They had to put a titanium plate in his face,” he said, adding: “These days when we go out we feel fear. We need change.”Finally, a sobbing mother approached Cisneros to recount how her daughter had been abducted and raped before she somehow managed to escape alive. “How long ago?” Cisneros asked. “Five days,” the woman replied, breaking down into tears. “It hurts. It still hurts. I try to be strong. I know we have to go on.” “You will get through it,” Cisneros replied, and hugged her. After each heartbreaking petition, Cisneros grabbed her loud-hailer and marched on through the community, imploring locals to vote for change. “Es urgente un cambio en este país!” she shouted. “This country urgently needs change!”Additional reporting by Hernán Sarquis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9970ea3b16615bbe20f98ad802a7eb8e0deb0b0a/0_140_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7b547710b89a2a8eafac66bb1624eb9","title":"indias huge solar ambitions could push coal further into shade","story":"Foreshadowed 100 gigawatt tender is off the scale of country’s energy needs but represents ‘brilliant statement of intent’, analysts sayIndia says it intends to launch a tender for 100 gigawatts of solar power, 10 times the size of the current largest solar tender in the world – another Indian project scheduled to open for bids next month.But analysts have said the country has neither the infrastructure nor the energy demand to warrant installing so much solar capacity in one go, saying the announcement reflects the scale of India’s ambition to become a renewable energy leader.It is one of several green power promises made by Delhi this month on the back of continually falling renewables prices, with implications for coal projects including the proposed Adani Group mine in Queensland, Australia.One lakh refers to 100,000 in the south Asian numbering system, equivalent to 100GW.His office confirmed the plan to the  but declined to provide further details other than that the tender would be launched “in the near future”.The unscheduled announcement surprised some energy policy specialists who said it was unrealistic and unnecessary. “I don’t think a 100GW tender makes a lot of sense,” said Tim Buckley, a director at the pro-renewables Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, but adding he thought the plan was a “brilliant statement of intent”.Delhi announced this month it was raising its target for the amount of renewable energy capacity it plans to install by 2022 to more than 227GW. The previous target, already considered ambitious, was 175GW. About 70GW have been installed so far and another 40 are under construction or being put out to tender, according to government data from June.Buckley said on current trends India was unlikely to reach the 227GW target, but said it was setting an aspirational goal to attract investment and develop the local industry. “The idea is, aim for the moon and you’ll hit the top of the tree,” he said.There are constraints on how fast additional capacity can be added, not least the fact that India simply does not need much more power.More than 200 million Indians still live without regular access to electricity. But Indians are among the lowest per capita users of electricity in the world, especially those being newly connected to the grid.He chalked up the government’s big energy promises to national polls looming next year. “The election is coming up in 2019 and they are facing various economic and industrial challenges,” he said. “I think it’s more a part of putting a very positive spin on messages.”At the beginning of the decade, India had planned to power its growth almost entirely using thermal coal, with about 600GW of coal power plant projects in the pipeline in 2010. Its plan spelled disaster for global efforts to keep warming below the two-degree target set by the Paris climate accords.But as the price of renewables has crashed, and the impact of fossil fuels on Indian air and water has become clearer, the country has sought to reinvent itself as a green energy leader.“We have missed the first and second industrial revolutions,” Singh said at an event in Delhi on Friday. “We caught up with the digital revolution, but we need to lead this revolution towards clean energy and renewable energy.”Singh said on Friday coal would remain a part of India’s energy mix because it was “a backbone” to the intermittent power provided by renewables.But researchers say the proportion of energy the country derives from coal will keep falling – and that diminishing demand can easily be met by Indian mines, raising questions about the need for new projects such as the proposed Carmichael mine in the Galilee Basin of Queensland, Australia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/545bd60eb02593f0d0babab0cc3deaa84c2b7c87/0_412_7259_4356/master/7259.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3999af39e26006b4ee4252ecc1f08663","title":"mongolias shamanic rituals in pictures","story":"Banned for 70 years under communist rule, the ancient practice of shamanism has been protected by Mongolia’s constitution since 1992"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548680.1530298586!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin hose pipe ban could be extended nationwide","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe watering of gardens attached to hotels or other businesses is banned, but garden centres and “visitor” gardens, such at the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, are exempt from the ban. Photograph: Getty ImagesBans on watering gardens, washing cars and filling pools from public water supplies could be faced by communities across the country to avoid nationwide droughts, Irish Water has said.The month-long hose pipe ban which comes into force in Dublin on Monday may have to be extended to other areas whose water supplies are at risk, the utility said.More than 100 water schemes around the country have been deemed “at risk” by Irish Water, and all will now be assessed for a possible hose pipe ban.Customers in Kilkenny, Longford, Athlone, north Galway, Louth and Kerry have already experienced restricted water supply and outages in some cases. Areas in Cork, Wicklow, Limerick, Kilkenny, Carlow, Tipperary, Clare, Mayo, Sligo, Donegal, Galway, Roscommon, Laois, Limerick, Kerry, Waterford and Offaly have been identified as being at risk.Irish Water has mobilised tankers across the country to fill reservoirs that are most at risk to protect water supplies and ensure customers have access to water. The utility said it was closely monitoring the water supply situation on the Aran Islands, and was ready to ship water to the islands in the coming weeks if necessary. “We are in touch with the farming organisations and offering assistance where water shortage is leading to animal welfare concerns. In critical situations we will accommodate farmers who need to collect water by tanker where it can be made available to meet urgent needs.”The measures in the capital will only apply to domestic water use, with businesses largely escaping the ban.“Irish Water is mindful of the impact that a water conservation order might have on businesses and the tourist industry, and for that reason the prohibition is mainly limited to domestic users with the exception of gardens,” said Irish Water’s corporate affairs manager Kate Gannon.The watering of gardens attached to hotels or other businesses is banned, but garden centres and “visitor” gardens, such at the National Botanic Gardens in Glasnevin, are exempt from the ban.Water source levels, especially the main raw water storage facility at Pollaphuca, are dropping at similar rates to previous droughts in 1975, 1976, and 1995. Irish Water can produce 610 million litres of water per day to serve the Dublin area. Last summer an average of 565 million litres of water per day was used. This summer the average has risen to 585 million litres, but by last Monday the levels were at 609 million litres. On Tuesday demand fell to 603 million litres, but the following day shot up to 615 million litres, exceeding the production capacity by 5 million litres. On Thursday usage fell back to 607 million litres, but the recovery was not sufficient to avoid implementing the hose pipe ban, Irish Water said.A similar ban came into force across Northern Ireland on Friday evening for an indefinite period, with its water use running at 25 per cent above normal levels.The Northern Ireland ban covers similar activities to those in the South, but also extends to cleaning windows, walls, paths and patios using a hose."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3543076.1529934908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"michael viney the beauty of weeping beeches","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWeeping beech: We found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. Illustration: Michael Viney The summer storm swept past in a hectic swirl of branches and I looked out at dawn to a polytunnel plastered with torn, wet leaves. But even on this bare hillside, so open to sea winds, our motley spinney stood firm. I am awed again by its billowing growth, nourished on extra breaths of CO2.The deeper greening of the planet, confirmed by scientific satellite, has encouraged much online enthusiasm. Even one large tree, I read, “strategically placed in a yard, can replace 10 room-size air conditioners operating 20 hours per day”.That would fit the beech beyond our window, now with an extra metre to its arching twigs and dwarfing everything around it in a great, green crinoline of leaves. But as a specimen of Fagus sylvatica, it may have a problem of identity.A tree can take a few years to show you the shape it means to be. Almost 30 years ago, wandering through the old demesne forest at Cong, we found a drift of self-sown beech seedlings, a few inches high, and pocketed one for the garden. A slow ascension in a sheltered corner brought its head up into the wind, green as a lettuce in May, fiery in the winter sun.Ten years later, at about 2.5m tall, its new growth surprised me. Instead of reaching for the sky, its slender twigs arched gracefully earthwards, a first hint that, rather than the common European beech, we might have adopted Fagus sylvatica pendula. Or are the branches just waiting to be hoisted aloft as the trunk piles on height and muscle?The weeping beech is the largest growing of all hardy weeping trees, reaching 25m or so (not on this hillside, it won’t). That’s long after a weeping willow has grown up and decayed.At Florencecourt, Co Fermanagh, there are “immense, round-topped specimens” of the weeping beech, along with the original wild yew, fastigiate freak from the nearby Cuilcagh mountainside and cloned for the sombre, columnar yews of churchyards.Half a dozen other Irish demesnes in the midlands count weeping beeches among their prized trees, and the named cultivars of beeches on old Irish estates run into some 25 variations of form, purple-leaved, columnar or absolutely twisted (“Tortuosa”).Moreover, England’s Kew Gardens have a remarkable walking beech, which is advancing outwards because its branches have rooted down and become a ring of young trees where they struck the ground.Our tree lacks the authentic, perpendicular droop and seems unlikely to start walking anywhere. It may be just feeling down at its singularity and windy exposure than actually wanting to weep (“even to a casual observer,” writes botanist Charles Nelson, “several different habits are obvious”). The arch of its branches does, at least, still admit me to its shade to offer the trunk a hug.Beech was typically a “big house” tree, but happily accepted by the surrounding populace as occasional “pin trees”, studded with pins and nails (later with hammered coins) in pagan, tree-worshipping rituals. But it never became a native.“Some modern ecologists,” Thomas Pakenham has noted, “advocate a kind of ethnic cleansing in which naturalised species, such as beech, are systematically hunted down and destroyed.”He might have been referring to some of those devoted to restoring and extending Ireland’s native woodlands, many in the remnants of ascendancy estates.In Management Guidelines for Ireland’s Native Woodlands, published last year by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service, the beech is joining sycamore, lodgepole pine and rhododendron as an “invasive alien”.Authors John Cross and Kevin Collins point to its dense, dark shade and prolific seedling-scatter as a threat to the ground layer of woodland plants and the regeneration of native trees. Their advice is to “pluck out” beech seedlings in winter months, their identity marked by the obstinate, golden curl of their leaves.A national survey of native woodlands found beech in 69 per cent of them. But the guidelines are far from absolute in wanting them gone, if “mother trees” among them are doing no great harm. Indeed, their shade can help foster the growth of yews. And mature, even venerable, beeches have a value to the natural world quite independent of their beauty.At Clonbur Woods, for example, on the limestone shore of Lough Mask on the MayoGalway border, a restoration by Coillte has left some stands of beeches intact. Planted originally as part of the Guinness estate, part of their role in bioersity is to offer a home for the birds-nest orchid, Neotinia nidus-avis.It is a somewhat charmless waif among orchids, and its flowers are a pallid, yellowish-brown, and nectarless. Its leafless and parasitic growth depends on digesting a fungus that is part of the network of underground mycorrhizae that helps to feed the beech’s roots. The plant is also rare, protected and declining, with no duty to be beautiful."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548712.1530347644!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"temperatures to dip but once in a blue moon heatwave to go on","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            A man sleeps in the shade in the Phoenix Park in  Dublin.

Photograph Nick BradshawThe .Ireland’s heatwave appears to have passed its peak but temperatures are still expected to rise to between 25 and 28 degrees in most places on Saturday. There is a chance of showers in the west and northwest later on Saturday and isolated showers on Sunday but the forecaster said “otherwise there’ll be no break in the drought conditions” as the State’s heatwave continues. Met Éireann’s definition of a heatwave is five consecutive days of maximum temperatures of 25 degrees and over for a given location.Temperatures in Leinster and Munster are expected to hit highs of 25 to 28 degrees on Sunday but cloud will increase through Ulster and Connacht where vaules are seen rising to between 18 to 24 degrees.The month-long ban applies to watering gardens, washing cars and filling pools from public water supplies and those found flouting the rules face fines of €125. The ban may be extended to other parts of the country with the utility firm monitoring some 100 at risk water schemes nationwide. The highest temperature on Friday, 31.1 degrees, was recorded at Shannon at 4pm, around a degree below where thermometers there peaked on Thursday. Met Éireann said four other stations - Mount Dillon, Co Roscommon Claremorris, Co Mayo Athenry, Co Galway and Moore Park, Co Cork - all recorded temperatures of at least 30 degrees.Met Éireann’s John Eagleton said the recent weather was similar to a period in 1976 when a streak of warm and sunny weather continued from Easter until the end of August, with temperatures peaking at the end of June. Asked if a repeat of that lengthy summer was on the cards, Mr Eagleton said: “Nobody knows” but that Friday was “the last day of the really mad temperatures” for now. One small corner of Ireland, however, managed to find a cloud. Malin Head in Co Donegal found itself under sea fog and temperatures had not risen above 12 degrees by mid-afternoon. For the rest of the country, a slight dip from the heat of recent days could be welcome. “It’s been an exceptional heatwave that comes to Ireland once in a blue moon, a generational heat wave,” said Mr Eagleton. “Let’s hope it is.”Despite the weather and the public’s enjoyment of it, emergency services have not reported any serious recent incidents. The Coastguard said it had only had to deal with routine incidents on Friday, including offshore pollution reports and coming to the aid of broken down pleasure boats and jet-skis.Next week, Met Éireann said it would remain warm or very warm but with a greater risk of scattered or isolated showers and some cloudier periods. Top temperatures on Monday are expected to reach 24 to 27 degrees.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillA number of serious allegations against former Garda commisssioner Nóirín O’Sullivan and others have been strongly challenged by the evidence heard over the past year at the Charleton tribunal, which yesterday finished its public sittings.In his report, which is expected in October, the tribunal chairman, Mr Justice Peter Charleton, will rule on the evidence that has been heard as to whether the then Garda commissioner Martin Callinan grievously smeared Sgt Maurice McCabe during conversations with others in December 2013 and January 2014, including, according to deputy John McGuinness, describing him as a “kiddie fiddler”.There is no doubting that the evidence in regard to this part of the tribunal’s inquiry is very serious and involves a number of parties independently making claims against Callinan that he spoke negatively to them about McCabe, claims that Callinan denies.If in time Mr Justice Charleton decides that the then chief of police had told the then head of the Public Accounts Committee that Sgt McCabe was a child abuser, it will be a grave finding.However, it would be a pity if the controversy that such a finding would provoke, if it happens, would distract attention entirely from another aspect of the tribunal’s proceedings.Even prior to the judge’s report it is possible to point to significant episodes in the controversy where damaging public claims were made on the basis of reasons the tribunal evidence has now shown to be questionable. In many cases the claims were used at the time to call for the resignation of Callinan’s successor, Nóirín O’Sullivan, even though she had denied the claims.Eventually, due to these and other criticisms, she did indeed step down.Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin spoke in the Dáil on Wednesday, February 8th, 2017, as the Oireachtas was considering establishing a commission of inquiry into the McCabe affair.“This morning a journalist contacted me and told me they had direct knowledge of calls made by the Garda commissioner to journalists during 2013 and 2014 in the course of which the commissioner made very serious allegations of sexual crimes being committed by Sgt Maurice McCabe,” he said.The commissioner being referred to was O’Sullivan, and Howlin was of the view that she should “step aside” pending the outcome of the commission.Howlin’s comment, we now know, was based on a telephone conversation he had that morning with Alison O’Reilly, of the Irish Daily Mail, who had told him of what she said she had been told by a colleague, Debbie McCann, of the Irish Mail on Sunday.However, McCann has now told the tribunal that she never said to O’Reilly what O’Reilly claims she said. There is a complete conflict between the two.Furthermore, McCann has said it was not the case that she ever discussed McCabe with O’Sullivan, whether in negative terms or otherwise. O’Sullivan has said the same. Phone records examined by the tribunal show no contacts between the two during the period at issue.O’Reilly said she was told by McCann that O’Sullivan was her source for information about a child sex abuse allegation made against McCabe in 2006 that was comprehensively dismissed by the Director of Public Prosecutions. (This is being called the Ms D allegation.)Howlin made his comments in the Dáil without having checked the veracity of what he was saying with either McCann or O’Sullivan.His claim was the first the public ever heard of McCabe being linked to alleged sex abuse. In his short comment, Howlin referred to sexual crimes, plural, and journalists, plural. His intervention was hugely damaging to O’Sullivan and was reported extensively in the media.The tribunal was given its terms of reference by the Oireachtas. Term of reference K requires the tribunal to “investigate whether commissioner O’Sullivan, using briefing material prepared by Garda Headquarters, influenced or attempted to influence broadcasts on RTÉ on the 9th of May 2016, purporting to be a leaked account of the unpublished O’Higgins Commission Report, in which Sergeant McCabe was branded a liar and irresponsible.”This term of reference could be seen as the equivalent of a charge not only against O’Sullivan but also against the RTÉ crime correspondent, Paul Reynolds, who produced the broadcasts. He, and the colleagues who worked with him in producing the broadcasts, felt they were being accused of being Garda stooges or bad journalists.The provenance of the term of reference has been outlined at the tribunal.In a protected disclosure (a supposedly highly-confidential disclosure made under the “whistleblower” law) in October 2016, McCabe said he was on stress-related leave and that the reports by Reynolds were part of the reason for this.Citing three numbered reasons for his being out of work, McCabe said the first was O’Sullivan’s “treatment of me”.Another was the production of “false evidence” in an attempt to “set me up” at the confidential hearings of the O’Higgins commission (see more on this below).The third was the “disgraceful series of broadcasts” on RTÉ on May 9th, 2016, in which he had been “branded as a liar and irresponsible”.The disclosure then continued: “I am now satisfied, on impeccable authority, that those RTÉ broadcasts were planned and orchestrated by the commissioner, Nóirín O’Sullivan, personally using briefing material prepared at Garda Headquarters.”The Oireachtas opted to reflect McCabe’s claim in the tribunal’s terms of reference, even though O’Sullivan had rejected the claim as untrue.McCabe, when asked at the tribunal to identify the reason for the claim, cited one sentence he claims was said to him by the civilian head of human resources at Garda Headquarters, John Barrett, during a visit by Barrett to McCabe’s home some weeks after the RTÉ reports.Block one is a reference the commissioner’s office in Garda Headquarters. The reference to it is the basis for the serious charge against O’Sullivan and Reynolds.However, Barrett, in his evidence, has said he never made the comment to McCabe that McCabe claims he made.The broadcasts by Reynolds led the news on RTÉ all day, on both radio and television. That they are based on the contents of the then-unpublished O’Higgins commission report can now be shown as the report has been published.In them, Reynolds tells viewers and listeners what is in the report, which he had a copy of and no-one at the tribunal has suggested otherwise. If McCabe did not like the broadcasts, then his issue was with Mr Justice Kevin O’Higgins, Reynolds told the tribunal.The word “lie” is used in the broadcasts, but it does not appear in O’Higgins. However the report does state that McCabe told an “untruth” to a Garda inquiry knowing it to be untrue. There is no mention of McCabe being “irresponsible” in the broadcasts. The use of the word “lie” was discussed within RTÉ. The broadcasts included the fact that the word used in the report was “untruth”.Reynolds, when asked by the tribunal chairman, said he was resentful and angry about the charge made against him. The former chief news editor at RTÉ, Ray Burke, who worked for days with Reynolds on the broadcasts, said the criticisms of their work was an insult to him and his colleagues.The O’Higgins commission sat in private. In its report it found that while McCabe had made valid complaints about policing matters, serious allegations he had made against a number of senior officers were unfounded. An allegation of corruption made against Callinan did not have a “scintilla of evidence” to support it, the report found. While the commission said McCabe had been truthful, it also noted that he was prone to exaggeration.A few days after the O’Higgins commission report was published on May 11th, 2016, which the government had hoped would bring the McCabe saga to an end, there were reports on RTÉ’s Prime Time, and by Mick Clifford in the Irish Examiner, that were based on partial leaks of confidential information from the commission’s proceedings. These reports had the effect of reigniting the McCabe affair and, once again, putting pressure on O’Sullivan.One aspect of the reports was that a serious claim against McCabe was to have been made by O’Sullivan’s legal team at the private commission hearings. “That was blown out of the water when McCabe produced a transcript” of a secret recording he had made which disproved the claim, said the Examiner report.The recording referred to was one made secretly by McCabe of a meeting with a Garda colleague. The recording showed that the claim made against McCabe in a summary document produced by the legal team acting for O’Sullivan and other senior officers at the commission hearings was incorrect. The summary document was designed to justify the O’Sullivan legal team’s desire to attack McCabe’s motivation at the commission hearings.However, the evidence heard by the tribunal shows that another document handed in by the same legal team, at the same time or soon thereafter, disclosed that the claim against McCabe contained in the summary was incorrect. This document, a report of the meeting secretly taped by McCabe, gave a version of events that agreed with McCabe’s transcript. In other words, it also showed that the claim made in the summary was incorrect. In the witness box, McCabe was asked if he accepted this. He said at first that he did, and then immediately changed his answer.“I’ll just tell you, and I have, you know, admitted a few things here, but I have to say, and it is in my heart, that I think if I hadn’t got the recording of the Mullingar meeting, I think it would have been serious for me.”The tribunal was told that the incorrect or mistaken claim arose following a consultation between lawyers and a Garda officer. In other words, someone misdescribed or misunderstood what was being said during a series of consultations that took place over a weekend in order to have the summary document ready for the Monday morning. There is no evidence that connects O’Sullivan directly in any way with what happened over the weekend. The legal team was acting for her but also for other officers. The legal team met these officers, but not O’Sullivan. The tribunal will in time report on the matter.Prime Time and the Irish Examiner did not name the two gardaí. However, during his comments under Dáil privilege in 2016, Wallace named the two gardaí he said were “planning to perjure themselves” at the O’Higgins commission as Supt Noel Cunningham and Sgt Yvonne Martin.“Sgt Maurice McCabe would be buried by now if he had not taped the conversation,” Wallace said.RTÉ has recently made a six-figure settlement with Cunningham arising out of the Prime Time report. A defamation case against the broadcaster taken by Martin continues. Both are also suing the Irish Examiner, as well as other media organisations. In a statement to the tribunal, Martin said she had never even attended the O’Higgins commission.In September 2016 McCabe met the former head of the Garda press office, Supt Dave Taylor, in Taylor’s home. At the time McCabe was on stress-related sick leave largely due, as he said in his protected disclosure, to his view as to O’Sullivan’s “treatment of me”, her attempt, as he saw it, to “set me up” at the O’Higgins commission hearings, and her role, as he believed it, in Reynolds’s broadcasts based on the commission findings.Taylor was also in a bad way. He had been arrested, was suspended on reduced pay, was in the middle of a severe crisis involving a member of his family, and was the subject of a then ongoing criminal inquiry during which he was asserting his right to silence. Such were the pressures he was under, his wife Michelle has told the tribunal, she feared for his life.Taylor felt that O’Sullivan, who had moved him from the press office to the traffic ision when she took over from Callinan, was the source of all his woes.At the meeting McCabe was told by Taylor that he, Taylor, had been conducting a smear campaign against McCabe while head of the Garda press office, that he had done so on the orders of Callinan, and that O’Sullivan had known about it. McCabe subsequently made a protected disclosure about the matter and so too then did Taylor (who had been told by McCabe that he was making one). Wallace and his colleague Clare Daly TD met both men at around this time.On October 4th, Clifford, in the Examiner, reported that protected disclosures had been made by two (unidentified) members of the force, alleging a smear campaign and saying that O’Sullivan had known about it. The report was published around the same time as the disclosures were being received by the Department of Justice.Speaking at the Charleton tribunal, Conor Dignam SC, for Garda Headquarters, said the editorial in the Irish Examiner that day included the following phrase: “Today’s revelations about an organised campaign driven by senior garda management to undermine a whistleblower”. This put the matter, Dignam said, as something that was being revealed, rather than alleged.It is worth noting that McCabe’s basis for making his claim was what he was told by Taylor, so there was in fact only one source for the serious allegations against O’Sullivan and Callinan, something which was known to Daly, who had met both men.McCabe, Wallace, Clifford and Daly have all said they were told, or it was indicated to them by Taylor, that the alleged smear campaign involved texts. McCabe said he went back the day after he met Taylor to check that he had been told “hundreds” of texts may have been involved. He was, he said, told the number of texts may have been in the thousands.Yet Taylor, in his sworn evidence, has said he never claimed to anyone that the alleged smear campaign involved texts.In his evidence Taylor said he had spoken with 12 named journalists as part of smear campaign. Conor Lally, crime and security editor with The , was one of those named. On Thursday. Taylor’s counsel, Michael O’Higgins SC, said 10 of the journalists had denied Taylor’s claim, and two had asserted journalistic privilege. Lally is one of those who denied Taylor’s claim.Michael O’Higgins acknowledged that no independent evidence had been produced to Charleton to support charges that O’Sullivan had known of the campaign his client said he was ordered by Callinan to conduct. He also acknowledged that Taylor’s credibility was a significant issue. His client’s claims were “capable” of being believed, he said. Whether they should be was a matter for the chairman, he said.The day after Howlin’s comments in the Dáil, a shocking report on Prime Time set in motion a controversy that, before it had ended, led to the acknowledgement by the then taoiseach, Enda Kenny, that he should retire, and the decision of the Oireachtas to establish not merely a commission but a tribunal of inquiry into the McCabe allegations.In the Prime Time report, journalist Katie Hannon outlined how documents from Tusla that had been sourced by McCabe by way of freedom-of-information requests showed that in 2013, following a counselling session with Ms D, a false report was sent to Tusla by the counsellor in which it was recorded that the allegation against McCabe was one of digital rape, rather than the vastly more minor allegation that had in fact been made by Ms D (the allegation that had been made in 2006 and which the DPP had dismissed).This false report from the counsellor, created, the tribunal has been told, as a result of a botched cut-and-paste job from a different client’s file, was in turn then forwarded to the Garda. Tusla as a result opened files on McCabe’s children.A news report based on the Tusla material was published online by Clifford in the Irish Examiner on the same evening as the Prime Time programme.In her report Hannon outlined to the public, for the first time, the fact of the 2006 Ms D allegation and its dismissal by the DPP. She also reported that the false Tusla report, created in 2013 after Ms D had gone to see a counsellor, happened at a time when rumours were beginning to circulate in political and other circles about McCabe.In a statement on Monday, February 13th, McCabe and his wife Lorraine called for a public tribunal.“We have endured eight years of great suffering, private nightmare, public defamation and state vilification arising solely out from the determination of Maurice to ensure that the Garda Síochána adheres to decent and appropriate standards of policing in its dealings with the Irish people.“Our personal lives and our family life, and the lives of our five children, have been systematically attacked in a number of ways by agencies of the Irish state and by people working for the state in those agencies.”The Oireachtas eventually charged the tribunal it established to examine whether the false Tusla file had been used by senior Garda officers to discredit McCabe.As a result, it appears, of separate claims made by another Garda whistleblower, Keith Harrison, the tribunal was also charged with examining whether there was a “pattern” of false Tusla reports being created and their being used by senior gardaí to target whistleblowers.No evidence to support either of these enormously serious suggestions has been produced at the tribunal, though there are continuing concerns expressed by McCabe about how the Garda dealt with the false reports it received in relation to him following the “clerical error” made by the counsellor and the creation of the false file. The tribunal may express a view on this matter in its final report.Mr Justice Charleton has already dismissed Harrison’s claims against Tusla as being “without any validity”.The issue of a pattern of Tusla files being used against Garda whistleblowers was not explored during the tribunal’s sittings and no one has argued at the tribunal that there is any evidence to support such a scenario."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548628.1530299553!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"long hot summer ahead as brexit negotiations drag on","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFrench president Emmanuel Macron greets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar during a breakfast meeting at an EU summit in Brussels, on Friday. Photograph: Virginia MayoPAFor months it was billed as the “Brexit showdown”.The June summit of EU leaders in Brussels was the point at which the UK would have to demonstrate movement on a series of Brexit issues, chief among them the Irish Border.Otherwise, Irish and EU leaders warned, the negotiations would be in trouble. A withdrawal agreement, due to be completed by the autumn, would be in doubt. That meant the transition period sought by the UK – allowing it to ease itself out of the EU after next March, rather than leaving all of a sudden – would become uncertain.Were such a thing to happen it would cause consternation in London, as the UK was brought face-to-face with tumbling out of the EU next March.And yet, the British declined to co-operate. There would be no British proposals on the Border or the future relationship, London made clear, until it was in a position to make them. The UK would not dance to the EU’s tune. It would make its proposals when it was ready to do so. Brexit business continued, but at a snail’s pace.As a group of Irish officials waited for their bags at Brussels airport early on Thursday morning, one senior mandarin who works on Brexit was asked if he was busy these days. “Not really,” was the reply. “I wish I was.”Ireland had wanted to avoid a situation where the Border ended up as one of several issues to be thrashed out at five-to-midnight as deadlines loomed in the autumn. But that’s exactly what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney now face. There’s just no getting away from that.So in recent weeks, the focus of the summit moved to migration into the EU, as a new anti-immigration Italian government found its feet and German chancellor Angela Merkel, still Europe’s most important political leader, came under unprecedented domestic political pressure on the same issue.The switch in focus was evident as the EU leaders arrived for the summit on Thursday, traversing the long red carpet in the Europa building to make their way for a few words with their national media. Few spoke about Brexit. The Irish understand this it’s not clear the British do. Europe is getting over Brexit. They have other things to be getting on with.Going into the summit, one reporter asked the Hungarian prime minister, the authoritarian anti-immigrant Victor Orban, why he persisted in speaking about an “invasion” when there were hardly any migrants coming into Hungary.“Come to the border,” Orban told him.“I went to the border, there is no one there,” the reporter replied.“Because there is a border,” responded Orban.The truth is that Europe’s leaders are having to accommodate themselves to the fact that in many of their countries, there is no support for admitting large numbers of migrants from Africa. They know that if they don’t address the issue, politicians who will address it – one way or another – will be elected. That, more than Brexit, or Trump, or trade, or budgets, is what this summit was about.Meanwhile, the adjacent Justus Lipsius building, where press and officials were gathering, went into temporary lockdown. Access to the building was shut down – nobody in, nobody out. Police clambered down manholes but emerged a few minutes later shrugging and shaking heads.The security alert didn’t keep out the former Ukip leader – and the man who more than anyone else made Brexit a reality – Nigel Farage, who buzzed about from interview to interview in the vast atrium that housed the hundreds of journalists accredited for the summit.For someone who wants to destroy the EU, he seems remarkably addicted to EU summits. The European Parliament, of course, pays his salary.The Irish Border? “It’s the biggest nonsense of all,” he said. “There’s a lot of Euroscepticism in Ireland,” he told Irish reporters. “Always has been, always has been.”And Farage was withering about Varadkar. “The ultimate Yes man in Brussels,” he said. But Farage is a marginal figure these days, even in the UK. His work is done. It’s left to others to pick up the pieces.Two events dominated Thursday night – the EU leaders’ dinner, and the England-Belgium World Cup match. Journalists tried to make the game a metaphor for the summit, or even for the Brexit process, with limited success.More telling perhaps were the photos released from inside the summit room, which showed Belgian prime minister Charles Michel present British prime minister Theresa May with a Belgium jersey.Varadkar donned a Belgium scarf. Everyone was on Belgium’s side. Nobody was cheering for England. British officials later claimed they had a jersey for Michel too, but were ambushed by the Belgians. Nothing seems to be working out as they hoped.When the match starts, the leaders’ dinner is ongoing they won’t be out for many hours yet. The bars around the EU quarter are packed Farage and the Ukip MEPs bray their way to the Place du Luxembourg, but quieten over the evening as England go down to a 1-0 defeat. In the press bar at the summit venue, there is a quiet smattering of applause when the final whistle goes. Perhaps it is because the Belgians are not a passionate nation perhaps everyone realises it will be duller when the English are not around.Before the dinner, there was a brief bilateral meeting involving Varadkar and May. Their personal relations are said to be not good, but officials insist cordiality and business was the order of the day. Varadkar restated his requirements on Brexit May told him proposals are forthcoming. They agreed to resuscitate the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on the North, which the Irish have been seeking for months. Some progress, perhaps, but not on Brexit.At the dinner, meanwhile, things were not going well. The new Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conti, attending his first summit after taking power on a pledge to stop the boats packed with African migrants arriving in Italy, blocks agreement on anything until the leaders agree a package of measures to address the migration crisis.This is not how the summits work, council president Donald Tusk explains to him. This is not the procedure. Conti doesn’t care. He is, after all, in government with the Five Star movement, whose slogan is “Vaffanculo!” (“F**k off”).As the session dragged on into the early hours, exasperation with the Italians grew. Conte told the group he was unimpressed at the way it managed its business. He was speaking, he said, as a former lawyer.The Swede Stefan Lofven piped up. He was speaking as a former welder. The Bulgarian Boyko Borissov said he was a former fireman. He is also a former bodyguard, karate coach and footballer. Though he didn’t mention that.At 4.35am, having hammered out a compromise that was half resolution and half aspiration, bleary-eyed EU leaders shuffled out into the Brussels dawn. Borissov said they should establish a trade union to defend their rights not to work extra-long hours.The leaders were whizzed back to their hotels for a few hours’ sleep before Friday’s session started, albeit a few hours late. The young guns – Varadkar, Sebastian Kurz of Austria, Emmanuel Macron, Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg – bounded in the old guard looked less lively. After the tortuous Thursday eveningFriday morning session, nobody was in any mood for hanging around. They rattled through the agenda, including matters related to Brexit. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed the leaders on “some progress on some areas” – but none on others, including the Irish Border.After 2pm, Tusk and commission president Jean-Claude Juncker hosted the end-of-summit press conference with Borissov, marking the end of the six-month Bulgarian presidency.He milked the moment, droning on and on in Bulgarian about the achievements of the presidency. Tusk looked on impassively Juncker looked like a man who needed a gin and tonic. Finally, it was time for questions. The first questioner took the microphone. “What was the biggest achievement of the Bulgarian presidency?”Varadkar held his own press conference. He tried to sound optimistic about Brexit, but failed. The EU seems set to reject the forthcoming British white paper. He told Mrs May, he said, that there was “no point” in putting forward something that was incompatible with single market rules.“While we really regret the fact that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union,” he said, “we’re not going to let them destroy the European Union.” A long hot summer is in store.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneAlthough always pleasant of demeanour, we thought Simon Harris seemed in particularly good spirits this week.And now we know why. The Minister was Health couldn’t help letting colleagues in on the good news at the parliamentary party’s summer night out on Wednesday.His wife, Caoimhe, is expecting their first child and Simon was bursting to tell. “Don’t say it to anyone, it’s supposed to be a secret,” he told half the parliamentary party.Which is the same thing as hiring a plane to fly your message on a banner over Croke Park on All-Ireland final day, only cheaper.Congratulations to the expectant parents. ETA is early in the new year.The news adds an interesting dimension to the Minister for Health’s role in successfully steering the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment. It’s difficult not to wonder what he must have been thinking during the various debates, public meetings and press events on the abortion question, when he was coming to terms with the welcome but anxious early stages of his personal situation.Perhaps it explains why he was so knowledgeable and understanding of issues relating to early pregnancies and pregnant women.It also means that the “I fancy Simon Harris” posters might have to be retired.The Taoiseach was treated to a showing of one of them when he turned up at The Body and Soul festival in the grounds of Ballinlough Castle in Westmeath last weekend.Leo likes his festivals. At one point he was spotted walking barefoot in the grass, which is the thing to do at this happy hippyish annual celebration of the summer solstice.On Saturday afternoon, he was one of the guests in a special edition of The  Women’s\u0026nbspPodcast, where he talked about the recent abortion referendum, among other things. As Kathy Sheridan introduced him and talked about the part he played in bringing about the result, a young woman wearing a bikini jumped up and waved that familiar sign from the day of the count.“Whoever thought Simon Harris could be a sex symbol?” marvelled his boss.He later retreated with friends to the Absolut tent.It’s all go in Leoland.He may have had an early flight to Brussels on Thursday morning, but the Taoiseach was out socialising the night before at his parliamentary party’s summer barbecue in Dicey’s Garden on Harcourt Street.The place was heaving, not least because it’s a hugely popular spot with Dublin’s young Brazilian community. They were in high spirits as their national team clinched its spot in the World Cup knockout stage with a win over Serbia on the night.So the Fine Gaelers cheered on Brazil, christening the place Leo De Janeiro for the occasion.Party chairman Martin Heydon organised the bash to take advantage of the lovely weather and encourage team bonding. However, the latest episode of delaying tactics from opponents of the Road Traffic Bill meant that TDs had to remain on standby in Leinster House as votes were called on various amendments.A slimmed down Noel Rock told colleagues he jogged from the festivities in Harcourt Street to Kildare Street in record time. The TD for Dublin North-West has shed three stone in his local Flyefit gym in Drumcondra since beginning his new regime of “gymwork and a bit of a diet” in January.Back in Dicey’s, fiscal prudence was the order of the day for chairman Heydon, who put money behind the bar for the troops. He chose a pub where the pints cost €1.50 all night – which is the main reason the Brazilians love the place.(Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party, by the way, is having its summer soiree next week. Clare TD Timmy Dooley is in charge of selecting the venue but hasn’t told anyone where it is yet.)The Taoiseach didn’t hang around for too long at the barbecue, but his Minister for Europe, Helen McEntee, led a large posse of TDs and Senators to the adjacent Copper Face Jacks. McEntee was also on Leo’s early flight to Brussels, looking fresh as a daisy at their press briefing later in the day.Leo did the diplomatic thing at the summit when asked what team he would be supporting in Thursday night’s clash between Belgium and England. He said that as he was in Belgium, he would cheer for the home team. However, he pointed out that if Belgium won, England would “probably get an easier ride in the next round so perhaps it is one of those win-win scenarios”.He wore a Belgian scarf which European commissioner Jean-Claude Juncker (fresh from his Dublin visit last week which he seems to have thoroughly enjoyed) placed around his neck after the country’s prime minister, Charles Michel, handed out some Red Devils merchandise before the meeting.He managed to get the British prime minister to pose with a Belgium football shirt, which had number 10 on the back along with the name of their top attacker, “Hazard”.Theresa May took it well. But, rather like her long-awaited Brexit White Paper, she didn’t produce an England white jersey in return.At the beginning of this week’s Cabinet meeting, just before Ministers got down to business, Paschal Donohoe had a small request to make of one of his colleagues.He turned to Josepha Madigan, the Minister for Culture. “Josepha, will you be hearing confessions today?”But not as much as the comment from the Minister for Justice, who was at the receiving end of compliments from the Taoiseach for his sure-footed handling of a number of recent projects. There was applause from colleagues.But Charlie Flanagan wasn’t getting carried away by all the praise.“Thank you. But I will not rest until Stepaside Garda station is reopened,” was his po-faced reply.Everyone cracked up. Everyone, that is, except for the Minister for Transport, Shane Ross, aka Winston Churchtown. Winston has hitched his reputation to the reopening of the station, and has announced a number of false dawns in this regard.No. He didn’t laugh at all.Two tweets caught our eye this week.The first, courtesy of senior counsel Bernard Dunleavy, provided incontrovertible proof that we are in the middle of a heatwave. He posted a photo of a notice outside the Barristers’ Tea Room Restaurant in the Four Courts headed “Warm Weather Warning”.“During the current Status Yellow hot weather warning, the chairman has agreed that should members wish.... Jackets may be removed here in the Barristers’ Tea Room.”However, lest people fear the chairman of the Bar Council has taken leave of his senses in the heat, it says in small letters at the bottom of the notice: “As per the HSE recommendation.”And the second was fired off on Wednesday by former Fine Gael minister for justice Alan Shatter who is not at all impressed by Ross’s judicial appointments crusade.“Bombast \u0026amp fakery is no substitute for analysis \u0026amp facts. Shane Ross should stop muttering behind my back \u0026amp playing the role of Trump Lite denigrating judges \u0026amp lawyers. I challenge him to directly debate with me his crazy Judicial Apntmnts Bill. Enough of the cowardice! Woof!”Easy there, Alan. Let the dog see the rabbit.So what about it, Winston Churchtown? Are you brave enough to accept Alan’s challenge?What TD entered Leinster House for the first time 37 years after his election?The answer is Paddy Agnew, who was elected to Dáil Éireann as an anti-H-Block candidate in 1981. He never entered the Dáil and held the seat until the following year’s general election. As an IRA prisoner he topped the poll in Louth, elected on the same day as Kieran Doherty, who won a seat in Cavan-Monaghan and died on hunger strike in Long Kesh two months later.Agnew joined Sinn Féin in Dundalk on his release from prison in 1986.He was invited to the Dáil by former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams and given “a special welcome” by leader Mary Lou McDonald, who told the chamber: “This is the first time that he has actually been in Leinster House, so I am sure everybody will extend a warm welcome to him.”After the Sinn Féin TDs burst into applause, Mary Lou looked up to the public gallery where the former TD was sitting with his wife, Catherine. “We are delighted you’re here, Paddy. It took you a while but you got here in the end. Good man.”Later in the proceedings, there was more applause – this time from all sides – when the Ceann Comhairle welcomed him to the Dáil.Afterwards in the Sinn Féin party rooms, Mary Lou presented her honoured guest with the formal framed statement from the returning officer of his election to the Dáil and gave Catherine a framed copy of the issue of An Phoblacht which announced Paddy and Ciarán Doherty’s election as TDs.Line of the week: This is from Michael Collins, member of the Rural Independents Group and TD for Cork South-West. Michael is one of the TDs trying to delay the passage of Shane Ross’s controversial Road Traffic Bill, which will introduce harsher drink-driving penalties and put learners who drive unaccompanied off the road.Here’s Collins, protesting to a very fed-up Leas Cheann Comhairle: “I have not yet had the opportunity to be repetitious.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547199.1530202210!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"angela merkel once dominant figure is exhausted and out of step","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman chancellor Angela Merkel arrives at an European Union summit in Brussels, Belgium on Thursday. Photograph:  Virginia MayoPool via REUTERSIt’s Monday morning in Berlin’s criminal court, a Prussian palace of justice with warrens of corridors, dozens of courtrooms and a 30-metre atrium with staggering, stuccoed staircases sweeping up and down.Europe’s largest court building looks like a real-life optical illusion by the Dutch illustrator Maurits Escher: you can ascend and descend yet feel you’re getting nowhere.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, knows that feeling very well. After a Brussels summit overshadowed by the renewed refugee crisis, she finds out on Sunday afternoon if her political allies will defy her on the refugee question, risk collapsing their coalition and possibly end her political career.The end, if that’s what it is, began three years ago when a wave of migrants entered Germany from the Balkans, Greece and Italy – many fleeing civil war, others economic penury, all looking for a better life.Rather than close Germany’s borders and risk violent battles between police and migrants, Merkel did nothing. The border was left open in September 2015 and, for some migrants, the German leader even set aside the EU’s “Dublin” migration rules.Volunteers turned out in their droves and Germany’s “welcome culture” was born, crowned with Merkel’s upbeat motto: “We can manage this.”So why has the refugee crisis come back to haunt her? Because word spread, via migrant WhatsApp groups, that Germany was open for all. Because Berlin’s neighbours, annoyed at Merkel’s unilateral border decision, now had another good reason to refuse to accept refugees.And because three years on, though new arrival numbers are well down from their 2015 peak, Europe still has no sustainable solution for what Merkel on Thursday called Europe’s “question of fate”: How to deal with the globalisation of refugees and asylum seekers.Instead of European answers, Germany just has national problems that turn up every day in Berlin’s courthouse on the Turmstrasse.On Monday, in courtroom 500: an 18-year-old Russian – a failed asylum seeker and petty thief, yet to be deported – was sentenced to life in prison for attacking and strangling a 60-year-old art historian last year near Zoo Station. His haul: a battered smartphone and €2.Down the corridor, an 18-year-old Syrian refugee was sentenced for flogging a kippa-wearing Israeli in broad daylight on a Berlin street.Meanwhile in courtroom 621, hiding his face on the stand from cameras, a 21-year-old Tunisian asylum seeker went on trial accused of drugging and raping an 18-year-old German student last August. Courts across Germany are hearing similar cases of violent robbery, rape and murder with refugees and asylum-seeker as the accused.Statistically they are not relevant: the vast majority of more than a million people who sought asylum in Germany in recent years are peaceful, grateful people. Crime in Germany has dropped to its lowest level in almost 30 years, according to statistics released this week. But the emotion and perception surrounding crimes committed by refugees has created a toxic mood.As one Merkel official put it this week: “Politics is no longer shaping the mood, mood is shaping politics.”If you read the newspapers, Germany is out of control: an forgivable state of affairs linked closely to a woman who, for the fourth time last April, took an oath as chancellor to “keep the German people from harm”.So why has this blown up into an existential crisis for Angela Merkel, and why now? The answer is the Christian Social Union (CSU), her sister party from Bavaria.For three years the CSU has demanded a tougher refugee line from the Merkel Christian Democratic Union (CDU), but always fallen into line. No more. After a federal election disaster last September, and another state election humiliation looming in October, the Bavarian lion is roaring now with a heady mix of superiority and vulnerability.“Every day people get news reports confirming their view that we politicians don’t have the situation under control,” said Alexander Dobrindt, CSU floor leader in the Bundestag. “Correcting this systemic failure is the task of the CDUCSU union.”Anxious to boost its law-and-order profile, the CSU wants to close German borders from July 1st to migrants already denied asylum here and those already registered for asylum in other European countries.The Bavarians deny they are blackmailing Merkel – or playing chicken with German and European political stability – simply demanding that the law is adhered to.If only it were that simple. Ask two lawyers about national and EU asylum law and you get three opinions on whether Germany is obliged to take in everyone who claims asylum on their borders and examine their claims.The CSU don’t care for such subtleties and on Sunday afternoon leaders will decide whether this week’s summit conclusions are wirkungsadäquat – adequate in their effect – to closing Germany’s national borders.If not, CSU leader Horst Seehofer, also federal interior minister, has promised to phone the federal police and instruct them to act. Dr Merkel has warned she will view this as insubordination and will kick Mr Seehofer out of cabinet, with his CSU cabinet allies sure to follow.It would be a staggering rupture in German post-war politics and end a unique, 69-year political marriage between the CDU and the more conservative CSU.But now we’re into irreconcilable differences territory. While Angela Merkel has Horst Seehofer leaning on her, he has a gun to his head held by Bavarian state premier Markus Söder.Some 105 days ago, the 53-year-old dubbed “Prince of Darkness” grabbed control of the Bavarian state chancellery, but his grip on power could slip away again in 105 days’ time unless he can beat back the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).Just how much mood has tipped against the chancellor was clear when a commentator on the public television evening news urged her to “vacate the chancellery for a successor whose name is not as burdened as yours”.Söder’s attacks on Merkel and on “asylum tourists” – borrowed from the AfD – have proven a dog whistle for conservatives in the chancellor’s own CDU. They are exhausted by 18 years of pragmatic Merkel politics they feel has left their party a husk of its former self.“The CDU majority was happy to lean back and let Merkel win elections for them but now she is viewed as toxic,” said one close ally of ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl.For all the unhappiness with Merkel, though, it is neither clear who feels most entitled to succeed her nor have any of her vocal critics shown an appetite to wield the political knife and create a vacancy in the chancellery.Even if the CSU gives Merkel a reprieve on Sunday evening, her political obituary has been written. The once dominant chancellor, and her incremental pragmatic stlye, are out of step with what one German analyst this week dubbed a new era of “egomaniac, muscular” leadership that blends refugee, trade, security and identity politics.In a week when Germans had their illusions shattered on the football field, Angela Merkel may shuffle up and down the stairs of power a while yet. But like a figure in an Escher illustration, it’s not clear if she has anywhere left to go."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3548799.1530312858!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"merkel in bid to save german coalition with asylum seeker deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar, French president Emmanuel Macron, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban and German chancellor Angela Merkel at an EU summit   breakfast meeting in Brussels. Photograph: Virginia MayoAPGerman chancellor Angela Merkel has faced down her rebellious coalition allies after securing EU and bilateral agreements to reduce asylum seeker numbers in Europe and Germany. There were indications on Friday night that the deal reached after marathon talks at the EU summit in Brussels would be enough to prevent the collapse this weekend of Germany’s newly formed coalition government.Dr Merkel’s hardline interior minister, Horst Seehofer of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), had threatened to close German borders to asylum seekers from Monday in the absence of satisfactory burden-sharing deals on migration at the Brussels summit.The executive board of the CSU, a sister party to Dr Merkel’s CDU, is to meet on Sunday to decide whether the results of the Brussels summit go far enough to meet its demands.Leaders agreed on a number of measures including the establishment of asylum-processing centres both inside and outside the EU, as well as a beefing-up of the EU’s border force, Frontex. Much of what was agreed was aspirational in tone, however, and practical details remained to be worked out.Neither Mr Seehofer nor Bavarian state premier Markus Söder, also of the CSU, responded immediately to the deal, but other senior party figures called the Brussels paper an encouraging signal that could be the basis of compromise.The proposed reception control centres to be set up under the deal will be established only in EU states that volunteer to host them.This prompted Hungary’s prime minister to claim “a great victory” for the so-called Visegrad group, comprising Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which has resisted attempts to impose migrant quotas on all member states.The isive debate over migration dominated the two-day summit, but concerns also emerged that EU leaders are likely to reject anticipated British proposals to remain in the single market for goods, raising the prospect of a mid-summer breakdown in the Brexit negotiations.The British are expected to produce the proposals for partial membership of the single market and customs union in a White Paper after a crunch cabinet meeting next week.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said on Friday that British prime minister Theresa May briefed him on the White Paper at a bilateral meeting at the EU summit on Thursday night and that he warned her there was “no point” in producing proposals that would be rejected by the EU.EU leaders made clear that any British proposals for partial membership of the single market would be regarded as “cherrypicking” and would not be acceptable.Officials fear rejection of the heavily leaked British proposals could prompt the negotiations to come to a full stop in the coming weeks. Talks are due to begin again next week.The Taoiseach said that while there could be special arrangements for the North, these could not be extended to the whole of the UK. “That would really be the beginning of the end of the single market. We really regret that the UK has decided to leave the European Union. We are not going to let them destroy the European Union,” he said. Following summit conclusions that urged member states to prepare for all eventualities including no-deal Brexit, Mr Varadkar said the Government would bring forward contingency planning for the event of a no-deal Brexit. However, he said the Government would not prepare for the reimposition of a hard border."},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest recognises spectacular photos taken within the last two years, with entries in three categories: Nature, People and Cities. REIKO TAKAHASHI - National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year Contest - Mermaid I was fortunate to have encountered a humpback whale with her calf on my first day snorkeling near Japan’s Kumejima Island.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

Part two takes a closer look at the Seventies - from Zandra Rhodes’ Queen costumes to the DIY punk explosion.Ian Gillan went to see the show with his girlfriend. He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Usually after brushing his teeth. Or when stopping by the bathroom, or anywhere with a mirror.He hooks an index finger into each side of his mouth and pulls gently upward. He puckers his face into a kiss, then opens wide into an O, trying to limber up his facial muscles.

Immediately after his birth, doctors whisked him away to another hospital in another state – the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. His mother didn’t see him again until he was eight days old.The doctor told Kevin’s parents that the chance of him surviving was slim.\u0026nbspBut survive he did. However, the large tumour and the damage from its treatment prevented him from being able to do one of the most fundamental things humans do.\u0026nbspSmile.Most babies are born immediately able to communicate with the world around them in one way: by crying.The second signal babies send out is a smile. Newborns can smile spontaneously, as a reflex. This is sometimes misinterpreted by new parents as a reaction to their presence, a reward for their intense concern and sleepless efforts. However, it’s not until six to eight weeks of age that babies smile in a social way. Blind babies do this at the same time.That new parents sometimes optimistically interpret the first reflex smiles as meaning something more underscores the duality of smiling: there is the physical act, and then the interpretation society gives to it.\u0026nbspThe smile, and what the smile means.On a physical level, a smile is clear enough. There are 17 pairs of muscles controlling expression in the human face, plus a singular muscle, the orbicularis oris, a ring that goes entirely around the mouth.When the brain either reacts to a stimulus spontaneously or decides to form an expression intentionally, a message is sent out over the sixth and seventh cranial nerves. These branch across each side of the face from the eyebrows to the chin, connecting to a combination of muscles controlling the lips, nose, eyes and forehead.The basic upward curving smile is achieved primarily by two pairs of zygomaticus muscles, major and minor. These connect the corners of the mouth to the temples, tugging lips upward – often accompanied, depending on the underlying emotions and thoughts, by the levator labii superioris, raising the upper lip, and other muscles of the face.And as for the oft-cited folk wisdom about how it takes more muscles to frown than smile – the jury’s still out, especially as different smiles require different numbers of muscles. However, one source suggests that a genuine smile takes about as many muscles as a frown (and that a particularly insincere kind of smile might take not much more than the pair of risorius muscles).It is when we leave the realm of physiognomy, however, that the smile becomes enigmatic. This contraction of various facial muscles resonates across the entire arc of human history, from the grinning Greek kouros sculptures of 2,500 years ago right up to emoji, those little images that pepper our online communications.One study of smartphone users from 60 countries showed that emoji with smiling faces are by far the most prevalent in messages. The most popular overall – the face with tears of joy – was picked as the 2015 Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries. \u0026nbspJust as this emoji expresses more than mere happiness – tears adding the ironic twist so popular online – smiles themselves can convey so much more than happiness. Interpreting their nuances is a challenge whether dealing with art history or interpersonal encounters or the cutting edge of artificial intelligence.A 2016 study, published in the Journal of Nonverbal Behaviour, questioned thousands of people in 44 cultures about sets of photographs of eight faces – four smiling, four not.In most of these cultures, people deemed the smiling faces to be more honest than the non-smiling ones. This difference was huge in some countries, such as Switzerland, Australia and the Philippines, but small in others, such as Pakistan, Russia and France. And in a few countries, such as Iran, India and Zimbabwe, there was no trustworthiness benefit to smiling at all.Why? That question is also complicated, but in essence, the researchers concluded it has to do with whether a society is set up so that its members assume that other people are dealing with them honestly. “Greater corruption levels decreased trust granted towards smiling iniduals,” the authors concluded.That attitude harks back to a very old view of smiling as being opposed to pious solemnity. There is exactly one smile in the Old Testament – Job, ironically – though in many passages faces are said to “shine”, which could mean smiling or could mean heavenly radiance.Eastern religions often use the smile to denote enlightenment. The literal name of the 1000-year-old Flower Sermon, which describes the origin of Zen Buddhism, is: “Pick up flower, subtle smile.”\u0026nbspThe Buddha and various religious figures were depicted with serene smiles, though the original Buddhist texts are as devoid of smiling as Western scripture. Jesus weeps but never smiles.Nor did Kevin Portillo, not fully. He did not smile on schedule. At five weeks old, he was already a week into chemotherapy with vincristine, an anticancer drug so powerful it can cause bone pain and skin rashes. Doctors warned his mother that the treatment might leave him blind, or deaf, or unable to walk.“If he survived,” says his mother, Silvia Portillo, in Spanish, speaking through a translator. “The doctor always said he could not give us hope that he would survive.”Whether stunted due to the tumour or killed by the chemo, Kevin’s seventh cranial nerve withered. That nerve originates at the brainstem then branches out across the face. It is susceptible not only to tumours, as in Kevin’s case, but also to rare conditions such as Moebius syndrome, a congenital facial paralysis caused by missing or stunted cranial nerves. You can’t smile, frown, or move your eyes from side to side.“You essentially have a mask on your face,” says Roland Bienvenu, 67, a Texan with Moebius syndrome.Without being able to smile, others “can get the incorrect impression of you,” says Bienvenu. “You can almost read their thoughts. They wonder, ‘Is something wrong with him? Has he had an accident?’ They question your intellectual ability, think maybe he’s got some intellectual disability since he’s got this blank look on his face.”A lopsided smile can be as problematic as no smile at all.“I have half a smile, so even with that I am able to successfully convey emotion,” writes Dawn Shawn, born with a teratoma – a fast-growing tumour that was interfering with her windpipe.“The hardest part for me was seeing photos of myself smiling, because smiling exaggerates the fact that half my face doesn’t move very much. But eventually I learned to own it. That is me. That is how I look.”The challenges stemming from lack of a smile are frequently compounded. When people have a medical condition severe enough to keep them from smiling, other difficulties tend to be involved.“He was different than the other kids,” says Silvia of her son. “He was fed for four years through the G-tube in his stomach. He wasn’t able to have a normal life, because every few hours he had to be connected to the machine to be fed.” Little kids, being curious, would look and ask what happened to him, she says.While those who cannot smile can blame the state of their facial nerves and muscles, those who can smile are often concerned with a different aspect of physiognomy: their teeth. More than $3bn is spent worldwide on teeth-whitening products, with billions more spent on braces and on purely cosmetic dentistry: straightening crooked teeth, for instance, or reducing the amount of gum that shows when a person smiles.Caring for the state of your teeth is not a modern concern. The Romans had dentists and used chewing sticks and toothpaste. They preferred dazzling white smiles, sometimes rinsing their teeth in urine to enhance the effect.Contrary to common modern perceptions, the ancients had surprisingly good teeth, for reasons that have nothing to do with dentistry. A CAT scan of 30 adult bodies recovered at Pompeii found they had “perfect teeth”.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1350 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1450 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1550 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1650 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1750 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively1850 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2050 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.650 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.750 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.850 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 950 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1050 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1150 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

Prior to the French Revolution, broad smiles in art were overwhelmingly the realm of the lewd, the drunk and the boisterous lower classes.“The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom,” John Baptist de La Salle wrote in his 1703 The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility, allowing that people might, under certain circumstances, convey the impression that they are happy, provided it is done within limits.“There are some people who raise their upper lip so high or let the lower lip sag so much that their teeth are almost entirely visible. This is entirely contrary to decorum, which forbids you to allow your teeth to be uncovered, for nature gave us lips to conceal them…”In The Smile Revolution in Eighteenth Century Paris, Colin Jones argues that smiling reflected the gathering sense of inidual worth that went along with the beheading of kings:This shift in social practices and in sensibilities involved the emergence of the perception, common in our own day, that the smile offered a key to inidual identity. In late eighteenth-century Paris, the smile came to be viewed as symbol of an inidual’s innermost and most authentic self. In a way that was perceived as both novel and modern, it was held to reveal the character of the person within.Photography, by capturing smiles, eventually helped popularise them. But the sitters in 19th-century photographs still rarely smiled, a neutral continence being both easier to hold over the long exposure necessary at the time and less likely to detract from the gravity of the occasion.“A photograph is a most important document, and there is nothing more damning to go down to posterity than a silly, foolish smile caught and fixed forever,” humorist Mark Twain was quoted as remarking in the 1913 memoir of an acquaintance.Around the same time, however, Kodak in the US launched extensive advertising campaigns to help consumers see photography as a means of recording joyous events and celebrations.Over the century, smiles showed a confidence in keeping with the rise of modern capitalism. “An insincere grin? That doesn’t fool anybody,” Dale Carnegie wrote in his 1936 bestseller, How to Win Friends and Influence People, embraced as a life guide by millions.“We know it is mechanical and we resent it. I am talking about a real smile, a heartwarming smile, a smile that comes from within, the kind of smile that will bring a good price in the marketplace.”Part of the attractiveness of smiles is they are so easily extended. Part of their menace is that they can also be just as easily withheld.“For a salesman, there’s no rock bottom to the life,” Charlie says at the end of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman. “He don’t put a bolt to a nut, he don’t tell you the law or give you medicine. He’s a man way out there in the blue, riding on a smile and a shoeshine. And when they start not smiling back – that’s an earthquake.”Once Kevin was able to eat food, go to school and enjoy usual childhood pastimes – he became passionate about soccer and playing the drums – he still felt the tremors of having a half-smile in a world solidly established upon “a cultural expectation of pearly perfection”, as Richard Barnett writes in his book The Smile Stealers.“I couldn’t smile on my left, I only smiled on my right,” says Kevin. “My smile was weird … people kept asking what happened to me, why I\u0027m like this. I keep telling them I was like this when I was born.”If you see someone in a wheelchair, you anticipate that the person might have trouble walking and assume a physical condition is involved. But facial paralysis carries no telltale equipment, and is rare enough that the unaffected population is not generally familiar with the conditions that cause it, whether congenital or appearing later in life.One of the latter is Bell’s palsy, an inflammation of the sheathing around the facial nerves on one side that paralyses half the face, causing the eye and corner of the mouth to droop. It usually strikes men and women between the ages of 15 and 60.In most cases temporary, Bell’s palsy generally slowly goes away as mysteriously as it arrives. Doctors suspect it is caused by a viral infection. There are also traumatic events – car wrecks, sporting accidents – that damage nerves and muscles in the face, plus congenital irregularities such as cleft palate.A common condition that can also affect the smile is stroke. A sagging smile or face drooped on one side is one of three signs that a person has had a stroke and needs immediate emergency care (the other two are weakness or numbness in one arm, and slurred or garbled speech).While losing a smile is a serious blow at any age, it can have a particular impact on younger people, who are starting out, forming the bonds that will carry them through the rest of their lives.\u0026nbspOr trying to.“It’s a huge problem,” says Tami Konieczny, supervisor of occupational therapy at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP). “When you look at somebody, the first thing you see is their face, their ability to smile or not smile, or an asymmetrical smile. It’s your social world.“If someone can’t read your facial expressions, then it’s difficult to be socially accepted. It’s hugely devastating for kids. I had kids photoshopping their pictures. They are taking mirror images of their good side and copying it, photoshopping their own pictures before posting them to social media.”Photoshopping might work on Facebook. But fixing a smile bisected by nerve damage and subsequent muscle loss – Kevin couldn’t move the muscles on the left side of his face, so they atrophied – is far more complicated. Sometimes, it requires multi-stage plastic surgery spread out over a year or more.There are two major procedures available for facial reanimation, according to Phuong Nguyen, a plastic surgeon and reconstructive surgeon at CHoP.The newest, which has its roots in older techniques, is called a lengthening temporalis myoplasty – taking part of the broad band of muscle that powers the jaws and repurposing it to draw up the lips.That wasn’t ideal for Kevin because he had one side of his face working. The older, more complicated surgery was better suited to him.“Kevin had the most commonly done one, a classic two-stage cross-face nerve graft followed by a free gracilis muscle transfer,” says Nguyen. “To be perfectly honest, when Kevin had his stage, we weren’t familiar with the lengthening temporalis myoplasty procedure yet.”Nguyen later learned the new procedure from facial reanimation pioneer Ronald Zuker, a Canadian plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and from its originator, French surgeon Daniel Labbé.“My preference is to do it when kids are five years of age,” says Zuker. “At the time, if I can restore a smile for them, they can go to primary school, meet kids on the playground, meet kids in class. They have their smiles and are well-equipped to handle that situation.”Why put children through what is still elective surgery?“It’s incredibly important to be able to interact with humans on a face-to-face basis,” says Zuker. “If you don’t have the ability to smile, you are at a disadvantage. People cannot understand your inner emotions. They mistake your appearance for being disinterested, or not too bright, or not very involved in the conversation.”Still, some parents prefer to wait until their children are older and can participate in the decision.“If families want to wait, that’s perfectly fine,” says Zuker. “Sometimes when a kid is nine or 10 they look in the mirror and say, ‘You know, I really want this surgery.’ That’s the time to do it.”Which is what happened with Kevin. He was doing well, “even with that scar on his face, has always been popular at school,” says his mother. “He’s always been a happy kid.”But there were kids that made fun of him, she says. One day when he was about nine, he was sad. “I said, ‘What happened to you?’ He said, ‘Some kids, they’re not my friends. They laugh at me because I look funny.’ It was really hard for us as parents.”“We always wanted the surgery,” she says. “But we were told it was impossible. We had to wait to see how everything was changing.”At age 10, Kevin told his parents that he wanted to do what most people do without giving it a second thought. He knew it would be a long, painful, difficult procedure, but it was one he wanted to undergo.“He’s very engaging, very motivated,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his occupational therapist at CHoP. “His goal, I wrote in my notes, was to have a symmetrical smile.”As with smiles themselves, so the scientific study of smiles reflects the cleavage between the physical and the interpretive. The physical side is entwined with the long history of plastic surgery, which has tended to focus on survivors of diseases like syphilis and of the knives of vengeful authorities and warlords.The father of modern plastic surgery, Harold Gillies, reported in 1934 that restoring the ability to smile made patients’ faces “feel much more comfortable”. In addition, Gillies observed, “the psychological effect is also one of considerable value”.On the interpretive side, Charles Darwin discusses the meaning and value of smiles in his 1872 landmark The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Like many, Darwin sees a smile as the first part of a continuum.“A smile, therefore, may be said to be the first stage in the development of a laugh,” \u0026nbsphe writes, then reverses course, musing that perhaps the smile is instead the remnant of laughter.He observes his own infants closely, detecting in two their first smiles at six weeks, and earlier in the third. He comments how smiles do more than merely convey happiness, mentioning the “derisive or sardonic smile” and the “unnatural or false smile”, and showing photos to see if his associates can read what they mean.The scientific study of smiles finds differences in gender (generally, women smile more) and culture. Smiles are definitely communicative – people smile more when in public than they do when alone, and more when interacting with others than when not.Scientists have shown that smiles are far easier to recognise than other expressions. What they don’t know is why.“We can do really well recognising smiles,” says Aleix Martinez, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Ohio State University and founder of its Computational Biology and Cognitive Science Lab.“Why is that true? Nobody can answer that right now. We don’t know. We really do not know. We have a classical experiment, where we showed images of facial expressions to people, but we showed them very rapidly… 10 milliseconds, 20 milliseconds.“People can detect a smile even in exposures smaller than 10 milliseconds. I can show you an image for just 10 milliseconds and you can tell me it’s a smile. It does not work with any other expression.”Fear takes an exposure time of 250 milliseconds to recognise – 25 times as long as a smile, “which makes absolutely no sense, evolutionarily speaking,” Martinez says. “Recognising fear is fundamental to survival, while a smile… But that’s how we are wired.”Studies have shown that smiling faces are judged as more familiar than neutral ones. And it’s not just us that can recognise smiles more easily. “This is true both for humans and for machines,” says Martinez. Alibaba, China’s answer to Amazon, launched its new facial recognition payment system called “Smile to Pay” in September 2017.Although scientists have been studying smiles for about 150 years, they are still at the stage of trying to count and categorise types of smile among the millions of possible facial expressions.“One of the fundamental questions in the scientific literature right now is how many facial expressions do we actually produce?” says Martinez. “Nobody knows.”Scientists such as Martinez theorise that smiles – as well as frowns and other facial expressions – are remnants of humanity’s distant pre-linguistic heritage. Human language started developing as far back as 100,000 years ago, but our expressions reach back further still, even to before our origins as human beings.“Before we could communicate verbally, we had to communicate with our faces,” Martinez says. “Which brings us to a very interesting, very fundamental question in science: where does language come from? Language is not fossilised, not found in any other living species. How could something that complex have evolved from nothingness?”One of the hypotheses is that it evolved through facial expression of emotion, he says. “First we learned to move our facial muscles – ‘I’m happy. I feel positive with you! I’m angry. I feel disgust.’ Then language came through a grammaticalisation of facial expressions, which over time evolved into what we call grammar and language.”In October 2015, Nguyen, who plays in a band, cranked up some rock music in the operating room at CHoP – he thinks it was probably something from the Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream.He began work by removing a section of sural nerve from Kevin’s right ankle and attaching it to the working right side of his face, running it underneath his upper lip, to the paralysed left.“We bring it across, parking it, waiting for nerves to regrow from the right side to the left,” Nguyen says.That growth took almost a year. The nerve fibres advanced about a millimetre a day (about 24,000 times slower than a snail).In nerve grafts like this, many of the fibres don’t make it across. This means that the nerve can lose the ability to transmit information – in a few cases, completely.“The thing with nerve-based surgery, you don’t get a lot of instant gratification or feedback,” says Nguyen. “You do the procedure and don’t know if it works or not. You have to wait.”During that time, doctors would periodically tap areas of Kevin’s cheek, to see if the nerve was taking. “When it tingles, you know the nerve is growing,” says Nguyen.The body has a way of covering losses. Removing that nerve did cause a small patch of skin on Kevin’s ankle to go numb. But as he was still growing, the numb patch began to shrink as the neural network took over its function.Once Nguyen was certain the nerve was in place and functioning, it was time for the second stage of the surgery.The mystery of Mona Lisa\u0027s smile has finally been solved Mona Lisa smile \u0027based on his gay lover\u0027, art historian claimsRussian Mona Lisa could be genuineSecrets of the Mona Lisa, BBC2, TV review: the face behind the paintOne morning in August 2016, he took a purple marker and wrote a “P” on Kevin’s left temple and an “NP” on his right, for “paralysed” and “not paralysed”, a common surgical precaution against the risk of cutting into the wrong side of a patient – easier than you might imagine, considering how much of a patient’s body is draped before surgery.“It happens,” says Nguyen. “You want to make it idiot-proof.” \u0026nbspHe also drew a pair of parallel lines, marking the location of a prime artery, and an arrow: the vector Kevin’s smile would take.The surgeon made an incision from the temporal hair line, in front of Kevin’s left ear, then pivoting back under and behind it, extending into his neck – the standard location for hiding plastic surgery scars. The skin on a face peels back easily. He attached three sutures to the inside corner of Kevin’s mouth and gently pulled, to gauge exactly where the muscle should be attached.“So you know it’s in the right place,” explains Nguyen. “If you don’t get this right, they’re going to have to live with it for the rest of their life.”The moment Nguyen put strain on the triple surgical thread was the first time Kevin Portillo ever smiled on the left side of his face.That done, Nguyen removed a 12-centimetre segment of gracilis muscle, along with a section of artery and vein, from the inside of Kevin’s left thigh, as well as the obturator nerve. The muscle was secured in place by a customised splint that hooked into Kevin’s mouth and was sewn to the side of his head to keep the relocated muscle from pulling out before it healed.The section was taken from Kevin’s thigh because the powerful upper leg is rich in muscles. “There are so many muscles that do the same function… you don’t miss this,” Nguyen says.Well… most wouldn’t miss it. Kevin, a diehard young soccer fan, did. “When the surgery came I couldn’t play,” he says. “I didn’t know it would take that long. I thought it would take a couple days and I would be back.”Just how long was he sidelined?“It was more than two weeks,” he says, sorrowfully.“He wasn’t concerned with how serious the surgery was,” his mother says, laughing. “He was more concerned with not being able to play soccer.”Over the next year, Kevin began to get motion on the left side of his mouth.“It’s really kind of a magical thing,” says Nguyen. “We do this procedure, a number of hours and effort, using not a small amount of resources. We don’t know if it works or not.“I saw him post-operatively within the first couple of weeks, he looked like he had this big bulgy thing in his cheek. Nothing was moving. All of a sudden, he was smiling. It was a really incredible moment.”Well, it’s magical, but it’s also hard work. Low-tech and high-tech.\u0026nbspKevin begins his regular occupational therapy session by holding a two-cent white plastic fork in his mouth and showing that he can move it up and down.“Try to purse your lips together to make it stand up,” says Anne-Ashley Field, his therapist at CHoP. “We’ve got it pretty solid in the middle. Try to work it over to the weaker side. Nice try… and that’s harder.”Kevin puts on purple latex gloves and pulls at the inside of his cheek.“You’re going to do your stretch on the inside,” says Field. “A nice, slow hold. Good. Bring that thumb up… Do you feel like it’s getting looser than it was?”“Mmm-hmmm,” Kevin agrees, gloved fingers in mouth.She takes some photos. There is a lot of photography in facial therapy, to track progress.“Now give me the biggest open-mouthed smile you can,” says Field. “Good. Can you make the left side go up even more? Try to make your gums even.”Then, after more exercises, she asks if he is ready for the computer work.They move into the next room, to a $20,000 Lenovo biometric therapy system. Field sticks a surface EMG – an oblong black sensor that reads electrical activity in the muscle – to Kevin’s left cheek and he plays a video game, Load Ship, where he moves animated boxes from a conveyor on the screen by smiling and relaxing.“Give me a big smile,” Field says, calibrating the device. “And relax.”He plays for four minutes, the game burbling a skittery kind of jazzy electronic music.They play a few other games: one trying to get a man to a safe spot as two serrated blue spaces come together. Then a marble maze.“How are you feeling?” she asks.“Hurts,” he replies.Physical rehabilitation is the part of the surgical process that often gets overlooked, but it can make the difference between success and failure.“It’s huge, particularly with facial palsy,” says Nguyen. “You can do technically very sound surgery on two completely different patients and have two completely different outcomes based on how involved they are with their own therapy… It just doesn’t look as good.”How does Kevin feel about being able to fully smile after a lifetime of not being able to?“I’ve been getting better on how I react. I do it automatically,” says Kevin. “Sometimes when somebody says a joke. It actually feels great now. Before it felt weird to not smile. Smiling with both sides of my mouth at same time, I feel I’m one of the other people who smiles right.”His mother remembers the moment she noticed.“We were at the table, we were eating,” says Silvia. “And then we said, ‘Kevin, are you moving there?’ He started moving. Not the way he was doing today little movements.”“We were eating,” he says. “I think she said something funny, and I just smiled.”And how does smiling affect his life?“Before, I was actually shy,” he says. “Right now, I’m less shy, more active.”“I used to have trouble expressing my emotions. Now people know if I’m smiling or laughing. When I laughed, before, I laughed weird. And right now, they know, bit by bit, that I was trying to smile, I was expressing my laughter and my smile. When I play soccer, and score a goal, I’m happy. I’m smiling, to tell everybody I scored.”You’d be forgiven for thinking that classifying and counting the different types of smile would be straightforward. It’s anything but.In the mid 19th century, French neurologist Guillaume Duchenne wanted to distinguish real smiles from fake. Interested in the response of nerves and muscles to stimulation, he applied electricity to particular parts of faces to see the results.He ided smiles into two groups: those that involved the crinkling of the eyes – sincere smiles – and those that used only the muscles around the mouth – insincere smiles.Today, the full smile that uses the muscles around the mouth and eyes is known as a “Duchenne smile” – and the fake one is the “Pan Am smile”, after the kind of smile you might greet someone with if it’s part of your job to be friendly.In 1974, Leonard Rubin described three basic types of smile, based on his study of 100 people:The “Mona Lisa”, where the corners of the mouth go up and outwards and the upper teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the zygomaticus major. About two-thirds of people studied smile this wayThe “canine” smile, where the canine teeth are exposed. The dominant muscle action is from the levator labii superioris. 31 per cent of people smiled like thisThe “full dentured”, where the lips are pulled back strongly, showing both upper and lower rows of teeth. All muscles are equally dominant. Just 2 per cent of people were found to smile this wayCosmetic surgeons, who have to be meticulous in identifying the smiles that their patients are paying good money to try to achieve, call these three types commissure, cuspid and complex, respectively.Phuong Nguyen, a Philadelphia plastic and reconstructive surgeon, attempts to clarify the matter using celebrities. The Mona Lisa, he says, is the Angelina Jolie. The Tom Cruise smile is a canine smile, and a Julia Roberts is the full dentured smile. This is a subjective matter. Other doctors place Jolie in the second or third categories.Smiling is not a realm given over to easy description. Contemplate the ideal smile as recounted by one clinician in the Journal of Clinical Orthodontics:An optimal smile is characterised by an upper lip that reaches the gingival margins, with an upward or straight curvature between the philtrum and commissures an upper incisal line coincident with the border of the lower lip minimal or no lateral negative space a commissural line and occlusal frontal plane parallel to the pupillary line and harmoniously integrated dental and gingival components.The total number of different types of smile is frequently debated. A recent BBC article gave the total as 19.Arguably the most important researcher into smiles over the past 30 years has been Paul Ekman at the University of California. His 1978 Facial Action Coding System, written with Wallace V Friesen, seeks to create an atlas of nearly all possible human expressions. Ekman says, in his book Telling Lies, that their technique for measuring the face can distinguish over 50 different smiles.Confused? You’re not the only one.

But can he be converted?\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineI’ll give her this: she is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me. Hey, whatever floats your boat.\u0026nbspFrom beef to BFFs to beef again: Kanye West and Taylor SwiftNEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13:   Kanye West (L) jumps onstage after Taylor Swift (C) won the Best Female Video award during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall on September 13, 2009 in New York City.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

Some called her a “traitor”.In her separate letter, calling the crisis meeting for 28 July, the MP pointed out that she had been praised by some cabinet ministers for her “courage” in fighting a hard Brexit.“I will continue to support the Prime Minister towards this soft Brexit.

He added that “time is very short” and said UK negotiators should return to Brussels on Monday to intensify talks.The EU says a deal must be struck before October to stop Britain crashing out of the bloc in March without a transition period – a scenario that would be expected to cause economic chaos.Theresa May on Thursday night addressed leaders over dinner about Brexit for 10 minutes but her speech was apparently overshadowed by hours of discussions about the EU migration crisis, the main focus of the summit.\u0026nbspdidn’t realise Theresa May had made a speech in BrusselsAsked about Ms May’s dinner speech on Friday morning, Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, looked confused, and said: “There was a speech? Haha.”The joint statement signed off by the leaders on Friday, which was leaked to The Independent in advance, said coming to a deal “requires further clarity as well as realistic and workable proposals from the UK”.“The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland,” it read.“It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal.\u0026nbsp“It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.”The motion says that the Council urges “member states, Union institutions and all stakeholders to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes” – diplomatic reference to a “no-deal”\u0026nbspscenario.\u0026nbspThe main sticking point in talks is how to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The UK has flat-out rejected EU plans to give a special status to Northern Ireland that would effectively keep it in the customs union and single market, and says any deal must apply to the whole UK and be time limited. The EU says UK plans so far are not enough to prevent a hard border from happening.The UK also wants to time-limit the policy to placate Brexiteers who fear it could be used to keep Britain in the single market indefinitely, but the EU says it would not accept this.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

No one’s got a f**king clue what Brexit is. You watch Question Time, it’s comedy.”But with the Labour leader sitting opposite, the actor replied: “No, I ain’t got a clue, no one knows what it is – it’s like this mad riddle and no one knows what it is, right.“So what’s happened to that twat David Cameron who called it on?“Let’s be fair, how come he can scuttle off? He called all this on, where is he? In Europe, in Nice, with his trotters up, where is the geezer? I think he should be held to account for it.”Mr Corbyn, who insisted he voted to remain in the EU, later managed to contribute to the debate by saying: “The government who is meant to be negotiating spends its time negotiating with itself.

Key MEP warns \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo chances RISING as Brexit deadline approachesMr\u0026nbspLongworth pointed out that Airbus is mostly owned by the French and German governments who are bent on ensuring that Brexit is not a success.He said: \u0026ldquoThis is classic of a foreign multinational that clearly cares less about the UK but is trying to dictate our future.

And he was right.Likewise when Boris Johnson said “f*** business” after Airbus threatened to pull jobs out of Britain post-Brexit, he wasn’t declaring war on firms that employ thousands of people.He was sick of the complaints from foreign companies with a vested interest in keeping the EU sweet — and in lobbying groups like the CBI which back Brussels over Britain.Of course the Tories are keen to ensure Brexit does as little damage as possible to businesses. Job-creation has been their biggest success since 2010.And of course the lack of certainty is worrying some firms. But they, in turn, need to understand this Government’s duty to honour the referendum in full.It cannot abandon red-line commitments — to end free movement, or to trade independently around the world — because big companies which have thrived within the EU don’t like them.Brussels is used to riding roughshod over inconvenient votes. That cannot and must not happen here.The sooner the EU’s corporate supporters grasp it the better.WHY is it OK for every country but England to show off their national pride?The Scots, Welsh, Irish, French, Americans — they love to see their flags adorning homes, offices and streets.Here, the left has made it borderline shameful to put up a St George cross. To them it means you’re parochial and even racist.It is time we killed off that myth and showed the same pride in our flag as the world does in theirs.What better time to start than with Harry Kane’s boys off to a flier in Russia?

And, indeed, free trade is what most people thought they were ­voting for in the 2016 referendum.Free trade, cunningly styled “no deal” by pro-Remain spin doctors, has always been the best option, but has become even more attractive, now that the intransigence and arrogance of EU ­negotiators has become clear.Fair play, Theresa May and David Davis — you gave the negotiations with the EU your best shot but it’s now time to take the road to freedom.Carping critics say they could have done better, but the public instinctively knows that you’ve tried hard and that it takes two to tango.So, let’s be bold and scrap all tariffs on Brexit day, March 29, 2019.It will immediately boost living ­standards, by reducing prices, and will be especially beneficial for the less well-off. Juncker will cry into his claret at the new, competitive UK.Even companies such as BMW and Airbus, which urged us to join the euro and asked their workers to vote Remain, will benefit.Their engines, and other components imported from the EU, would continue to be free of tariffs. However, ­components from outside the EU would also become tariff-free, which is not usually the case today. Not only that, but their workers would be better off too, which is a plus for any business.And instead of sending £39billion into Brussels’ unaudited coffers, let’s invest the money here.Dividing it equally among our 650 MPs would allow each one to spend £60million in their constituency, on local projects. If MPs don’t like that suggestion, the £39billion could instead be used to reduce taxes or government debt. Our democratically elected Parliament can debate the best approach and decide.Most of us understand Chancellor Philip Hammond’s dogged attempts to get public expenditure under control, after the trauma of the credit crunch.But, it must make sense to invest this money in the UK, rather than the EU.Finally, free of Juncker’s shackles, we can regain control of our fishing waters, boosting the morale and income of our beleaguered coastal communities.No longer will 60 per cent of fish in UK waters be landed by EU boats.The public, too, has its role to play now. Project Fear, promoted by the CBI, the Financial Times and big businesses, has tried to frighten us with threats of gridlocked Channel ports and lorry parks across Kent when we leave the EU.Few believe them, but let’s call their bluff. UK consumers and businesses should now start to favour and prefer non-EU and British products wherever possible, dramatically reducing pressure on those ports.Wetherspoon has started by swapping champagne for UK and Aussie sparkling wine, and German wheat beer for the English and Welsh equivalent.As a result of this tactic, the public is benefitting from equal or better quality and lower prices. And there are a large number of other EU products that can be replaced in all pubs and supermarkets in the next year or two.The public instinctively understands the benefits of world trade, so let’s make buying non-EU a national goal for the next few years.It’s tough on our excellent EU ­suppliers, of course, but that’s the price the continent is paying, unfortunately, for a failing and undemocratic system, with unelected apparatchiks like Juncker and Barnier in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And for the sake of society, it is absolutely right that this twisted soul was sentenced to life and should remain behind bars for decades.But the truth is that Kouider is not your average female inmate. In fact, she’s almost one of a kind.In the age of “equality”, it’s not fashionable to say that men and women are ­different. But when it comes to ­criminality, there can be no argument.Women make up a ­vanishingly small minority of those in the criminal justice system, representing less than five per cent — and in all but the most exceptional of ­circumstances, the crimes that get them incarcerated are, to put it plainly, petty.In 2016, more women were sent to prison to serve a sentence for theft than for violence against the person, robbery, sexual offences, fraud, drugs and ­motoring offences combined — and 80 per cent of those locked up for theft were shoplifters.In the past decade, the number of ­community sentences for women has fallen by nearly half. In 2016 alone, 8,447 women were put behind bars, depriving around 20,000 children of their mothers.These children will now be shunted around family members or placed in care, eating up even more limited resources than the £36,000 it costs to imprison someone for a year.And they will be stigmatised, probably for life, through no fault of their own. Whatever the macho “tough on crime” politicians say, it is plain that nothing is achieved by locking up women for minor offences.If we want to avoid pouring more of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash down the black hole of the broken prison ­system, we need to stop lumping ­vulnerable women in with violent men and start confronting the complex ­reasons behind their rare appearances in the ­justice system.Research shows that women in prison have often been victims of much more serious offences than the ones they are accused of committing.More than half report having experienced emotional, physical or sexual abuse as a child compared to under a third of men behind bars — and 57 per cent report having been ­victims of domestic violence.Depressingly, because many women fear disclosing abuse, both figures are likely to be an underestimate.The abusers, it would seem, are also the ones pushing their female partners into a life of crime.Nearly half of women in prison (48 per cent) questioned for the Surveying ­Prisoner Crime Reduction survey reported having ­committed offences to support someone else’s drug use, ­compared to just 22 per cent of men.Manipulated, under-educated and all but broken, these women suddenly ­surface in the criminal justice system, ­desperate for the help which would enable them to put their lives back on track.But instead of offering it, we treat them just the same as the low-lives who ground them down in the first place.And it’s creating a cycle of crime.Overall, 48 per cent of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year.For those serving sentences of less than 12 months, the reconviction rate rises to 61 per cent.This statistic is hardly surprising when you bear in mind that many women lose everything as a result of imprisonment, and 60 per cent of them don’t have homes to go to on release.Without accommodation, it is much harder to get a job or training ­placement, or arrange benefits or care for children so, understandably, they turn back to petty crime.Women like Kouider must always be locked away and no one is suggesting for one moment that serious crimes should go unpunished. But when you have nearly half of all women in jail to support the drug use of someone else and nearly half having attempted suicide at some point in their lifetime — a figure more than seven times higher than that of the general population — it would very much suggest that ­incarceration is not the wisest response.And at last, the Government is latching on. Justice Secretary David Gauke has now abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation.It may be a small step — vulnerable men are still at risk of falling through the net and Gauke must address that, too — but it’s in the right direction.If we are to stop our shuddering prison system from imploding entirely, we must start by separating the victims from the criminals.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Here, and across the globe. Pourquoi? (That means “why” and is usually accompanied by a shrug and slightly hysterical hand gestures.)Fewer and fewer British kids are learning French in school. The number studying this absurd language has dropped by 30,000 in the past seven years. Instead, our children are learning languages which might actually prove to be useful later on in life.French is useful only if you visit France — and even then they’ll pretend not to understand you.Oh, and a small bunch of arid and desolate African countries which — trust me on this — you are never going to visit. Unless you want a dose of the Ebola virus or your head chopped off. French does not make the top ten of languages spoken worldwide.It only just crawls into the top 20 — between Marathi and Korean, since you asked. Marathi is spoken by some people in India. Not a huge amount of people, frankly. Nice people though, I’m sure.The Africans have learned the utter uselessness of French.In the past few years two countries from that continent have ditched French as the second language and replaced it with — of course — English. That’s Rwanda and Gabon. The switch has proved very popular indeed. More countries are set to follow suit.Do you know where else they don’t speak French any more? France. Well, in French universities. Science subjects such as physics and maths are taught in English.This is because foreign students coming to France don’t want to have to encumber themselves by learning a new language which will be of less use to them later than Swahili or Gaelic.This has been too long in coming. Right now, more and more British schools are switching to Spanish.This makes sense because while 437million people in the world speak Spanish as a first language — i.e. Spain, Central and most of South America — only about 75million speak French.That’s France, half of Belgium and about nine people in Switzerland.But never mind Spanish, important though it is. Foreign languages are too often neglected by British students.And yet we need them to compete in the world. English is the international language of commerce and culture, sure.I would make it compulsory for kids to learn Mandarin from the age of five. And as a second choice, Spanish — which we’re getting good at — or Arabic.Hell, we could do with knowing what that lot are up to. Our security services have struggled because too few English people have any knowledge of Arabic.And how about Russian?We need a bit of a revolution in the way we teach foreign languages here.For too long we have glided by thinking we need to learn nothing. Just a verse or two of Frere Jacques, that’ll do.But the world is changing and our schools need to change with it.Right now they are beginning to do so, but too slowly.Get the kids learning stuff which will help them compete in the world. And shove French in the trash can of history.Ding dang dong, indeed.THE wags seem to have had a nice night out in St Petersburg.Good for them.I do miss Abbey Clancy from the line-up, though.I suppose it would be a bit much to put Peter Crouch up front just so we got a chance to see her again.JUST as the England team looks like it’s going places and everyone’s happy, there’s a beer shortage.This is because of a national shortage of carbon dioxide.How the hell can we have a shortage of THAT?Your average human breathes out almost three pounds of the stuff every day.This is a national crisis and I think I have the answer.We need to get some people who are of no other use to the world to sit in vast vats of flat lager, belching continuously.Diane Abbott, for example.Humans involved in strenuous exercise exhale even more CO2 – maybe 12 pounds a day. So, Diane, on a treadmill, in a vast vat of lager, belching continuously. Yum.SO, the adolescent, unemployable liberal scumbags are still trying to get Donald Trump’s visit to the UK cancelled.Lefties who cannot bear to hear people express different views to their own will be staging infantile protests across London.There are even plans to have a giant blimp of the US president flying across the capital.A typically nasty and childish little prank by people who cannot abide democracy.And who do not care that the US is our major ally – and especially important once we have left the European Union.The protests are being supported by such organisations as ActionAid, which calls itself a charity.Make sure you never give those people any of your money.And one more thing, you protestors. You think Trump is only in power for four years? Think again. He will win again.Just as other populists are winning elections across Europe.The liberals have lost the argument and they are losing at the polls.NOTHING has given me as much pleasure during the World Cup as watching that fat, cheating coke-head Diego Maradona being hauled out of his seat, drunk out of his skull and incapable of standing.Hand of God – yeah. And the septum of Danniella Westbrook.The only downside was that the Argies won their game against Nigeria, undeservedly. They now face France in the next round.Argentina versus France. Like deciding who you want to win in a fist fight between Jeremy Corbyn and Nick Clegg. You kind of hope they’ll annihilate each other and no team goes through.It’s been a great World Cup so far, and very well run by the Russians. Best teams? Croatia, certainly.

Who would have thought?Did he mention that Airbus, who have been warning of plague and pestilence if we dare to leave, have just been found to have received illegal subsidies worth £17billion from . . . the EU?Did he tell his audience that even Financial Times bosses — a paper so comfortable in Brussels’ bosom it could redesign its masthead as a blue-and-yellow brassiere — think German car manufacturers need a UK trade deal, regardless of what BMW say? Did he heck.Big businesses have done very well out of the EU for years. They’ll resist every possible attempt to reform it or improve it and in Greg Clark they’ve got a man unimaginative enough to believe everything they say.There are plenty of other businesses who are looking to the future with confidence and are excited about Britain striking out on their own.And those outfits who are complaining about Brexit will adjust, just as they did when we (thankfully) didn’t join the Euro, because we’ve got the fifth largest economy in the world and they’d be mad to turn their back on us.It’s time the PM backed Brexit voters over corporate doom-mongers.LOVE Island’s Adam is a nasty piece of work.How ITV can justify him still being on the show despite being caught sending sleazy messages to a 17-year-old girl is beyond us.People have been thrown off for much less. ITV’s shameless pursuit of ratings can’t justify him still being there.Boot him.VAR has made the World Cup a much better experience.Rather than arguing about decisions in the pub for years afterward, they get sorted out straight away.Yes, there are niggles. But between Neymar’s ludicrous dive and South Korea’s (wonderful) goal, more ­decisions are right than ever before.Dinosaur Premier League bosses should introduce it next season.The only downside is that it might have ruled out Geoff Hurst’s goal in ’66.But today’s probably painful enough for our German friends...Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The last time we had a summer like this 1976.”She attributed the dangerously high pollen counts to the rainfall in spring that helped grass to grow – with the pollen now released thanks to the warm temperatures.Dr Emberlin warned the stretch of days with a high pollen count could be making it worse for sufferers.She said: “What tends to happen is that people become more sensitive as the season goes on, unless they have controlled their symptoms.“They may develop more symptoms over five to seven days, including getting tired and head aches because of hay fever.”The sneezy season comes as temperatures continue to rise 10C above average - with the weekend again expected to see temperatures in the high 20s and conditions to remain dry and sunny.The Met Offices Ms Chivers said there was an extremely small chance of showers across the south east.She added: We have a very large, high pressure system over the top of us and that means dry weather and cloudless skies.It looks like its going to carry on into next week - theres no end in sight.This week has seen records tumble, with four days crowned the hottest day of the year.Highs were recorded across the UK -  making it the first time in five years that temperatures have hit 30C in all four nations of the UK.The hottest temperatures recorded were 33C in Porthmadog, Wales.But the heatwave has sparked health warnings with conditions expected to remain hot and sunny over the weekend.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert remains at level two, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Authorities have also issued warnings to cut shower times down to just four minutes as temperatures continue to sizzle.With no rain on the horizon, the South East is set for its driest June since records began.The heat has caused havoc for commuters after rail services imposed speed limits on trains due to overheating tracks caused by the steel on tracks to expand and sometimes buckle.South Western Railway said temperatures were expected to reach 47C on many parts of its route this week.The heatwave could even top a blistering 38C in the coming months, raising fears this summer could be even worse than the Lucifer heatwave last year."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000407549635.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry meghan markle honeymoon rumours namibia","story":"The couple had been tipped to travel to Namibia thanks to the 33-year-old royals strong ties to southwest Africa.But Prince Harry put the rumour to bed during a chat with Mavis Elias, a philanthropist from Namibia, at the Queens Young Leaders Awards Ceremony on Tuesday, The Mirror reported.The Love Is Charity founder asked Harry if he visited her home country and he responded: No, we didnt go to Namibia.And the royal seemed keen to keep the real destination under wraps.Gesturing to listening media as he added: Im not going to say where.Namibia had been hotly tipped as a possible honeymoon destination for the couple.Harry and Meghan had been expected to stay at the Hoanib Valley Camp in Kaokoland for the romantic getaway after marrying at St Georges Chapel in Windsor Castle.Harry is a big fan of the country - after spending time there with ex-girlfriend Chelsy Davy in 2006, as part of the Army in 2008 and working on conservation projects in 2015.And he also spent a significant length of time in neighbouring Botswana with Meghan, with the couple even celebrating Prince Harrys birthday there.The Sun revealed last year that the couple actually decided to wed while on the romantic holiday in Botswana in 2017.The loved-up pair committed to marriage when they were camping under the stars in the African wilderness, just a year after they started dating.For Meghans first ever safari, the pair stayed in a luxurious tented bush camp at Meno a Kwena, boasting incredible views over the Boteti River and African bush.Harry later said of the trip: Going on holiday together in the middle of nowhere and sharing a tent together and all that kind of stuff.It was fantastic.Harry even sourced the main stone in the engagement ring he gave to Meghan from Botswana, which is one of the world’s most renowned places for diamond mining.The couple may well have still travelled to another part of Africa for their honeymoon.Prince Harry has previously revealed his affinity with Africa - even missing his niece Princess Charlottes christening in order to help with anti-poaching efforts in Namibia.While on his trip he slept outside in the bush, telling one of his colleagues: Ive come all the way to Africa to be free. I’m taking my bedroll and I’m sleeping by the fire.Other possible destinations included Barbados and Tuscany."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416961516.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britain most extravagant school prom somervale midsomer norton pictures","story":"Students celebrating the end of their GCSEs began arriving at Sommervale School in Midsomer Norton, Somerset from 8am this morning.Pupils from younger years and parents crowded around to get a glimpse of the vehicles they arrived in which included a VW camper van nicknamed Mr Happy and a vintage orange Mustang.Other flash motors included a couple of open-top vintage Cadillacs, super-stretch limousines, souped-up muscle cars... and a scooter.Preparations for today’s events which conclude with a meal and disco at a hotel in nearby Bath this evening began as far back as September.Pupil Amber Sims, 16, arrived in the campervan with several girlfriends.She said: Ive been looking forward to it for the past few months.Ive been planning my outfit since the start of Year 11.We wanted something different from a limo so chose a camper van.”Tori Collins, 15, arrived in the camper van with Amber, and said: I got up at 5.30am to do my hair and make-up.We liked the way the camper van looked, and no-one else was doing it.Its good to be different, and it makes you stand out, but its not a competition.Her mother Sarah Collins, 48, said: Weve spent about £250 in total, on the car hire, two dresses, one for the daytime and one for the evening.Some people spent £400 just on a dress.It must be difficult for some parents but they do all seem to manage, some of them arrive in their parents cars which are decorated for the occasion.The prom has been held for the past decade. In previous years pupils at the town’s two secondary schools have tried to upstage each other by arriving in ice cream vans, tractors, mobility scooters - and even a TANK.The prom is used as an incentive by the school, and in order to go, pupils must have good attendance, good behaviour, and attend at least two revision sessions either after school or at lunchtime, per week.Head teacher Jo Postlethwaite said: They have to earn the right to have a prom. They have to have good attendance, good behaviour, and we added in the expectation that they attend extra lessons.It is not a right, its a privilege.They are absolutely gorgeous, Im so proud."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000417004171.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather forecast latest weekend temperatures met office","story":"Families have headed to beaches in droves this week to make the most of the clear blue waters - and the sizzling weather is set to continue for the weekend.Saturday alone could see highs of 29C across the UK and the sizzling conditions show no signs of budging.Met Office senior meteorologist Marco Petagna said: It will certainly be hotter than average weather over the next week or so.But it could be a bit unsettled in the south west of the country, with occasional showers.Britons have enjoyed a blissful week of sun, with this weeks highs the the first time in five years that temperatures have hit 30C in all four nations of the UK.Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: We are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.We will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.But while Brits lap up the sun, the heat has caused chaos.Some roads have begun to melt in the heatwave - sparking warnings for motorists to take care on the roads.Gritters have even been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.Its not only roads impacted by the summer heat.The winter salt-spreaders were called into action as the heatwave softened surface bitumen in areas including  Exmoor and Woodbury Salterton, Devon.Trains were stopped from running over steel tracks near Carlisle as they buckled in the heat on Thursday.Train tracks have reached temperatures 49C, expanding and bending the metal.Trains had to be stopped from running over a section of track near Carlisle station on Thursday.Speed restrictions have been in place all week on the route from London Waterloo to New Malden due to the scorching temperatures, causing delays to services.With no rain on the horizon, the South East is set for its driest June since records began.The last time the area received so little rain was in 1925, recording just 3.4mm.Residents on a housing estate in Highbridge, Somerset, had put up the temporary pool in a play park.But yesterday health and safety officials, flanked by cops, swooped and drained it.Local Sam Ridley-Brown said: “It was not doing any harm and the kids  loved it.”Other measures have been put into place, with the first hosepipe ban likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.United Utilities has also warned there will be a hosepipe ban in North West England from Monday unless the public reduces their usage over the weekend.Households have been asked to cut their use down by 5 to 10 per cent.The hot weather has also sparked fire across parts of Saddleworth Moor this week.A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.The Met Offices heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.Public Health England issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable.The pollen count is also expected to soar this weekend.More than half of the UK is expected to be hit with very high levels of grass pollen.The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires.The heat has already claimed casualties.Thirteen-year-old Ryan Evans tragically drowned while swimming at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, with it taking divers two days to find the youngsters body.A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars.The hot spell is good news for gardeners, with horticultural experts saying it could help produce excellent vegetables, fruit and flowers.The Royal Horticultural Society have suggested people use waste water from the kitchen to keep plants nourished and to reduce demand for water."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000416867276.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may says danny dyer is perfectly entitled to call david cameron a tt and refuses to stand up for ex pm","story":"The PM defended the actors right to call David Cameron a t**t -

No ones got a f**king clue what Brexit is.Its like this mad riddle that no one knows what it is. So whats happened to that t**t David Cameron who called it on?He called all this on, where is he?

Coastal District Council in January shortly after proposing to long-term girlfriend Cherry Seaborn, 26.The singer said the chapel was needed because it is every persons right to be able to have a place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for religious observance, celebration of key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and so forth.But planning officials said the chapel would conflict with prevailing character of the landscape.Sheerans planning agent Paul Smith said such claims were not based on facts and discredit the high-quality architecture.Mr Smith, from Apex Planning Consultants, insisted the chapel would have been sited on private land, at least 230m from the road.He added: We do not agree that at such distance from public land and views, it will generate the attention he (the objector) purports.After The Suffolk Wildlife Trust raised concerns about a colony of endangered Great Crested Newts on the land, Sheeran pledged to carry out an ecological survey.It is not known what plans Mr Sheeran will now have for his wedding.A spokesman for Suffolk Coastal District Council said: It [the chapel] would be out of character for the rural

even at the age of 92","story":"So we shouldn’t be surprised that she had to cancel a service at St Paul’s Cathedral this week because she was feeling a bit “under the weather”.The Queen’s definition of that anodyne phrase is most likely an ailment that would have left the rest of us in hospital.She reminds me of those “stuff and nonsense” posh countrywomen in French And Saunders who would accidentally cut their fingers off and nonchalantly throw them to the dogs.There must, however, have been more to it than Her Maj not ­feeling too chipper, as she hates to miss any special church services, and especially one which marked the 200th anniversary of the Order of Michael and St George.While that might not mean very much to you and me, it’s the kind of historical royal traditional the Queen holds so very dear.Those attending had to make do with Hollywood star Angelina Jolie, being honoured for her international charity work.I’m sure Angelina would have been horribly disappointed not to receive her gong from the Queen, but from last-minute substitute the Duke of Kent.Even A-listers are in awe of our monarch.But maybe her absence from events is something we will all have to get more used to.She has already stepped down from overseas visits, leaving the long-haul flights to younger members of The Firm.Indeed, we’ve just seen Prince William deftly tip-toe through political minefields in the Middle East.And I’m sure Meghan and Harry will have started packing for an upcoming visit to Australia and New Zealand.The Queen, will obviously still be on hand to give wise counsel to her children and grand children, but with Prince Philip retired from public life, who could blame her for taking things a little bit easier.Her schedule is relentless.Earlier in the week she was working as usual, with duties including an audience with the ambassador of Zimbabwe.Next week she will be at Holyrood Palace, in ­Edinburgh, with a busy schedule of events including investitures where she will, among others, be honouring my friend and colleague Ross King with an MBE.At these ceremonies the Queen is on her feet for hours, dealing with nervous, excited people including those like myself, who are so overcome they just blub and burble incoherently.To this day I have no idea what the Queen said to me when I received my OBE in Holyrood, because I was so overcome by the whole experience.Even those who profess to find the Royal Family archaic and irrelevant would have to admit the Queen deserves respect for her work ethic and sense of duty. Despite being in her nineties, she has kept her finger on the nation’s pulse and apart from the blip immediately after Diana’s death, she knows what the people expect of her.That’s why I don’t think we will ever see her completely retire.She keeps a beady eye on the other royals and I reckon she will take a very dim view of this week’s revelations that Prince Charles ran up a £1million bill jetting around in the past financial year.The Queen switches off the lights in Buckingham Palace, keeps leftovers in Tupperware boxes and famously turns the heating down even in the depths of a freezing Balmoral winter.The costs run up by Charles and Camilla (including an eye-watering £362,000 to charter a plane on a visit to the Far East last year) are just the sort of excesses his mother frowns upon.And they will make her determined not to hand over the reins to her eldest son while she still has breath in her body. CORRIE will be a duller show without the luminous Catherine Tyldesley, who has filmed her final scenes as poor Eva.We all knew Catherine was a cracking comic turn, but over the past few months Eva’s storyline has gone to some very dark places indeed.And Catherine more than proved her skill as a ­dramatic actress, right up there with the best of them.I reckon she could easily gain the kind of success enjoyed by Corrie alumini such as Sarah ­Lancashire, Suranne Jones and Katherine Kelly.Like them, Catherine is a truly authentic performer, and she has already made the bold move of ­ changing her hair colour to distance ­herself from Eva and to show the world she means business.I wish her all the very best.She’s a lovely woman who truly deserves success and she has proved again that most of the top acting on our screens comes from the once-derided soaps. VERY sad to hear that Johnny Depp’s teenage son Jack is suffering from what is being described as “serious health problems”.His mum Vanessa Paradis missed the Paris premiere of her latest movie to stay with the 16-year-old.The couple never got married but they were together for 14 years until they split in 2012. Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The online casino also hosts six different variants of Monopoly for players to try."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tp-image-cartoon.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm theresa may retreats to country bolthole chequers to thrash out brexit plan with cabinet","story":"For on Friday, Theresa May is summoning the entire Cabinet to Chequers, her country retreat, to thrash this out.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over at a Chequers meetingThis meeting is taking place far too late. Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin.

Last week, YouTube personalities Paul Joseph Watson, Sargon of Akkad, Count Dankula and former tech blogger Milo Yiannopoulos announced they were joining the ailing party. And the party has welcomed their new members, who prefer to label themselves ‘classical liberals’ or ’radical centrists’ rather than ‘alt-right’. What unites them is a fundamentalist, almost fanatical defence of ‘freedom of speech’. In practice, that often means the freedom to say whatever they want and attack whomever they please, however they please to their enormous and engaged social media following, without consideration or consequence. Ukip has welcomed them with open arms, and their arrival is likely to inject a new and different energy into the party, which has teetered on the brink of irrelevance since the Brexit referendum. But could they make Ukip dangerous again? How did this happen?  Party leader Gerard Batten signalled a shift in Ukip’s priorities earlier this year, by publicly supporting Tommy Robinson and speaking alongside the EDL founder at a ‘free speech’ march earlier this year. As a former EDL member, Robinson, who is currently in prison, is banned from joining Ukip for life. Who are the new faces? Count Dankula  Earlier this month , Mark Meechan, better known as Count Dankula told his Twitter followers he would join Ukip if they retweeted him 10,000 times. They did and he did. Meechan was successfully prosecuted for publishing a video in which he appeared to teach his girlfriend\u0027s pug to do a nazi salute every time he said \u0027gass the Jews\u0027. He is also a vocal supporter of Tommy Robinson.  Paul Joseph Watson   Watson was next. He is ‘editor-at-large’ at conspiracy theory website InfoWars, which has repeatedly claimed the Sandy Hook massacre may have been faked by the government. And he has regularly told “the truth about Islam” , complained about “social justice warriors” and immigration and made unfounded claims about Hillary Clinton’s health to the 875,000 followers on his @PrisonPlanet Twitter account. Sargon of Akkad  Around the same time, Carl Benjamin, AKA Sargon of Akkad, paid his \u0026pound30 membership fee. Benjamin is a YouTube shouter, who has described Harvey Weinstein’s victims as “gold digging whores” and defended Elliot Rodger as a “poor f**king guy” who had no option” but to murder six people because of feminism.  And finally, Milo Yiannopoulos joined the gang. Yiannopoulos is under fire today after telling a reporter he couldn’t wait for “vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down”, days before five people, including journalists were gunned down in a Maryland newsroom.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

Glamorous boys and girls began arriving from 8am this morning in an array of vehicles and outfits as hundreds of residents lined the streets to watch. And while most students wear one dress for their prom, many here opt for two - one for the day and another for the evening meal and disco. Some even woke up at the crack of dawn to get their hair and makeup professionally done, and the event is considered bigger than a lot of people\u0027s weddings. Colourful pictures show high-spirited GCSE pupils arriving at their big day in a spectacular line of vintage cars.  The elaborate displays were put on by 15 and 16-year-old pupils at Somervale School, Midsomer Norton, Somerset. It is a small town which has built a reputation for its no-expense-spared school proms. In previous years pupils at the two secondary schools have tried to upstage each other by arriving in ice cream vans, tractors, mobility scooters - and even a TANK. This year, the most unusual included a VW camper van nicknamed ‘Mr Happy’ and a vintage orange Mustang. Preparations begin in September for the annual occasion, which started at 8am on Friday morning with pupils from the younger years and parents crowding around to watch the procession.  Students flocked to the school dressed in glamorous attire, before leaving at noon to get ready for their evening meal and disco at the Hilton Hotel in Bath, Somerset. The GCSE leavers have been partaking in the prom for more than ten years, and imaginative forms of transport - including some pupils arriving in a boat pulled on a trailer one year - have set a high standard. Staff member Karen Pullman said: “It’s as elaborate as a wedding, with the daytime and evening outfits worn by the girls.” This year pupils arrived in two open top vintage Cadillacs, an orange Mustang, and a VW campervan decked out with ribbons. Pupil Amber Sims, 16, arrived in the campervan with several girlfriends. She said: “I’ve been looking forward to it for the past few months.  “I’ve been planning my outfit since the start of Year 11. “We wanted something different from a limo so chose a camper van. “It was exciting having everyone watching when we arrived.” Her mother Lisa Sims, 44, added: “My son is 18 and went to his prom in a kit car, with his dad dressed as the Stig. “Amber’s organised all of it with her pals, they’re a really good group of friends. “It can be very expensive. We’ve spent about \u0026pound150 on it but some of her friends have spent more on just the dress.”  She doubted her daughter would wear her pink jewelled gown again. Mrs Sims, a mother-of-three, added: “They all look amazing.” The event can can cost an eye-watering amount for parents who foot the bill, including for dresses costing more than \u0026pound400. Tori Collins, 15, arrived in the camper van with Amber, and said: “I got up at 5.30am to do my hair and make-up. “We liked the way the camper van looked, and no-one else was doing it. “It’s good to be different, and it makes you stand out, but it’s not a competition.”  Her mother Sarah Collins, 48, said: “We’ve spent about \u0026pound250 in total, on the car hire, two dresses, one for the daytime and one for the evening. “Then there’s two pairs of shoes, two handbags, getting her nails done, and the evening meal. “That’s with a relatively conservative amount on the dress, which cost \u0026pound25. “Some people spent \u0026pound400 just on a dress. “It must be difficult for some parents but they do all seem to manage, some of them arrive in their parents cars which are decorated for the occasion.”  She added that her son arrived at his prom on a space hopper two years ago. Joe MacLachlan, 16, arrived in a limousine with eight friends, all boys. He said: “We went for a drive around the local area before arriving at school, it was fun, we had music on and just relaxed. “It’s a bit strange seeing everyone in suits.” Nathan Rogers, 16, arrived in a 1965 Cadillac with five friends, also all male. “I think prom is bigged up in America but here it’s a nice thing when you’ve finished exams,” he said. “It gives you something to look forward to.  “Boys tend to go with boys, and girls tend to go with girls. “I think parents see it as a reward for all the hard work with GCSEs.” The prom used as an incentive by the school, and in order to go, pupils must have good attendance, good behaviour, and attend at least two revision sessions either after school or at lunchtime, per week. Of the 85 pupils in Year 11, 60 went to the prom and only a small number were excluded. Others chose not to go, and of the 60 who did, not all were attending the evening event.

Queen Victoria, King George V and Queen Mary are among the royals who feature in a stunning set of photos which were originally black and white.  A young Princess Margaret , the Queen Mother and Prince Edward as a toddler are also among the newly-colourised pictures.  The images were painstakingly produced by Nicola Branson, from Wellingborough in Northamptonshire. The 47-year-old was initially planning simply to share the pictures on her Instagram page.  She said: I decided to look at the Royals for colouring as a private project originally that I was going to share on my Instagram account, but a few close friends who have seen me working on these photos suggested they were amazed how they looked more like a colour photo rather than a coloured photo. The Royals through their generations have all been very photogenic and my personal favourite is the Queen Mother. My dad, a few months before he died, said to me \u0027what\u0027s the point of having all these photos when now you can keep them on your phone or PC?\u0027 My response was that they are all memories dad, and memories can live forever.  Through today\u0027s technology old photos can be restored and colour added, those people can have pride of place in a photo frame. The British royal family comprises Queen Elizabeth II and her close relations. There is no strict legal or formal definition of who is or is not a member of the British royal family.  Since 1917, when King George V changed the name of the royal house from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, members of the royal family belong, either by birth or by marriage, to the House of Windsor. Nicola, who used Adobe Photoshop to restore and instil colour into the photos, explained how she became interested in the quirky hobby. I started restoring and colourising old photos by my interest in genealogy, she said. When my dad died I started looking at the old photos that had been passed down from my grandparents.

Roads have melted and train tracks have reached 49C (120.2F) as the prolonged hot spell continues into the weekend with almost no end in sight.  The first hosepipe ban began in Northern Ireland at 6pm on Friday, with plenty more hot sunshine forecast for the coming days. Northern Ireland Water said demand was outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water. Elsewhere across the UK consumers are being urged to take simple steps to reduce the amount of water they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden. NI Water chief executive Sara Venning said: We have maximised our water production and need customers\u0027 help to reduce demand. We are asking customers to take heed of the hosepipe ban and stop non-essential water use - using hoses and sprinklers is causing demand to exceed the capacity to supply. According to the latest information from the Met Office, the highest temperature on Friday was 32.5C (90.5F) in Porthmadog in Wales. The mercury hit 30.1C (86.2F) in Castlederg in Northern Ireland, 29.4C (84.9F) in Bridgefoot in England, and 28.4C (83.1F) in Threave, Scotland.  Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said temperatures may be slightly lower over the weekend, but will widely be in the balmy mid to high twenties. Britons enjoyed the hottest temperature of the year for the fourth day in a row on Thursday as the mercury soared to 33C (91.4F) once again in Porthmadog in Wales. While temperatures appear to have peaked for now, they will remain high into the weekend and early next week. Saturday could see highs of 29C (84.2F) in England and Scotland, 27C (80.6F) in Northern Ireland and Wales, and predicted highs of around 31C (87.8F) in some parts of the UK by Monday. Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles. Some railway track soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend. Trains had to be stopped from running over a section of track near Carlisle station on Thursday. Speed restrictions have been in place all week on the route from London Waterloo to New Malden due to the scorching temperatures, causing delays to services. Translink Rail services also felt the heat as they were forced to delay and cancel services across Northern Ireland on Thursday as rail lines reached over 50C and began to buckle.  The Met Office \u0027s heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.   This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said. Public Health England issued a warning saying the extreme heat may pose a risk to the most vulnerable. The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires. The heat has already claimed casualties. The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water. They said: We just cannot emphasis enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned. Our message is simple, please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation. It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening. The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday. The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard. There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days. Mr Madge said: There is a low probability of showers on Sunday. If they do bring some rainfall it would be in the South West but that will be very sporadic. Parts of Saddleworth Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.

But why is the London Tube so hot and why doesn\u0027t it have air con? While most of the older underground lines are hot, the Central line is by far the worst with temperatures often exceeding the EU limit at which it\u0027s legal to transport livestock. This week the Evening Standard reported how commuters on the red line endured 34.5C heat. But despite the record temperatures it doesn\u0027t look like this will change any time soon as it would major investment from Transport for London to cool it down.   Wired reports that the Central line consistently breaks records with temperatures peaking at 35.5C last summer.  This exceeds the EU limit of 30C at which it is legal to transport cows, sheep and pigs. These red hot temperatures on the crimson line are nothing new with peaks of 30C in July and August 2013, 30.5C in July 2014, 31.04C in August 2016. The only other line to reach such temperatures in the Bakerloo line with 30.91C recorded in September 2016. But it\u0027s almost impossible for TfL to cool down the Central line as it\u0027s just so old.  When engineers built the tube tunnels back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they left no extra space and so there isn\u0027t enough room to install air conditioning units because there\u0027s nowhere for the hot air to escape. As well as this, the clay surrounding the deep running line locks in all the heat. And that clay has been constantly heating up thanks to more people, more trains and more buildings and now measures between 20C and 25C. The Central Line also has much less air shafts compared to other lines and there is little chance of them being installed at this stage as the deep running lines go under some of the most densely populated parts of the city. As well as this, 38 per cent of the heat generated on the tube is from trains breaking and the Central does this more frequently as it is one of the fastest lines and covers 49 stations over 46 miles.  TfL\u0027s only way of cooling down the line is on a station-to-station basis where the introduce fan cooling systems that pull fresh air from the street, cool it and then pump it down to the platform. These are in operation at St Paul\u0027s, Victoria station, Oxford Circus and Green Park. TfL aims to have air conditioned trains coming into operation on the deep underground lines by 2030. A spokeswoman told : We completely understand that travelling can be uncomfortable during periods of hot weather and are investing millions of pounds to make the Tube and buses cooler for customers.  We are constantly working on new ways to keep the temperature down on the Tube and have doubled the number of fans on the network since 2012 as well as installing chiller units to pump in cold air.   There are also 192 air conditioned trains serving 40 per cent of the network. All of our buses have opening windows and all new double-deck buses use air cooling systems.  During this hot weather we advise customers to ensure they have water with them when they travel in order to stay hydrated.”  Meanwhile, the Evening Standard reported on the scorching temperatures on London\u0027s buses with temperatures as hot as pizza ovens.  Those travelling on the top deck of buses faced similar temperatures to the Central Line with highs of 34C. Viliana Rankova, 28, told the newspaper that her commute was “like hell”.

Smitten Gary Guest met his “princess” Marie in a bar in Albufeira in Portugal during a lads’ holiday and told her: You can be my Vicky Pattison after buying her drink. But he failed to get her number and when he returned home to Nottingham he couldn’t think of anything else but her. Armed with the only information he had - her first name and that she was from the North East - he tried to find her on social media. Unable to search through the thousands of Maries, he asked his local paper Chronicle Live to play Cupid and put out his plea for the correct Marie to step forward.  And within hours of our story going live, Gary was put in touch with the woman of his dreams - Marie Donnelly from Gateshead. “Obviously I was really, really shocked but proper flattered,” said Marie, 29, who works in public relations - and is single. “Two of my friends, who I was on holiday with in Albufeira, are in Ibiza at the minute and they saw the story online over there. One of the girls tagged me in and said ‘that is 100% you he is looking for’.”  She added: “When the story popped up on Facebook my heart was pounding, it is a lovely thing for him to do.” Gary was sitting in Sir Harry’s bar in the Old Town Square with his friends on Tuesday, June 19, at around 11pm when Marie walked in. The 42-year-old couldn’t take his eyes off her and asked to buy her a drink via the bar waitress. Gary then took the drink over to her and said ‘that is for a beautiful princess’.  Marie then thanked him and kissed him on the cheek. The guys asked her name and she told them she was Marie from the North East. Gary said ‘you can be my Vicky Pattison’ and she said ‘I CAN be your Vicky Pattison’. Marie sat back down and then, about 10 minutes later the women got up from their table and left. Gary jumped up to give her one last kiss on the cheek and Marie walked away into the distance. Gary told Chronicle Live : “Like a fool, I let her go.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum says seven goodbyes dying","story":"NewsMum says SEVEN goodbyes to dying daughter as she wakes up screaming from drug-induced \u0027final sleep\u0027EXCLUSIVE: Mum Susan Strong is campaigning for compassionate euthanasia after her \"stoic\" daughter Fiona, 31, died in a hospice last month - she says: \"If she was well enough I\u0027d have taken her to Dignitas\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySophie Evans14:41, 29 JUN 2018Updated07:16, 30 JUN 2018NewsSusan Strong is pictured with her stoic daughter Fiona, 28, who took her final breaths in a hospice last month (Image: Mirrorpix)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSitting in a hospice room, Susan Strong took her dying daughter Fiona\u0027s hand and told her everything she needed to in a final, heartbreaking goodbye. It was a devastating moment for both mum and daughter as Fiona prepared to fall into a deep drug-induced sleep from which she expected to never wake. The terminally ill 31-year-old had bravely opted for medication to relieve her agonising pain that she knew, as a side effect, would result in sedation. Determined to not be a vegetable after cancer snatched away her ability to move, eat or drink, she had told her mum: \u0027I really want to die with dignity. But devastatingly, Fiona did not get her wish. Instead of \u0027sleeping\u0027 peacefully until she took her final breaths, as hoped, she woke up just 20 minutes later. And for the next four days, she continued to wake. Confused and scared, she would scream out in pain as her loved ones and doting nurses tried to comfort her.  Each time, Susan would say another \u0027last goodbye\u0027 to her daughter, who had told medics she did not want to be fed or watered while receiving end-of-life care. But it was only after SEVEN, gut-wrenching farewells that Fiona eventually died at The Margaret Centre at Whipps Cross Hospital in east London on May 1. Now, weeks on from her death, her mum is campaigning for assisted dying - and insists she would have helped her daughter to end her own life, if possible. We must have said our goodbyes six or seven times until she finally passed away, said Susan, who described Fiona\u0027s treatment as \u0027terminal sedation\u0027. She underwent five days of continual waking and pain. Every time she fell asleep, we thought that would be it. It would be very upsetting - then she\u0027d wake up again. At one point, she woke up and was thirsty. I gave her a drink and she said. \u0027Mum, stop trying to keep me alive.\u0027 It was scary for her as well. It\u0027s not what she wanted. It was torturous.  She added: It was more difficult [for Fiona] because she was having to say goodbyes to everybody again and again and again. There was no peace of mind. Even the nurses and doctors at the hospice were in distress as there was nothing further they could do to ease her suffering. Continuous deep sedation, often labelled \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 or \u0027palliative sedation\u0027 by relatives, has been used for decades to relieve the suffering of the terminally ill. The hospice says while it increased Fiona\u0027s sedation to relieve her agitation as safely as it could, she did experience some consciousness in her final days. Although the young woman was not given food or liquid at this time, in accordance with her wishes, her mouth and lips were kept moist by hospice nurses. She was also given medication to relieve her unbearable pain. But despite medics\u0027 best efforts to care for her at the facility in Leytonstone, they could not stop her excruciating suffering - because of the law, her mum said.  [The doctors] didn\u0027t use the words \u0027terminal sedation\u0027 said Susan, who was joined at the hospice by Fiona\u0027s dad, Clive Strong, and devoted boyfriend, Alex Paxton. She claimed: They said to Fi, \u0027We could sedate you and you wouldn\u0027t wake up after about four hours and eventually just stay asleep.\u0027 The mum-of-two, 61, is now fighting for compassionate euthanasia in a bid to prevent hundreds of others from going through the same ordeal Fiona did. If she was well enough I\u0027d have taken her to Dignitas in Switzerland, she said. She was screaming out all the time, even with all that pain relief. It was just awful. All she wanted to do was keep her dignity in tact and be pain-free. We would not allow an animal to suffer like this. She added: Fiona was so stoic and brave but how she died was so unnecessary. Assisted dying is illegal in the UK, but a Mirror poll this week found three out of four Brits would support a law change to allow it. They want people with a terminal illness who have six months or less to live to be given the right to decide when they die.  Fiona was first diagnosed with the rare and aggressive childhood cancer rhabdomyosarcoma - a type of soft tissue sarcoma - in October 2015. She had been complaining of headaches, a numb face and nausea for weeks, but it was only after her eye began protruding that a tumour was discovered in her paranasal sinuses. They told her it was a tumour and to prepare for cancer, Susan added. They had to do a biopsy to test whether it was the disease. After undergoing a biopsy at St George\u0027s Hospital in Tooting, south London, Fiona, then 28, returned to her Leytonstone home, where she was constantly sick. It was the tumour pressing on her brain causing her to be sick, her mum explained. We didn\u0027t sleep all night. As the sickness grew worse, Fiona ended up being admitted to hospital, where she was later told the news she and her family had feared.  The consultant came in and said, \u0027Unfortunately, it\u0027s a very rare type of cancer. It usually affects children but is very unusual in adults\u0027, Susan said. I was in bits, I was devastated. Fiona, who worked for a market research company, was told the tumour was in an awkward position, located in the bone and sinus behind her right eye. For the next 14 months, she underwent treatment at The Royal Marsden Hospital in Chelsea, including gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She suffered facial paralysis and spent her 29th birthday in intensive care battling sepsis - but faced it all with humour, dignity and incredible courage. Fiona gave the disease the respect it deserved but she didnt let it define her. She didn\u0027t want to be the person who was talking about her illness, Susan said. Despite her own struggles, Fiona also went out of her way to help others, raising more than \u0026pound10,000 for cancer charities and donating her brunette hair to the Little Princess Trust. And in January 2017, she was given something she had dreamed of - the all-clear.  But tragically, after only four months of remission, her eye started playing up again and doctors told her that a new cancerous tumour had been found. Despite undergoing further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, a clinical trial and even surgery to remove her eye at Moorfields Eye Hospital, the disease spread. Before long, Fiona\u0027s tumour had invaded both her brain and her nose, making it difficult for her to breathe - with the cancer also in her neck, shoulder and spine. A nurse was coming to the house to give her pain relief, Susan said. They said, \u0027I think we should get her to a hospice\u0027. In constant pain, Fiona was admitted to The Margaret Centre on April 9, where she was joined by mostly elderly patients and a team of compassionate nurses. She was on so many drugs, but they still couldn\u0027t control the pain, Susan said. She said to me, \u0027I\u0027m going to give it till April 27. If I don\u0027t feel any better, I want you to help me end my life. Take me to Switzerland or something\u0027. Before her admission, Fiona\u0027s loved ones had begun raising more than \u0026pound100,000 for immunotherapy treatment which would have started later that month.  They raised a whopping \u0026pound43,000 of their target, and despite her rapidly deteriorating condition, the young woman vowed to give it one last shot. Fiona said, \u0027even if immunotherapy gives me a few weeks extra\u0027, Susan said. She had a network of friends who were absolutely incredible. But unfortunately, Fiona, who loved scuba diving, travelling and socialising with pals, never got the chance to undergo immunotherapy. To her and her family\u0027s horror, her cancer was growing too quickly. She had lost all mobility in her legs, couldn\u0027t walk, could partially move her neck... the tumour was growing so much it had grown into her neck, her mum said. Her tongue was swollen so she was finding it difficult to speak and eat. In late April, doctors asked Fiona what she wanted to happen. She said, \u0027I really want to die with dignity\u0027, I don\u0027t want to be a vegetable where I can\u0027t speak. I can\u0027t move and I\u0027ve got no quality of life,\u0027 Susan said.  Fiona was told she could undergo end-of-life treatment to relieve her distress which, as a side effect, would cause her to fall into a \u0027deep sleep\u0027, according to her mum. She said that\u0027s what she wanted, she said. The young woman agreed to the treatment - involving syringe drivers and no food or water - which she hoped would leave her sedated until her eventual death. We all sat around her bed and said our goodbyes. We thought that that was going to be it. But it never happened... she kept waking up, Susan said. In some ways it was alarming because we were pleased she\u0027d woken up selfishlessly. It was like a rollercoaster. She claimed that even the doctors and nurses were left stunned. Fiona would say something poignant about us all, it was quite distressing, said Susan, who is divorced from her daughter\u0027s dad and now with partner Steve, 62. We\u0027d think \u0027well that\u0027s it\u0027. And then she\u0027d wake up. The nurses were in tears. In her final hours, Fiona\u0027s breathing became laboured and she started suffering from blood clots in her mouth, which caused her to gurgle.  The nurses had to use a suction pump to take them out, her mum said. She added: She then started making a noise as if she was calling me but couldn\u0027t speak. I got up and held her hand. She couldn\u0027t talk but she was aware I was there. The nurse said her breathing was getting shallower. Soon after, the young woman took her last breaths. She finally passed away on the Tuesday morning, said Susan, who moved down South from her home in Fife, Scotland, to care for Fiona. At the end of the day I didn\u0027t want to lose Fiona,but I didn\u0027t want her to be in pain. She definitely should\u0027ve been allowed to end her own life. It wasn\u0027t what we imagined at all. She added she was pleased with the results from the Mirror poll on assisted dying. I think there should be a nationwide poll for it, she said. Patients have got a responsibility to themselves. Ultimately, it\u0027s your body. She continued:  People are still going to die at the end of the day. In this day and age, we have to be more open-minded about death.  Addressing concerns about relaxing euthanasia rules, the mum said she believes patients should have to sign a detailed document about their treatment. We shouldn\u0027t be a passive patient, said Susan, who is currently staying at a friend\u0027s house, as she sorts out Fiona\u0027s belongings and flat. You\u0027d have to be aware of what you were getting, it would need to be open. There could even be a medical card, like there has been with organ donation. She added:Fiona\u0027s quality of life had diminished drastically by the end. There does have to be a degree of dignity. We can keep people alive but it\u0027s wrong to keep them alive if they are suffering things so great. I wouldn\u0027t want my worst enemy to go through what Fiona went through. Critics have said relaxing assisted dying laws would put pressure on vulnerable people to end their lives out of fear of being a financial, emotional and care burden. However, campaign organisation Dignity in Dying says terminally ill adults such as Fiona should have the right to die on their own terms. A spokesman told the Mirror: “Nobody deserves to die in pain, suffering and without dignity. For most people, palliative care is excellent and will be able to give the vast majority of us a good death.

Stephen Gee crept into his neighbour\u0027s garden armed with a bladed weapon which he used to slash a hole in the metal wall of the pool, causing 4,000 litres of water to gush out. The 63-year-old had become fed up with the noise made by Jason Little\u0027s children when using the 10m long pool.  So the retired aircraft engineer staged a nighttime raid to sabotage it - and was caught in CCTV footage.  Mr Little, a decorated army major, and his wife Avril were away at the time and when they returned to their \u0026pound600,000 home they found their pool empty and their garden flooded. When Mr Little reviewed the video from his hidden CCTV camera, he found footage of his hooded neighbour taken at 4.30am, tiptoeing up his garden path, past his herbaceous border and towards his pool. Gee disappeared behind the structure for 16 seconds before re-emerging and sneaking back to his house.  Although Gee had left a note in the Littles\u0027 porch explaining how he had woken in the night to the sound of flowing water and found their garden flooded, Mr Little called the police. A court heard that the attack was the culmination of a four year dispute between the neighbours over the noise made when the Littles\u0027 children used the pool. Mr Little, who won the Military Cross for displaying inspirational leadership in battle in Afghanistan in 2008, had moved into a large detached house in the Dorset village of Puxey in 2012 with his family. Although the oval swimming pool, which measured 10m by 4m, was already installed, his new neighbours soon took offence to his children using it. Mr Little, 46, told the court: The pool was already there when we moved in and we started using it. Almost immediately they seemed to take offence to the fact we have children and the children make noise. Whenever they used the swimming pool, they shouted over the fence at them and would play loud music and stare at them. Before we had CCTV things happened to the swimming pool that I couldn\u0027t explain, so we had cameras installed to the rear of the property.  Mr Little said they hadn\u0027t used the pool that summer of 2016 but he had carried out maintenance and checks so the children could start using it again. He checked the pool before he left to go away on the weekend of June 19, 2016 and the water level was full and there was no leak. The CCTV camera hidden on a conservatory to cover the back garden showed Gee stood behind the pool for 16 seconds before leaving the garden. PC Charlotte Goddard told Poole Magistrates\u0027 Court it looked like the wall of the pool had been hit hard with something heavy and the cut was wider at one end, like an axe blade or similar had hit it. She said that in the CCTV footage it looked like Gee was carrying something heavy in his right hand as he approached the pool, although it is not clear what. The cost of the damage ran to \u0026pound1,500, although Mr Little said he claimed it through his house insurance and only had to pay the \u0026pound250 excess. Gee, who worked in the aviation industry for 25 years, pleaded not guilty to criminal damage.

Now from 1 July, the fee that banks pay ATM operators per withdrawal is being reduced - and it is expected more will close or will start charging customers a fee. Link, the shared network of ATMs in the UK, is to cut the fees operators receive from banks when the cashpoints are used. The fee – known as the interchange rate - is currently around 25p and will be reduced by around 1p with the first cut. It will eventually fall to 20p. While this might not seem like much, operators have stated that some machines will no longer be financially viable to run. So this will mean more and more consumers will be charged to get cash out.  Link said the effect was expected to be a modest decline in the number of ATMs in areas where they are heavily concentrated but with no diminution in the overall geographical coverage. This will be reviewed annually. Which?\u0027s study found that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation found that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK. Which? said such closures would hit rural communities especially hard at a time when bank branch closures were also gaining pace. It said the closures accelerated as operators began to learn of the plans from Link. It has called on the regulator to urgently intervene and halt the cuts until a thorough analysis of the impact on communities is conducted.

Just where did the newly-weds jet off on their secret two-week honeymoon? Some experts have been hedging their bets on the southern African country of Namibia as the destination of choice. Speculation had also been been rife about Jasper Lake in Canada, due to the fact the country has a special place in Meghan\u0027s heart because she lived in Toronto. Other hotly-tipped contenders were Italy, Jamaica and the Caribbean.  And Botswana in Africa was another in the running as the prince has often spoken about his love for Africa, a place he regularly visits as part of his role as patron of a rhino conservation. It\u0027s where the couple also enjoyed a romantic break last year for Meghan\u0027s 36th birthday. But this week, Prince Harry set the record straight (sort of) when asked about the mystery destination. During post-award drinks, following the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders Awards Ceremony on Tuesday, he was asked by Mavis Elias , a philanthropist from Namibia, if she went to her country for his honeymoon.  And in just six words, he quashed the rumour and said: No, we didn\u0027t go to Namibia. The 33-year-old added, gesturing to the media listening: I\u0027m not going to say where. So looks like the destination is going to stay shrouded in mystery, but at least we can narrow the list down. What we do know is Prince William and Kate Middleton\u0027s honeymoon location was ultimately revealed to be the Seychelles. Prince Charles and Princess Diana went to Scotland before embarking on a 12-day cruise through the Greek Islands to Egypt on the Royal Yacht.

The 19-year-old, who goes by the name of Gracelyn White, dates older, married men for money. Her dates range from handsome, wealthy, CEOs in their 30s to \u0027old, fat and disgusting\u0027 men who she claims push her for sexual favours or try to cajole her into threesomes with other girls. Men have tried to invite Gracelyn away on holidays in the south of France, gifted her Christian Louboutin shoes and paid her \u0026pound300 just to have tea with them, she says. And she has now revealed to Mirror that a simple bar of soap - carried by your lover in a bag to work - could be the tell-tale sign that they are having an affair. Gracelyn said: One man told me that he\u0027s always careful not to use the soap in a hotel when he showers after having sex with someone other than his wife so that she cannot smell a foreign scent when he gets home. I\u0027m not sure if he brings his own soap or if he just uses water but carrying soap could indicate that your husband is sleeping with other people, she said. To catch a cheater, Gracelyn also advised that women scrutinise their husband\u0027s finances which could unearth a sugar baby affair or pay a surprise afternoon visit to your partner as lunchtime is her married benefactors\u0027 preferred time for an illicit meeting.  Track their money and check if they are bringing extra clothes to work with them because they sometimes tell me that they changed before our date. Or surprise your husband at lunch time, because married men usually wanted to meet at lunch time. Also, most men pay me in envelopes, so if you find an envelope at home or in the car that should not be there, that could be a sign that he is cheating. Checking their online activity is also a good way of confirming any suspicions, she said. If I was a wife and my husband was making a lot of money, and if I had a thought that he might be cheating on me, I would make a fake profile of a young girl to check if he is on the site, she said. Gracelyn claims that she has been offered \u0026pound4,000 to have sex with her \u0027dates\u0027 but said she is a virgin and is saving herself for her future true love. She said that a need for money drove her to dating for cash.  She explained: I left school when I was 16. My mum had cancer and I thought we needed money to help her through chemotherapy so I got a full-time job. By the time I was 18 I was tired. I did not want to work and I thought there must be more to life. I heard about \u0027sugar baby\u0027 sites, where men pay to spend time with younger women in exchange for money, gifts and a luxurious lifestyle and I thought this sounded like easy money. I didn\u0027t realise at the time that they also expect sex. When I had my first \u0027sugar date\u0027 with a sugar daddy, I understood what it really meant and there was no way I was not going to sleep with them so my idea of being a sugar baby did not work out. Instead I found a site which was full of interesting people. Men would send you an offer to take you out on a date. Usually, the offer is \u0026pound100 but sometimes they pay a lot more. I have been paid \u0026pound300 for a date. And that was just a date, without kissing or anything else. So I started dating rich men for money. Gracelyn, who lives in London, said that the men she dates are all very different but the one common denominator between almost all of them is that they are married.  And sometimes her \u0027dates\u0027 get verbally abusive when she refuses their suggestions of \u0027arrangements\u0027 - sugar baby code for sex. The men I met through the site were looking for escort girls or sugar babies, although this site was meant to be a dating site. I would tell them that the first date was to get to know each other and, if we got along, then on future dates we could think about arrangements. I set rules that they can\u0027t even touch me on the first date but they would still ask me over and over for sex which was annoying. I usually block them after the first date, but if they behaved well I would sometimes allow a second date as well. There was this one man, we had interesting conversations and he behaved well so I agreed to a second date. But when I told him there would still be no touching he texted me and said \u0027I was a gentleman...I thought that would impress you enough for you to consider having a sexy date with me?\u0027 Well, he was fat and old, so that was a disgusting message. We did not have the second date. Another man asked me if I would have a second date and said he could bring a girl with him, that I might be attracted to. That was so funny because he seemed to be the most boring person in the universe, I would never think that he was planning threesomes with young girls.  Despite the inherent dangers of meeting strangers who are looking for sex, Gracelyn said that she has not been physically attacked but she is careful to always meet in a public place and to sit opposite - and never next to her dates - so that they cannot easily touch her. I feel a bit disgusting about what I\u0027m doing. Sometimes I want to text the men beforehand to cancel but I need the money.  But it\u0027s given me material to write a book , which I hope will sell so that I can promote another book I wrote, called \u0027My Lifetime Book\u0027.  I\u0027m actually really innocent and I believe in romance and true love. I\u0027ve never had a boyfriend - I\u0027ve never even kissed a boy on the mouth before. The most I have done is hugged someone on a date because I think that\u0027s just polite. I had one date who was 19 or 20. He was a student spending his parents money. But usually the men range from their 30s to their 60s and most of them are in their 40s. One man had a daughter who was 20. She was older than I was. On the first date, he was telling me about his daughter and I started to mention that she was older then me, and that was so awkward. He really did not want to hear that. There was this other old person who was asking me to meet his other sugar babies, and one of them was in her 30s, so that was weird. What did he expect for us to do together? Gracelyn says her experience has shown her that some old men with money are disgusting explaining: You say no to them and they still ask for sexual favours. And overall the married men were disgusting, some of them would tell me that the wife is home with their kids. I would think \u0027you should be home, helping your wife look after the kids, not be on a date with some young girl\u0027. But I am not a home wrecker. I would have this one date with the married people because they would not get what they wanted from me, like sex, but I would take their money, so I was a winner. I was a bad experience because I was a waste of their time and money so maybe after me they would quit the site. People might think that it is bad that I was dating married men. Well, I don\u0027t think so, because if it was not me, it would be someone else. And for wives who will be reading this, maybe after this story, you might be more careful of what your husband is really doing. The people on the site usually were rich businessmen or lawyers but some people weren\u0027t rich and they would try to negotiate the price which is strange because there are lots of free dating sites.  The book, I Took Your Desperate Dad\u0027s and Husband\u0027s Money is available on Amazon here .  Track your husband\u0027s finances. Affairs can be expensive and there is almost always a money trail.  Pay a surprise visit to your husband at lunctime. Married men arrange many of their \u0027dates\u0027 during their lunch break.  Make a fake online profile and check for your husband on dating sites. Watch out for empty envelopes. The majority of men pay Gracelyn in envelopes so if you find an envelope at home or in the car it could be a warning sign. Check if your husband is bringing extra clothes to work. Gracelyn\u0027s dates sometimes change before they meet her.  Does your husband bring a wash-bag or soap to work? Gracelyn said that some of her dates are very careful not use hotel soap after \u0027arrangements\u0027 with other girls.

Salih Altun, 25, and Sali Amet, 23, and Omer Engin, 24, preyed upon the university student in a sickening ordeal in a city centre. Chilling CCTV captured Altun and Amet leave the nightclub with the 19-year-old, before taking her to their car during the early hours of Friday April 13. Engin joined the yobs moments later and the trio subjected the woman to the degrading assault, which lasted nearly one hour.  But today, the monsters were each jailed for nine years at Canterbury Crown Court. Altun was caged for nine years and nine months while Amet and Engin were each sentenced to nine years in prison. The court heard police trawled through CCTV in a large-scale operation to track the yobs after the attack in Canterbury, Kent. The teenage victim had enjoyed a night out with friends. She was dumped on a street after the rape.  Detective sergeant Matt Banks of Kent Police said: These three men preyed upon a vulnerable woman and then took advantage of her in the worst possible way. They separated her from her friend during the early hours of the morning with a plan to fulfil their own depraved sexual desires. Thanks to the cooperation of the nightclub and other local businesses, we were able to obtain excellent footage, which showed the men on the lead up to the attack. This material has been vital to this investigation and instrumental in their conviction.

Zephanie Woodward was forced to bail out of vehicle after just 30 minutes as the temperature shot up to 46\u0026degC. The potentially deadly temperatures inside the mum-of-two\u0027s car were recorded even with one of the windows open very slightly. The 35-year-old, who works in Bridgend, South Wales, was equipped for the experiment with a thermometer and the stopwatch on her mobile. The clip shows the car thermometer recording a temperature outside on Wednesday afternoon of 31\u0026degC.  Zephanie posted the clip to Shepherds Veterinary Hospital’s Facebook page, where she works as a director.  She said: “In this video I experience what it must be like when a dog is left in a car.  “I couldn\u0027t believe the temperatures that were reached, and came out feeling pretty unwell. Please think about your pets in this heatwave.”  Talking to the camera, she says: “I thought I would come and have a little sit in my car and decide how it must feel for the dogs being left in the car and see how long I can cope with it.”  After seven minutes in the car, Zephanie tells viewers: “I feel like I’ve got a little bit of a sweat on, I’m certainly glad I’m not a dog wearing a fur coat.” At this point the temperature outside the car is still at 31\u0026degC but after seven minutes the car’s internal temperature has already jumped to just under 38\u0026degC. Zephanie admits she feels ok at the point, but when the clip jumps forward to 12 minutes of being inside the car - the temperature inside has jumped to 41\u0026degC She tells viewers: “I am sweating now. If I was a dog I would be panting away, and therefore losing water. I’d be needing a drink.  “It’s approaching the point where I am definitely uncomfortable.” When Zephanie gets to 21 minutes inside the car she admits that she is “melting” as the temperature jumps up to nearly 44 degrees. (111F) When Zephanie gets to a full 30-minutes in the car she is visibly red-faced and sweaty. Zephanie brings her temperature gauge up to the camera and shows that it has reached a staggering 46 degrees (114F). The vet says: “I have had enough. I’m getting out of here. I’m pretty convinced if I was a dog you would probably come in to find me collapsed at the bottom of your car. “So please, don’t forget. Dog’s die in hot cars.” On social media, Hel L Rosser (corr) said: “Well done Zephanie for highlighting the stupidity of leaving a dog locked in a vehicle for any length of time in hot temperatures. Having had the misfortune to have had my dog collapse with heat exhaustion, not by being in a locked car, it is the most horrendous thing to witness.” Gillian Tatchell added:”You deserve a medal for your effort sitting in your car. Hopefully people will realise how quickly temperature rises. Well done.” "},{"url":null,"title":"devastated shop owner worst day","story":"NewsDevastated shop owner has \u0027worst day ever\u0027 after only making £12 - until something \u0027amazing\u0027 happensAn independent bookshop owner has revealed how her \u0027worst\u0027 sale day turned into a day she\u0027ll never forget\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByCourtney Pochin10:42, 29 JUN 2018NewsGeorgia Duffy, owner of Imagined Things book shop in Harrogate (Image: Richard Perry / Triangle News)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt\u0027s a tough climate for retailers right now.

David Sewell, a real-life \u0027Walter White\u0027, appeared to live a normal life after moving to Udon Thani, Thailand, several years ago. During the day he would visit Buddhist temples, hand out food to the region\u0027s poor, and look after his family\u0027s pet bulldog. But each night, he would disappear in his unassuming grey Honda Civic. The 60-year-old\u0027s Thai wife, Maen, 47, says she thought her husband was simply out drinking with pals when he vanished in the vehicle.  But as it turns out, Sewell was apparently leading a double life dealing drugs to other expats and pensioners in the country, local police say. Cops became suspicious when they saw him acting strangely while parked up on a roadside on Thursday evening with the door open. They walked over to speak with him, but he is said to have panicked. At the time, the retired businessman allegedly had a large bag of cannabis, 80 methamphetamine pills, five bags of crystal meth and seven bags of cocaine on the front passenger seat. Several police cars gave chase at speed for more than six miles, before Sewell ploughed into the back of an 18-wheel truck on a motorway.  He was rushed to hospital but was later pronounced dead. Officers said the drugs were stashed inside empty smartphone boxes. They believe that the Brit, who ran an importing and exporting business, had been regularly selling them to other expats for several years, mimicking the hit TV show Breaking Bad. Police Lieutenant Colonel Pattanawong Janpon, deputy chief of Udon Thani Provincial Police Station, said: \u0027\u0027We saw a car with the driver\u0027s door open and went over to see if there was a problem. We noticed that the driver was a foreigner.  \u0027\u0027He was very surprised when he saw us and panicked. He slammed the door closed and drove away quickly. We knew then that there was something illegal going on so we called for back-up.\u0027\u0027 Lieutenant Colonel Janpon said that several patrol cars joined the chase, before Sewell smashed into the back of a lorry at around 9pm. The police chief added: \u0027\u0027The crash happened at about 21:00. We immediately called for an ambulance. \u0027\u0027The foreigner was removed from the wreckage but his injuries were life-threatening and he died later in hospital.\u0027\u0027 Police contacted Maen, with whom Sewell had one daughter.

Nikki DuBose was just nine-years-old when her artist mum, Sandy Pierce, began her five year reign of abuse. Her childhood memories are full of being groped, witnessing domestic violence, watching her mum carry out sex acts, as well bath times taking a sinister turn.  It started with me taking baths, she told Entity Mag .  When I was around eight or nine, my mom would (as she called it) ‘take my temperature’ a lot in the bathroom. There were other things that happened.  Her sexual behavior escalated until I was 13. It was a very confusing time for me. Nikki tried to tell her dad, who divorced her mum when she was two, what was happening as well as the police, but she was living in fear she would be killed. Eventually police removed her from the house when she was 13. To numb the pain, Nikki suppressed the memories until her late 20s but it led to depression, suicide attempts, self-harm and bullimia. Her addictions also spiralled out of control and she started doing drugs, drinking a lot and partying from the age of 13.  Her mother, who was an alcoholic, suffered from her own addictions and had bipolar and dissociative identity disorder. The mental scars of what she\u0027d endured haunted Nikki, who grew up in Charleston, South Carolina and is now 33. And in her darkest moments she became a sex addict and slept with multiple people a day, including strangers, had affairs and also slept with her boss.  I did it all on autopilot, with a numbness in my soul that I couldn’t kill, Nikki wrote on an online blog .  Every time I thought I could walk away from the sex and the lifestyle, it trapped me like a slave, and I put myself in even more dangerous situations.  The sex always got riskier the inner pain, more pronounced. It wasn\u0027t until her mother died aged 45, due to an alcohol related car accident in 2012, Nikki knew she needed to get help and re-evaluate her life. She gave up her successful career travelling the world as a model, and appearing in the likes of Vogue, Maxim, Vanity Fair, to get away from the industry which was a \u0027trigger for her addictive personality\u0027.

Sandra Malcolm, 74, was hacked to death by Sheree Prince, 22, who had broken into her Cape Town home.  Mrs Malcolm, who was originally from Monifieth, Angus, had been helping the young woman after she suffered an injury - but Prince turned on her, fearing she would call police.  Prince said Mrs Malcolm fed her tea and toast, but when she offered to call an ambulance, Prince became suspicious and stabbed her 24 times.  Prince beheaded the pensioner with a knife and cut off her arms using an axe before throwing her body into a wheelie bin.  Police arrested Prince in Citrusdal, 100 miles north of Cape Town, a few days after the grandmother\u0027s death in April 2015. She admitted the murder in March and has now been given a life sentence at the Western Cape High Court. Under South African law, Prince will have to serve 25 years before she can apply for parole. Last month it was revealed the killer had written a letter to the family of Mrs Malcolm begging for forgiveness. The letter, which was handed to the court, read: I thank the court for doing my case. During my time in prison I have had time to think of everything. I wouldn\u0027t know who the family is, but I would like the family to please forgive me and accept my apology as time goes by. However, Mrs Malcolm\u0027s daughter Alison Williams, 51, told the court the letter meant nothing and called for Prince to face the harshest punishment possible. Speaking at a pre-sentencing hearing, she said: We cannot accept her apology. The whole family is asking for the highest amount of incarceration this court can hand down.

It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

Stuart has done both during his time there.”Armstrong added: “Southampton seems a really good fit for me. Watching from afar, I really enjoy the attractive football that they play and I’m very happy to be here.“Every season, I put demands on myself to create and score goals.

It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time.

I’m sure the local council is aware of this and it would cost thousands of pounds.“This would need to be carried out for at least 10 years and even then, you wouldn’t visibly notice a big drop in the population.“I’m afraid to say you’ve got urban gulls and you’re not going to get rid of them. You may – with a great deal of expense – reduce the population slightly over time. But there is maybe a case to start embracing them.“Down at Bristol City Football Club, the team has celebrated the fact they share the city with their neighbours with a gull painted on one of the stands.”But some residents said many Dundee streets have such a problem with gulls they look like a scene from Jurassic Park.German Doner Kebab manager, Michael Dobson, 29, reckons the problem is largely man-made.He said: “I understand the council needs to look at other measures. There needs to be more awareness to stop feeding them. The residential bins are a nightmare – in the street you see gulls feasting on the rubbish.”Charlene Hutchison, 33, a supervisor at German Doner Kebab, said she is “terrified” to walk down Reform Street.She added: “If I’m on a day off I won’t walk down the street. My niece got attacked when she was only seven.”Heather Davidson, 40, from Broughty Ferry, said in her area the problem is just as bad.She said: “These birds are so big now it’s like a scene from Jurassic Park.”Taffy Barrington, 50, from the city centre, said the gull’s had become “fearless”. He said: “A couple of Saturdays ago I actually saw gulls scrapping over a pizza.“They are completely fearless of cars as well now.”A Dundee City Council spokeswoman said: “We know that gulls can often be a cause for considerable distress and annoyance and we continually pursue tried and tested as well as innovative solutions to the problems that arise from these birds.“We are proactive in improving the waste disposal facilities in and around the city centre. Bins have been provided in many areas where previously waste bags were placed on the footpaths and became magnets for gulls.“Routine monitoring of this situation ensures that problem areas are swiftly identified to enable further action to be taken. We would also ask that people do not feed seagulls as this exacerbates the problem.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35ef77343e9-375x564.jpg ","title":"its the penguin parade colourful trail goes live across dundee and tayside","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPenguins are popping up across Dundee and Tayside as part of a much-anticipated charity trail.And now, all 80 giant fibreglass birds which make up the Maggie’s Penguin Parade are in place.The colourfully decorated penguin sculptures will be displayed in the city and beyond over the summer, with families being challenged to locate them all.Each 5ft bird has been uniquely designed in aid of cancer charity Maggie’s, by artists who have taken inspiration from topics including footballers and the history of Dundee.The penguin parade is a partnership event between Maggie’s Dundee and Wild in Art.Maggie’s Dundee fundraising manager Annie Long said: “It’s wonderful to have our penguins in place and ready to be enjoyed by people from across the Dundee area and hopefully far beyond.”Famous names such as Judy Murray, Simple Minds and Lorraine Kelly have been involved in designing or sponsoring a penguin.Artist Tom Harris-Ward customised his penguin, located at Verdant Works, by adding a piece of wood from the RRS Discovery.Abertay University students have also been involved in the initiative after collaborating with Maggie’s to develop an app for the “Maggie and Fleur” penguin positioned outside Abertay University Library.Director of Wild in Art, Charlie Langhorne, said: “Maggie’s Penguin Parade is a celebration of creativity and of Dundee.The whole Maggie’s team is to be congratulated on such a fantastic spectacle that will bring a smile to the many thousands of people who will come and enjoy the trail.Now ‘waddle on’ and do the Penguin Parade.”More than 70,000 people took part in the city’s previous trail featuring Oor Wullie, in aid of the Archie Foundation.Funds from the penguin parade will help towards the cost of running the Maggie’s centre based at Ninewells. The penguins will be displayed until September before they are auctioned off to raise money for the centre.Free Penguin trail maps are now available to pick up at various locations across the city, including Discovery Point and the VisitScotland tourist information office in Dundee City Square.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b35f026106d0-e1530267207474-738x564.jpg ","title":"kerb height roundabout to be installed on notorious dundee road in bid to stop speeders","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA residents’ group has hailed “people power” after it was able to convince Dundee City Council to install anti-speeding measures on a stretch of road notorious for speeding.People in Emmock Woods met council officers this week to discuss plans for a raised roundabout connecting William Fitzgerald Way and Middleton Crescent.Angee Grant, chairwoman of the Emmock Woods Residents’ Group, said she was “jubilant” about their victory.“It’s a rare bit of good news,” she said.“It won’t stop all the speeding but we’re hoping this is the start of something more.”Roundabout markings are currently painted on to the junction, which is about 300 yards from the nearby Butterflies nursery.Residents say their claims that drivers ignored the markings and regularly exceeded the speed limit were brushed aside by the council.However, the group has now been told to expect a “kerb height” circle to be built in the middle of the junction, which will prevent motorists from driving straight over it as they may have before.Angee added: “We still want other changes to come in, like a 20mph speed limit and signs that flash up your speed – but this is a good start.“It’s a real example of the power of a community – it’s people power.”Angee and other locals formed the Emmock Woods residents’ group and started a petition to bring traffic calming measures to the area after their initial complaints were ignored.More than 400 people signed the online petition, with hundreds of other signatures collected on people’s doorsteps.The group has now applied to be formally recognised as a residents’ association that goes beyond addressing the speeding issues in the area.Angee said: “We’re quite proud of ourselves because there’s never been a residents’ group in Emmock Woods before.“We’re going to apply for funding and look at ways we can improve the village green. We’re getting a noticeboard to improve communication in the area.“Emmock Woods wasn’t put forward for Dundee Decides – but that was just because nobody went for it.”Dundee City Council confirmed the residents’ victory.A spokeswoman said: “We can confirm these works will be going ahead within the current financial year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b07ca52052f7-e1530275572157.jpg ","title":"kingsway motorists told to plan ahead due to road closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMotorists using the Kingsway are being told to plan journeys in advance as a stretch of the carriageway will be closed for the weekend.The eastbound carriageway from the Old Glamis Road to the Forfar Road junction is closed until 6.30am on Monday.As reported in the Tele earlier this week, the closures are to allow Dundee City Council workers to begin installing new pedestrian crossings that link the Caird Park with the residential areas south of the Kingsway.The new crossings allow cyclists and pedestrians to cross to and from the park safely.Kingsway will close in the other direction from next Friday until the following Monday.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas. There’s definitely specific targets on that and we are working hard on that but we won’t be giving anything away.”Missing from pre-season so far have been Craig Wighton and Glen Kamara both of whom were on international duty after their seasons with Dundee ended.Centre-half Steven Caulker has also been absent because of charity work he was committed to before joining up at Dens early this year but all three will report back today.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b32068acec06-839x564.jpg ","title":"new boy mendy almost signed by dundee in january","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann has revealed he was close to signing new Dundee arrival Jean Alassane Mendy back in January.He held talks with the Senegalese striker back then but was pipped for his signature by Belgians Lokeren.Things did not work out for Mendy there and now Neil is delighted to have been able to get a player he believes can score regularly in the top flight.He said: \u0026#8220We tried to get him in January and I think we missed out by just a couple of hours.

One thing I like about him as well is that he’s got a very good work ethic because we are not the kind of team who can let people stand about.“There are a lot of strikers who bang in goals but I am not sure whether they have the work ethic to be my kind of player.“Jean ticked that box for me, he’s got good English and has played in a few countries so I think he will settle easily.”Meanwhile, young Dundee midfielder Jesse Curran has signed up for another year at Dens Park.The 21-year-old Australian has been in talks over a new deal for some time.He made eight top team appearances last term and manager Neil McCann was keen to hang on to him.Along with striker Matty Henvey, who penned a similar contract at the beginning of this week, the Dark Blues are looking for Curran to push for more game time in the coming campaign.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2a29a52ebfe-668x564.jpg ","title":"paralympian cyclist hannah thanks all who contributed to championship funds","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Paralympic cyclist, who found her passion while studying in Dundee, has crowd-funded enough money to enable her to compete – and also a surplus to help other cyclists.Hannah Dines, 25, who has cerebral palsy, was recently chosen for the Paracycling Road World Championships.

year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or ideas for improvements.She can be contacted by

Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted. It\u0027s now up to the health boards.\"I\u0027d urge those in the north and east to consider having the focus ultrasound scanner because there\u0027s currently nothing for people with neurological problems, ET or otherwise, in these areas.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate.

And the Reds have also been linked with former Ross County striker Alex Schalk.“We’re light at the back so we need to get another defender in,” said McInnes.“That’s probably the area we’re concentrating on at the minute.“If you can’t always bring something better you can bring something different to the team.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life. A\u0026ampB is home to many country roads enjoyed by bikers, so road safety is clearly a key issue for our team.\u0026#8217Anyone interested in learning more about the Scottish Biker Down or would like to book one of the courses can email adam.barclay@firescotland.gov.uk to book your place on the course or visit our Facebook page ‘Biker Down Scotland’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the end is in sight for strone point project","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 10:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA project that started back in December to improve a notorious accident blackspot on the A83 is almost finished.Having dealt with traffic lights at the site for six months, drivers may be willing to put up with two planned nights of complete road closure next week after it was announced that the scheme should be complete in a few weeks.The  bend realignment project on the trunk road at Strone Point, near Inveraray, began with main contractor John Paul Construction working on the steep slope above the road to stabilise it.A number of further improvement works at ground level followed across the 360 metre-long site, including the construction of new carriageway, installation of new drainage systems, shoreside retaining wall construction and installation of new safety barrier and warning signs.These phases have all progressed well in recent weeks, with the final activities due to be completed by mid July.A final phase of overnight closures will be needed while the road surface is laid, including the application of high friction surfacing.The overnight closures are scheduled to take place from Tuesday July 3 for two nights, 9pm to 5am each night. Road users will be sent on the usual lengthy diversion via the A819, A85 and the A82, though access will be maintained  for emergency vehicles.Following completion of the surfacing, further minor construction works to complete the project will take place ahead of the A83 opening to both lanes again later in July.Eddie Ross, of trunk road management company BEAR Scotland, said: \u0026#8216We thank motorists and the local community for their continued patience while teams work to complete the project.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12802034.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/swr_ayp_270318esther.jpg","title":"claims south ayrshire council poised","story":"NewsClaims that South Ayrshire Council poised to swoop on crumbling hotelCollapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley11:31, 27 JUN 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: ayrshire post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The council is poised to swoop on the Station Hotel to undertake emergency repairs it is claimed.  Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"waiting-list-created-as-traders-flock-to-selkirk-market","story":"ORGANISERS of the new Selkirk Farmers\u0027 Market have revealed there is already a waiting list for stalls.\nThe inaugural event took place at the start of the month.\nAnd many of the 15 traders had sold out of stock within hours of opening.\nAll 15 stalls have already been booked for the second Market on Saturday, July 7.\nSelkirkshire councillor Caroline Penman said: \"The first Market was a huge success and the feedback from stallholders as well as shoppers was extremely positive.\n\"Many of the stallholders immediately booked for the next month and we now have a waiting list.\"\nLocal organisations receive a boost from the monthly Market with Selkirk Rugby Club\u0027s junior section receiving \u0026pound300 for assembling and taking down the stalls.\nAnd next month it will be the turn of the Selkirk Silver Band to receive the rental donation.\nA further \u0026pound75 was also given to Scott\u0027s Selkirk following the June Market.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"a-decade-of-singing-about-to-be-celebrated-in-peebles","story":"IT all began with an advertisement in the Peeblesshire News almost a decade ago.\nAndrew Russel, realising that contemporary choirs could be the next big thing, asked for anyone interested in singing as part of a community choir to pop into the Eastgate on September 2, 2008.\nHe expected around 30.\nWhat he got was around 130.\nEven after auditions had taken place, there were still over 100 members.\nAnd many of these founder members are still with this big choir today as it prepares for its 10th birthday celebrations.\nInChorus quickly became known -for their vibrant enthusiastic performances.\nThey were invited to sing at the public opening of the Scottish Parliament in May 2010.\nThe same year, they were asked by the American organisers of the September Concerts - a programme set up following the 9/11 atrocities to promote peace through music - to stage a concert on September 11, which took place at a packed Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and was streamed around the world.\nThis led to the choir travelling to New York to take part in the 10th anniversary commemorations of 9/11 in 2011.\nInChorus embarked on a huge fundraising programme for this and were blown away by the support they received from the community.\nOne fundraiser was a concert in the Usher Hall where they were joined by, among others, Mhairi Campbell and Dougie Maclean. InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people.

While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014. Aly was responsible for the huge flash mob \u0026lsquoDancing in the Street\u0026rsquo event last year, involving the whole community.\nShe told us: \"Whilst singing is at the heart of everything that InChorus has achieved over the last 10 years, it\u0026rsquos never been only that.\n\"Through this organisation we have seen people\u0026rsquos friendships, confidence, skills, self-esteem and both emotional and physical health all flourish and grow over the years.\n\"In return the members give their time freely and generously to learn, rehearse and perform music for the benefit of others.\n\"In its time InChorus has achieved and given so much more than any of us really ever anticipated at the outset and I think every member feels so proud about that.\nIt\u0026rsquos amazing what a community can achieve when they group together, take a collective breath and burst into song.\"\nThey say that into every life a little rain must fall, and InChorus has not escaped, losing three much loved ladies to cancer.\nIn 2016 it was founder members Kitty Lyle and Celia Hayton and, just a few weeks ago, Bernice Brown - all are missed greatly.\nThroughout its 10 years the choir has raised over \u0026pound60,000 for other charities, both through its own concerts and through specific charity events.\nThis is something that is at the core of InChorus, something of which they are proud, and something which will continue in the years to come.\nAt one charity dinner they even put up an InChorus performance as an auction prize and were \u0026lsquosold\u0026rsquo for over \u0026pound1100. This, in turn, led to a performance at a very prestigious charity dinner in aid of breast cancer.\nTo celebrate its 10th birthday, the choir will be travelling to Barcelona in October for a long weekend of performances.\nBut before that they have a bit of a party planned in Peebles.\nOn September 1, the actual birthday weekend, they have organised their \u0026lsquoTen out of Ten\u0026rsquo day - when they will sing throughout the day from a list of at least ten different favourite songs, at ten different locations in Peebles.\nAlthough the earlier locations have yet to be revealed the finale will take place at the Eastgate Theatre, where it all started ten years ago, for an evening concert.\nThis will also be the final event of the 2018 Creative Peebles Festival.\nThe choir hopes you will join them or, at least, come and say hello.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"united-front-to-boost-the-borderlands","story":"HUNDREDS of stakeholders had their say on proposals to transform the Borderlands economy at a special conference in Dumfries on Monday.\nLeader of Dumfries and Galloway Council, Elaine Murray, welcomed more than 370 business representatives, public sector organisations and individuals to the first Borderlands conference.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoI am delighted that so many people attended on the day, this shows what an important project the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal is.\n\"One attendee described the conference as an \u0026lsquoIlluminating and fantastic event\u0026rsquo, which reflected the enthusiasm I perceived on the day, that this is a once in a generation opportunity which must be seized.\nFive local authorities from north and south of the border are working in partnership to put together a proposal that should have huge implications for those who live, work and visit the area.\nIt was the first opportunity for interested parties to hear about the themes that are being developed to underpin the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal \u0026ndash and to give their views on the major projects they believe would kickstart transformation.\nThe conference was held at a key time for the partnership, made up of Carlisle City, Cumbria County, Dumfries and Galloway, Northumberland County and Scottish Borders Councils.\nResponses from the conference will help the partnership to build a case to present to both the UK and Scottish Governments later this year. Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future. I think we are at that point where we either put up or shut up. We get out there, we shout, we demand and we create the business opportunities.\nThose attending quizzed a panel, chaired by the UK Government\u0026rsquos Borderlands champion John Stevenson MP, on how the deal could support inclusivity, tourism projects and benefit small rural communities.\nFor more information visit the partnership website www.Borderlandsgrowth or email info@borderlandsgrowth\n"},{"url":null,"title":"youngsters-make-a-splash-at-braw-lads-swimming-gala","story":"SPECTATORS crammed into Galashiels Swimming Pool on Tuesday night for the Braw Lads\u0027 Swimming Gala.\nBraw Lad Greg Kelly, Braw Lass Kimberley O\u0027May and their attendants were given a rousing welcome as they came to support the young competitors.\nAnd the swimmers from all age groups put on a fantastic display throughout the evening, which culminated with the mixed aged group Braw Lads\u0027 Relay Race.\nThis event didn\u0027t disappoint.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716324961,16324950,16324926,16324091,16323237\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

Would those closest to you think so?​Lots of questions this week.As we get to know each other better, our answer to the questions deepen.Jesus first asked his disciples who people said he was and they gave many answers.Then Jesus put them on the spot and said: \u0026#8216Who do you say that I am?\u0026#8217I can imagine the disciples looking puzzled and looking from one to the other for an answer.I imagine the silence would hang in the warm night air as Jesus waited for a response.And it was Peter who gave the answer that resonates through time when he said: \u0026#8216You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u0026#8217Peter had recognised the wonder of this man before him and knew that he was of God.Jesus praised Peter for his intuition and no doubt the others knew they were in the presence of a sacred moment.Peter was not perfect and often his coat was on a shuggly peg, but in the end he served his Lord and went on to die for his faith.Who are you?\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane extra june 23 2018","story":"Voluntary curator and trustee Marlyn Moffat is steadily archiving those images and has let the Courier reproduce one of a Main Street accident.It is a bus embedded in what is now Ms Moffat\u0026#8217s shop Made in Kintyre.

The atmosphere here is just amazing.\u0026#8217Away from the World Cup frenzy taking place across the country, Michael described life and work in Peru’s capital, the third-largest city in the Americas.He said: \u0026#8216Lima is a crazy, bustling city. A real metropolis. There are more than eight million people living here, a quarter of Peru\u0026#8217s population, so it is always hectic.‘Rush hour is madness.

I have practiced more and more with Carla as she speaks it fluently and I would like to become fluent too.’Back in football-mad Lima, Michael described the scene before Peru’s play-off win over Oceanian champions New Zealand last November, which sealed qualification.He said: \u0026#8216Peru\u0026#8217s fans knew they were one game away from the World Cup, and rightly or wrongly, did everything to help their team advance.\u0026#8216People set off fireworks and cars beeped their horns outside the New Zealand squad\u0026#8217s hotel in the early hours of the morning of the match.\u0026#8216When Peru won 2-0, there was pandemonium.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.  Areas for improvement were identified and discussed with the headteacher and a representative from East Lothian Council.  They were:  - Increasing the opportunities for children to be more active and independent in their learning  - Continuing to improve attainment, ensuring that the pace and challenge of learning meets the needs of all children  - Continuing to develop the opportunities for leadership at all levels to support the school improvement. Increasing the scope for all members of the school community, including parents, partners and children, to be involved in discussions about aspects of the life and work of the school.  The quality indicators for the primary school showed a \u0027good\u0027 result for: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment and raising attainment and achievement. The school achieved \u0027very good\u0027 for ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.  The nursery received a \u0027good\u0027 quality indicator across the board for: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment securing children\u0027s progress and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \"I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the school staff and pupils for their hard work in achieving positive outcomes for children and their families.  \"I wish to thank Sarah Ogden in particular, our headteacher, for the strength of leadership and commitment that she has shown in recent months for the school to achieve this positive recognition.  \"I am pleased to report that Education Scotland has advised us that no further inspections are planned at the school.  \"I am also delighted to report that the school has made good progress with the areas for improvement identified within the report.  Councillor Katie Mackie, ward member for Musselburgh on East Lothian Council, said: \"This is an excellent result and well-deserved. The commitment of staff and great relationship between pupils and teachers is in clear evidence when you visit the school.\"  Miles Briggs, Lothian MSP, said: \"The attainment of either \u0027good\u0027 or \u0027very good\u0027 for all quality indicators is an exceptionally good achievement.  \"Pinkie St. Peters has gone from strength to strength and I wish them continued success for the next academic year.\""},{"url":null,"title":"photos-fancy-dress-charity-walk-in-musselburgh","story":"              THERE was a lot of clowning around at a fancy dress charity walk in Musselburgh on Saturday.  Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.  Mr Campbell said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquod like to thank everyone who supported our events."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-mum-recovering-after-losing-feet-to-sepsis","story":"              A MUSSELBURGH mum-of-two\u0026nbspwho cheated death after contracting life-threatening sepsis is now on the road to recovery.  Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.  Current school times: Dunbar Grammar School starts at 8.40am with a home time of 3.50pm Monday to Thursday and 12.30pm on Fridays Preston Lodge High School starts at 8.40am and finishes at 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.25pm on Fridays Knox Academy is 8.44am to 4pm Monday to Thursday, finishing at 12.05pm on Fridays Musselburgh Grammar School starts at 8.45am, finishing at 3.50pm and 12.30pm on Fridays North Berwick High School starts at 8.39am and finishes at 3.50pm \u0026ndash noon on Fridays Ross High School starts at 8.30am, finishing at 3.35pm \u0026ndash 11.55am on Fridays."},{"url":null,"title":"ormiston-park-formally-opens-after-years-of-refurbishment-work","story":"              SUPPORTERS of Ormiston Park celebrated its official opening on Saturday following four years of hard work.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.

We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

Numerous complaints were made on social media regarding cars and, in particular, car windscreens being covered in dust late last month.  Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence. We\u0026rsquore committed to minimising our environmental impact and apologise for any inconvenience caused. If anyone has any concerns or queries they can contact us at dunbar.feedback@tarmac  The incident took place when some clinker (nodules of cement) was being loaded into a store.  As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.  Tarmac has sent out a letter to residents and offered to arrange for cars to be washed at the company\u0026rsquos expense.

The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.  Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun asHarry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.  Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.  The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996889.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"trnsmt-2018-bar-prices-at-glasgow-festival-revealed","story":"              THE bar prices have been revealed for TRNSMT festival.

We are fond of our city, us citizens of Glasgow, and we are just as fond of talking about it. If you choose to take a journey by taxi and would rather not become involved in a stilted conversation with your driver\u0026rsquos back just ask him to tell you what makes Glasgow special and why we regard our city as the business the berries the jinkies the most refined of the cat\u0026rsquos whiskers.  In an arboreal little embankment set back from Woodlands Road, the esoteric thoroughfare that connects the city centre to its polished West End, is a modest construction that defines this city like little else. It is the world\u0026rsquos only two-legged equestrian statue that pays homage to the great cartoonist and poet, Bud Neill. This wee bronze treasure depicts the three main characters of Neill\u0026rsquos Lobey Dosser cartoon strip which ran for decades in the Evening Times from 1949. It chronicled the happenings in an imaginary Glasgow township called Calton Creek which is somehow located in Arizona in the middle of America\u0026rsquos Wild West. The horse is called El Fideldo (Elfie) and she carries on her back Lobey, sheriff of Calton Creek as well as his arch-nemesis Rank Bajin. In the strip the residents of Calton Creek all enjoyed a polite relationship with the local Native Americans whose leader Big Chief Toffy Teeth is often received with polite hospitality and offered fish and chips.  I was delighted that the Bud Neill memorial has been included in a book entitled 111 places in Glasgow That You Shouldn\u0026rsquot Miss. Yet how could it not have been? The author is Tom Shields, one of the best journalists to have written for The Herald and whose Diary columns and those of his friend Jack McLean inspired a generation of young Glaswegians to join the newspaper game.  Tom was too modest to record his own part in making the Bud Neill memorial happen, so I shall. Having floated the idea of a statue in his Diary column, his army of readers duly took up the cause and the sculpture and design was paid for out of their subscriptions, for which they were all sworn in as honorary deputy sheriffs of Calton Creek.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos difficult to convey just how successful Bud Neill\u0026rsquos cartoon stretch became, said Shields. \u0026ldquoAt the end of the working day, people formed queues at newsagents to wait on his latest offering in that day\u0026rsquos Evening Times. He had a forensic wit that seemed to capture Glasgow life and culture and the humour of its people.  Shields\u0026rsquo Diary column in The Herald made it the best-read feature in the paper and it often bore the imprint of Neill. It too chronicled the people and events of Glasgow and it was peppered with a quiet wit that seemed almost subversive. If Bud Neill could have written a newspaper column he would have made it look like Tom\u0026rsquos.  I MEET Tom on a glorious Glasgow day where the temperature has long ago climbed beyond the critical \u0026lsquotaps-aff\u0026rsquo mark in Cathedral Square at the top of the High Street. It\u0026rsquos here too that I encounter one of the many surprises in his book. \u0026ldquoI was once told that many of Glasgow\u0026rsquos treasures are hidden in plain sight. I\u0026rsquom not sure exactly what that means but I think that they have been airbrushed out of the history of our city and that often we walk past them or through them or above them not knowing of their presence or the stories that they carry.  I\u0026rsquove arranged to meet him at the old Police Box that sits towards the front of Cathedral Square and which has metamorphosed into the Empire Coffee Shop. It is run by barristo and chef Rocco Conforti and the following conversation takes place.  \u0026ldquoDo you take a card as I\u0026rsquove only a couple of quid of change.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not working today, but not to worry you can hand it in any time.  \u0026ldquoWell, I\u0026rsquom meeting my friend here so he can cough up the extra 20p for your cappuccino. I used to look after his expenses, so he owes me a few.  \u0026ldquoAh, so what do you do? I work in newspapers and \u0026hellip  \u0026ldquoAh, you\u0026rsquore here to meet Tom \u0026hellip I am in his book.  And Rocco then brandishes a copy of it and it\u0026rsquos clear that he\u0026rsquos as happy as Luigi to be included in it. \u0026ldquoI am selling them here.  The coffee is brand new, by the way, but there\u0026rsquos a reason why an apparently historically and culturally unremarkable place such as this appears in a book about places in Glasgow you shouldn\u0026rsquot miss. It tells a story of a time when the city had more than 300 of these and how a smart idea followed by hard graft and a little tenderness has resurrected them. It begins a theme running through this book which is much, much more than a quaint travel guide. \u0026ldquoWe all have our own ideas of Glasgow you know it when you see it sometimes, says Tom. This was one of those times and one of those places, said Tom.  Behind Rocco\u0026rsquos Police Coffee Box is a statue whose existence until last week was unknown to me. It sits in its own grove, sheltering under trees and fenced off with iron railings. It\u0026rsquos as if it is here only on sufferance, yet it is a high and handsome thing: a bronze equestrian sculpture and a rider brandishing a sword and clad in the style of a Roman General. It\u0026rsquos none other than King Billy himself or \u0026ldquoGlasgow\u0026rsquos favourite Orangeman as Tom has described it. \u0026ldquoThis one\u0026rsquos a bit of an enigma, says Tom. \u0026ldquoIt also might be deemed to be curiously Vaticanesque by some of the Order\u0026rsquos present-day adherents. It began life near the foot of the street on which he is currently perched in 1735 at Glasgow Cross.  Across the road behind Provand\u0026rsquos Lordship there\u0026rsquos another hidden delight. This is beginning to get embarrassing. In the space of half an hour at the top of Glasgow\u0026rsquos most historic street (still beautiful despite the wrecking ball that Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde University have taken to it) I have been introduced to three landmarks previously unknown to me.  This is St Nicholas Garden where Bishop Edward Muirhead set up St Nicholas Hospital to care for indigent, elderly men. The place exists only in its name and in this garden, landscaped in 1995, and which carries echoes of its original purpose. We\u0026rsquore both enchanted by it. \u0026ldquoI like that some imagination and sensitivity to its original use has gone into its design. The gardens are full of medicinal herbs and spices which recall its origins. It\u0026rsquos beautifully landscaped and you can be peaceful here. If only the same care and attention had gone into that faux-baronial piece of kitsch across the road. This is the only mention of the new and unlovely Museum of Religion in this book.  A pattern is stitched into the pages of this book and these places at the top of the High Street carry glimpses of it. The book will be marketed as a travel guide or a travel companion but this is no insipid selection of the usual Glasgow landmarks that appear in tourist brochures. Most Glaswegians who read this will be unfamiliar with more than half of these chosen places. Many of them have slowly been scrubbed out of the city\u0026rsquos narrative because they shine a torch on the rapacious vandalism and rank stupidity of planners and politicians who levelled some lovely old neighbourhoods and eviscerated others.  One of these districts is Anderston, a vibrant old working class neighbourhood which formed a gateway to the city centre on its western approach. But Glasgow\u0026rsquos civic vandals drove a motorway through the middle of it, cutting it off from the centre and then leaving it to twist in the wind as the families moved out and some beautiful tenements came down. \u0026ldquoWhy couldn\u0026rsquot they just have built it under this neighbourhood, or over it? Why did they take a wrecking ball to an entire community? asks Tom.  And yet a remembrance of what this place once looked like lives in the stones of a remarkable building surrounded by dismal modern apartment blocks that possess all the charm and imagination of a port-a-cabin. This is the old Savings Bank, a gorgeous A-listed, red sandstone tenement inlaid with a craftsmanship and artistry you\u0026rsquoll travel far to match. Tom warms to its tale and the themes which suffuse the rest of his book. \u0026ldquoI love the carving of that wised-looking chap, clutching a bag of money and lifting a finger as if to caution prudence in the ways of handling it. This is Henry Duncan, founder of the Savings Bank movement who studied at St Andrews University before being sent to Liverpool to work in a bank. But a life in the service of The Lord beckoned and as a minister he was able to combine his sacred calling with his practical training and the concept of bank to help ordinary people survive hard times. What would old man Duncan have made of today\u0026rsquos banks which drive people and small firms into hardship and then feed off their carcasses?  And then there\u0026rsquos the tragedy of Springburn which seems to encapsulate how a working class community can be hollowed out and left to rot. In the book Tom takes us to Springburn Park set in the midst of a proud inner city neighbourhood to the north of the city centre. Here, his anger is barely concealed: \u0026ldquoIt its day it was home to the world\u0026rsquos biggest chemical works and Europe\u0026rsquos biggest manufacturer of railway engines. But instead of fixing its slum housing and attempting to manage industrial downturn, the decision was taken simply to doze 85 per cent of vibrant Springburn to the ground. The most vicious wound was a huge dual carriageway punched through its heart for the benefit of commuters from wealthier suburbs. Other cities protect and develop their old communities and help them in hard times Glasgow builds concrete freeways like this and the M8 and the M77 (another road built through a working class community to accommodate the lifestyles of affluent people in the southern suburbs).  The book is infused with a gentle subversiveness and a whispered humour as though providing a voice for the Glaswegians who have gone and whose lives went uncelebrated and often disrupted by planners and politicians. Some time soon I will take a two-week vacation to my own city and discover it once more get to know the people who made it. This will be my guide.  111 Places in Glasgow That You Shouldn\u0027t Miss, by Tom Shields, is published by Emons, \u0026pound12.99  TOM SHIELDS\u0027 HIDDEN GLASGOW GEMS  Wallace\u0026rsquos Well (Auchinleck Road)  The historic significance of this modest shrine to Scotland\u0026rsquos most famous freedom fighter cannot be over-stated. It was here in 1305 that William Wallace had his last sip of water as a free man.  The Berkeley Suite (North Street)  A bar and ballroom frozen in time and known only to Glasgow\u0026rsquos hip cognoscenti and demi-monde. The pawn shop fa\u0026ccedilade is just that, a fa\u0026ccedilade, to deter those who really ought to know. It carries echoes of swinging, 60s Glasgow.  Buffalo Bill statue (Whitehill Street)  This evocative sculpture holds a story that is at once tragic and hilarious, involving a native American called Kicking Bear, his belligerent chum Charging Thunder, an assault on a city impresario and allegations of spiked whisky in an east end pub.  The Cuningar Loop (Dalmarnock)  The site of the original Gorbals and a geographical curiosity on the Clyde it became a dumping ground for building rubble. Now it\u0026rsquos happily re-invented as a children\u0026rsquos adventure park hosting a vast assortment of wildlife, sculptures and activities.  Homeless Jesus (Nelson Mandela Place)  Perhaps only in Glasgow, this stunning bronze depicts Jesus curled up and lying on a bench. The wounds on the feet are the clue and it\u0026rsquos a stark reminder of Glasgow\u0026rsquos poor and downtrodden in the middle of its main palaces of consumption.  La Pasionara Memorial (Custom House Quay, Clyde Street)  This simple tribute to Dolores Ibarruri, the great Republican activist in the Spanish Civil War stands as a memorial to the Scots who joined the International brigade to fight against Franco and fascism. Its construction led to a small civil war in Glasgow\u0026rsquos City Chambers too.  The Women\u0026rsquos Library (Landressy Street)  The only accredited museum in the UK devoted to women\u0026rsquos lives, struggles and achievements. It\u0026rsquos also a lending library and is housed in an Edwardian architectural jewel funded by Carnegie in 1906."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7991908.jpg?type=article-full","title":"top-10-scotlands-all-time-favourite-albums","story":"              Scotland has always punched above its weight when it comes to pop and rock, producing some of the most talented, sublime, quirky and best-loved bands and performers of the last 50 years, from influential indie pioneers to global superstars.  Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For more than 25 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

New figures show the average salary of Scottish graduates was \u0026pound23,500 in 2016/17 - \u0026pound500 more than students leaving university in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  The highest salaries of \u0026pound33,500 were earned by graduates from medicine and dentistry, followed by the \u0026pound30,000 for those who studied social studies, engineering or mathematical science.  The lowest salaries for Scottish graduates was the \u0026pound21,000 for those who studied creative art and design.  The figures, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, come after the \u0026ldquoobsession of teachers and parents with a university degree was questioned in recent weeks.  Sir Ian Wood, a philanthropist and former Wood Group chief executive, said parents and teachers pressurised pupils to go to university without knowing whether it was the best option for them.  And he called for a greater focus on the importance of vocational qualifications - as well as a campaign to highlight successful and lucrative careers outside the traditional professions.

But this latest chapter in its chequered history takes some beating.  For over a century this majestic building which sits on a hill off Sauchiehall Street has been the beating heart of Glasgow\u0027s cultural life. It\u0027s no exaggeration to say that Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s Art Nouveau masterwork has fostered some of the brightest and most creative talents Scotland has ever produced.  It survived two world wars and one almost catastrophic fire four years ago. Now, with the news that large sections of The Mack will be \"dismantled\" within days following a second inferno two weeks ago, it looks like the end is nigh for The Mack.  No-one could have predicted the turn of events which led to the almost-renovated building being burned to a crisp. It was late on a Friday night \u0026ndash graduation day as it happened for Glasgow School of Art\u0027s latest cohort of students \u0026ndash when the fire was first noticed by a passing policeman. Within an hour, it had spread like wildfire. The flames licked over to the adjacent O2 ABC venue and soon its roof caved had in like a sunken blancmange.  Today, all around The Mack\u0027s majestic teetering walls, there is both physical and mental turmoil. Since that fateful night, people have been unable to return to their homes in the area around Garnethill and Sauchiehall Street. Businesses in the immediate vicinity have been locked out, with business owners and staff facing penury. Crowdfunding campaigns have even been started by small non-funded creative business based in the nearby CCA on Sauchiehall Street looking for financial help to pay staff.  Yesterday, First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, revealed during First Minister\u0027s Questions at Holyrood that a hardship fund to help people forced from their homes thanks to a safety cordon around the building will give \u0026pound1,500 to residents affected which will be matched by Glasgow City Council.  In the immediate aftermath of the fire the painter, Alison Watt, who graduated from GSA in the late 1980s and whose artist father James also graduated from the art school in the 1950s, talked on national radio about her intense feelings of loss on hearing that The Mack had been engulfed by flames yet again.  Turner Prize winning artist and GSA alumni, Douglas Gordon, flew back to Scotland from his home in Paris to see \"the corpse of the Mackintosh\". He speaks for many former students and staff when he added, \"part of my life has been cut out.\"  It all feels so distant from the cold February day last year when Gordon led me on a tour of the empty Mack for a feature in The Herald magazine. \"It [The Mack] was a place of real freedom,\" he told me. \"I haven\u0027t lived in Glasgow for nearly 30 years but it all feels really immediate. I feel both nostalgic and melancholic all at the same time.\"  While we were there, Gordon picked up a couple of pieces of green plaster from the floor which had fallen off one of the studio walls. \"Here, take this,\" he whispered conspiratorially. I still have these shards of green plaster from The Mack. They are sitting winking at me as I write.  In the two weeks since the Mack fire, mark two, I have watched as people\u0027s feelings turned from shock to anger. I have read accusations of mismanagement on the art school\u0027s part and rumours that there was inadequate insurance in place.  A statement put out by the Glasgow School of Art the day after put it so baldly, the Mackintosh Building had been undergoing a period or extensive restoration following the fire in 2014 \u0027and therefore has not been a part of the GSA\u0027s operational campus for four years.\"  The blame game started immediately in the media and on social media. All over my virtual world \u0026ndash admittedly filled with people linked to the creative community in Scotland \u0026ndash there has been much wailing and gnashing of teeth. People are livid and looking for someone to blame.  Where was the sprinkler system in the renovated building, people asked? That same question was asked four years ago and the same people feel they didn\u0027t get answers.  Leading GSA-trained architect, Alan Dunlop, prompted anger when he suggested that The Mack should be demolished and an international competition be launched to create a new building with the same spirit. Mackintosh was an innovator, he said, and he would not have wanted a facsimile\u0026hellip  Since Mackintosh isn\u0027t around to give his view, we will never know.    Friday\u0027s cartoon by Steven Camley  Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who is director of the Glasgow Building Preservation Trust, was one of the first public figures to be allowed behind the cordon around The Mack after the fire. His observations that the walls were still solid led to some optimism in among the initial gloom. Last night, he said he was \u0026ldquoopen minded about holding a public inquiry, but insisted there first needed to be more clarity about how the fire started.  So what was it that was so special about The Mack? In my eyes, it was like the most charismatic lover you\u0027d ever been with \u0026ndash or never been with. I\u0027d have given anything to have been one of the thousands of students who passed through these magical swing doors in Mackintosh\u0027s famous elongated art nouveau script with the words ART (on the in door) and SCHOOL (on the out door).  I visited it as a sixteen-year-old and fell in love on the spot with the place. How could I not, with these doors and that library? When I went home to Ayrshire and told my normally mild-mannered dad I wanted to apply to get go to this magical place, he swiftly put the kibosh on the idea. \"But how would you get a job as an artist,\" he spluttered?  As it turned out, getting a job as anything in the 1980s was going to be hard but if my subsequent degree in English and Scottish Literature had any use, it led me (eventually) into writing about art. And that meant I got to visit The Mack as an almost-insider.  As one alumni and former member of GSA\u0027s management staff wrote to me in the wee sma\u0027 hours of June 16: \"We all smoked in the building and had done so for decades. Stamping cigarettes out on timber floors surrounded by white spirit. Rennie, the librarian, was a chronic chain smoker in his wee office in the library. Maybe this is too much information, but I\u0027m probably one of many who made love in the building. This latest news is death.\"  The fixtures and fittings rescued from the last fire at GSA remain off-site. Its beautiful library had been rebuilt and is sitting in a warehouse in Edinburgh. Like a confused child piece waiting for a home.  I sent the painter Alison Watt a message last night asking her what one thing she\u0027d like to tell The Mack.  Almost instantly, she wrote back: \"You continue to live inside all of us who love you.\""},{"url":null,"title":"stereophonics-to-kick-off-trnsmt-festival","story":"              Scotland\u0026rsquos biggest music festival will kick off on Friday with performances by the Stereophonics and James Bay.

The SNP Government yesterday announced it was giving the money to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited (FMEL), despite questions over its financial disclosures.  Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the money would provide \u0026ldquoworking capital for the Clyde shipbuilder alongside private investment intended to help diversify the business.  The Port Glasgow yard was acquired by billionaire Jim McColl, a member of the First Minister\u0026rsquos Council of Economic Advisers, after it went into administration in 2014.  However it has been flagged on the Companies House website for not yet filing its annual accounts for 2016, which were due by September 2017.  The most recent public accounts are for the year ending December 2015.  Its immediate parent company, Ferguson Marine Engineering (Holdings) Ltd, is also nine months overdue filing its annual accounts, according to the Companies House website.  Ferguson Marine last night said it had an approval for late filing, but did not explain why it needed it - extensions are normally granted for events outwith a company\u0026rsquos control.  There is no public record of a late filing approval on the Companies House website. Both firms are ultimately owned by Mr McColl\u0026rsquos Clyde Blowers empire.  Green MSP John Finnie said: \u0026ldquoTransparency is vital when public funds are concerned, and this substantial loan must be held up to scrutiny.  \u0026ldquoShip servicing and repair, low carbon marine projects and decommissioning work are all very worthy but it\u0026rsquos clearly a concern if public funds are being used to support a company with a chequered history.  Mr Mackay said one of Mr McColl\u0026rsquos investment vehicles, Clyde Blowers Capital, would also invest alongside the loan to diversify the yard\u0026rsquos work.  Mr McColl recently spoke of expanding into green energy.  The year after Mr McColl acquired Ferguson\u0026rsquos it won a \u0026pound97m contract to build two new \u0026lsquodual fuel\u0026rsquo ferries for government-owned CalMac, securing work for the 150 staff.  However the contract has not gone smoothly, with the first vessel delayed from May this year to the winter, despite Mr McColl assuring ministers in early 2017 that it would be on time.  Ferguson Marine finance director Tom Cousins said: \u0026ldquoThis loan will allow us to accelerate our diversification into areas of innovation in green energy and marine transport and other opportunities such as decommissioning, on which where we are well-place to capitalise.  \u0026ldquoWe have approval from Companies House for the extension on the filing of our accounts. This was not a government bail-out. The investment alongside Clyde Blowers Capital is to support continued diversification.  Mr Mackay said: \u0026ldquoCommercial shipbuilding on the Clyde has a long and proud history, and it is essential that we continue to support this important industry and help it reach its full potential.  \u0026ldquoThis investment allows FMEL to further diversify their business by moving into innovative areas, like low-carbon marine projects, and target decommissioning work.  \u0026ldquoThe loan is a strategic investment in our industrial capability as both the marine engineering sector and commercial shipbuilding have vital roles to play in Scotland\u0026rsquos future."},{"url":null,"title":"plea-for-images-of-mackintosh-blaze-to-help-investigators","story":"              An appeal has been launched for images of the blaze which ripped through Glasgow School of Art\u0026rsquos Mackintosh building.

Now it seems flocks of tourists have their sights set on Scotland\u0026rsquos other island beauty spots.  New figures show the Outer Hebrides has seen a staggering tourism boom, with a 54 per cent jump in leisure visitors since 2013.  The 2017 Islands Visitor Survey reveals tourism is now worth nearly \u0026pound65m a year to the Western Isles, with visitors spending a third more per head than they did just five years ago.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspOutlander brings \u0027phenomenal\u0027 tourism surge  Last year there were almost 220,000 visitors to the islands, 68 per cent of them holidaymakers who spent an average of \u0026pound344 each during their visit.  But while 82 per cent said they were \u0026ldquovery satisfied with their visit, citing friendly locals and high-quality accommodation, the lack of adequate digital connections such as mobile phone signals received a \u0026lsquothumbs down\u0026rsquo from travellers.  The findings have sparked calls for new investment in infrastructure to help maximise the tourism boost, and a fresh focus on ferry services to help maximise the potential.  Ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne recently warned that challenges with its ageing fleet could lead to widespread summer disruption, with Western Isles routes already hit by problems. A Transport Scotland study into the future of ferry links for the Western Isles is currently underway. Its findings are expected at the end of the year.  Comhairle Leader, Cllr Roddie MacKay, said: \u0026ldquoThe findings of this survey are very welcome and encouraging. However, in order to sustain and develop the success of the tourism industry, the islands require excellent transportation links, not only for the economy but for the people who live and work here.  \u0026ldquoWe need to particularly look at the robustness and the capacity of the ferry services to maximise the potential that tourism offers for the islands.  AGENDA:\u0026nbspBrexit talks must address the issue of tourism  The leap in Western Isles tourism appears to reflect the dramatic rise in visitors to other island destinations such as Skye. Roads there were clogged with summer visitors last summer, sparking debate over whether the island had reached saturation point and leading to calls for greater investment in infrastructure and the possible introduction of a tourist tax.  According to Norma Macritchie, assistant manager at the County Hotel in Stornoway, Lewis is already approaching capacity during the peak of summer, with many visitors who attempt to reach the island being turned away before they arrive.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos been a real increase in phone calls from people who want to book, but we are full year on year. \u0026ldquoWe have to tell visitors to go elsewhere.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a real need for investment but it has to be balanced. There\u0026rsquos no point spending a lot of money for visitors who are only here from May until September, she added.  The 2017 Islands Visitor Survey showed 19 per cent of Western Isles visitors were there for business, while a further 12 per cent were visiting friends and relatives. The average spend per capita of visitors was \u0026pound309, up from \u0026pound245 in 2013, and was higher among leisure visitors.  Overall the estimated value from tourism spend in the Outer Hebrides in 2017 of \u0026pound64.5m - and increase of 20 per cent from \u0026pound53.5m in 2013.

The quality of local food produce, arts and crafts also received praise.  While 55 per cent of visitors travelled from elsewhere in Scotland, 28 per cent were from the rest of the UK, 16 per cent from Europe and North America accounted for six per cent.  The figures could be boosted if plans for a Scottish Islands Passport scheme gather pace.

The organisation, whose members include Argyll and Bute, Highland, Orkney and Western Isles councillors, has aid it hopes to emulate the success of Ireland\u0027s Wild Atlantic Way. It is the world\u0027s longest defined coastal touring route, and has a passport scheme.

Fran Healy, who studied fine art at the Glasgow School of Art before rising to fame as a singer and songwriter in Travis, said the elegance of Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0027s plans would mean a re-build would not be impossible.  He spoke to The Herald as a new petition was launched to urge the rebuilding of the \u0027Mack\u0027, which is to be partially dismantled following a second disastrous fire.  He said: \"It\u0027s been horrible to watch the Mac burn and now be pulled down but it\u0027s a building, one of the UK\u0027s best, it\u0027s insured, they have all the drawings and laser scans of every interior, and it\u0027s a very simple build.  \"No intricate angels to re-carve or elaborate structural engineering to backward engineer.  \"That was the beauty of the Mac. It was simple. Like a giant dove tail joint.\"  Mr Healy, however, suggested that the new building, if constructed, could be modernised.  He added: \"I do think this time they should fit a functioning sprinkler system.  \"I don\u0027t think Charles Rennie Mackintosh would feel this interfered with the integrity of the original.\"  Healy is one of many alumni of the GSA and admirers of the building who has expressed the desire for a new version of the world famous building to be created.  The lauded painter Alison Watt and Turner Prize winner Martin Boyce have also said it should be rebuilt, while a new petition, backing the idea to \"Faithfully rebuild the Mackintosh Building\" has garnered hundreds of names within hours.  Boyce told Frieze magazine: \"We have an architect and a building and it\u0026rsquos one of the greatest.  \"It is crystal clear to me that the building must be rebuilt. This moment, the fires and the voices around this issue are just a blip in history. What matters is that in 20 or 50 years from now people can push open those swing doors, walk in and study art in the Mack.\"  The petition says: \"It is still too early to say what damage the structure has undergone, but we hope that, in time, plans can be put in place to save and restore as much as possible, and to rebuild the remainder.  \"Irrespective of how much has been lost, the undersigned support the decision to reinstate this masterpiece like for like.\"  It adds: \"We have faith in the knowledge of the restoration team which has been hard at work since 2014: faith in the skills of the artisans and craftspeople who have been restoring the building and faith in the people of Glasgow who wish to see the building emerge from the ashes.\"  Sir John Leighton, the director general of the National Galleries of Scotland said \"we must do all we can to ensure that the school can thrive in the future.\"  He said: \"The nation is still reeling from the news of the second fire in the great Mackintosh building but there is also a growing determination across the country to do everything possible to support the Glasgow School of Art in the aftermath of this terrible event. \"Generations of graduates from GSA have had a massive impact both at home and abroad \u0026ndash many now rank as world-class artists and are represented in the national collection.  \"I cannot emphasize enough how important GSA is to the cultural fabric of Scotland and we must do all we can to ensure that the school can thrive in the future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"unspun-the-political-diary","story":"              THE reshuffle kerfuffle prompted an unusually sombre performance from Tory MSP Jackson Carlaw.

Brussels, you have been warned.  MEANWHILE robot prefect Ash Denham became minister for community safety. Besides representing Edinburgh Eastern while living in the Borders, and axing her Regan-Denham double barrel, the pseudo-lefty is best known for her pedagogical passion. \u0026ldquoEducation is not a commodity to be bought or sold! she railed in her maiden speech as an MSP. A noble sentiment only slightly undermined by Ms Denham buying her own kids an education at private school.  PROMOTION, too, for bearded sage Michael Russell, but on what evidence? Although known as Brexit minister in his past role, his full title was actually Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland\u0026rsquos Place in Europe. Rather awkwardly, those negotiations ended with Scotland heading out of Europe. Now he\u0026rsquos Constitutional Relations Secretary. Presumably relations with the UK will now deteriorate beyond repair.  THE most brutal bit of the reshuffle came not when Ms Sturgeon was culling ministers, but praising them. She poured warm words on Keith Brown, Angela Constance and Shona Robison. But then she turned to the \u0026lsquobonfire of the nobodies\u0026rsquo, and the sacking of Alasdair Allan, Annabelle Ewing and Maureen \u0026lsquo15\u0026rsquo Watt.

It\u0026rsquos been nearly two decades since Mike Watson, one of Labour\u0026rsquos original intake of MSPs proposed to outlaw fox-hunting.It might have helped his cause if this was a major issue in his constituency. I\u0026rsquom not sure, though, if the plight of foxes is anywhere near the top of any list of social priorities in Castlemilk, that sturdy and edgy neighbourhood on Glasgow\u0026rsquos southern uplands.  Watson\u0026rsquos vulpine intervention was an early marker for political stupidity at Holyrood and one that generations of his colleagues in Scottish Labour have seemed eager to emulate. In recent years they have re-written the playbook on political ineptitude. This is a party that was ill-equipped to meet the demands of devolution and the enhanced expectations of the Scottish electorate. That much was clear from the outset when the Scottish Labour establishment opted to rule out so-called trouble-makers such as the charismatic Dennis Canavan from its preferred list of potential MSPs.  In came an assortment of placemen and party worthies who had done little more than keep their heads down and their noses clean. When genuine talent did emerge such as Wendy Alexander and Susan Deacon they were forced to cut short their political careers by a combination of shady, in-house political machinations and a lack of support. Complacency and a sense of entitlement in traditional Labour constituencies blinded them to the threat of the SNP. The Nationalists began working the doorsteps as the Labour old guard remained inert in their Westminster drinking clubs.  The unthinkable became the inevitable as the SNP came to power in 2007 and then achieved the seemingly impossible landslide in 2011 that was the gateway to an independence referendum. It was during this campaign that Labour in Scotland first exhibited traces of Einstein\u0026rsquos theory on madness. The breadth of a cigarette paper couldn\u0026rsquot separate Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos high command from the Tories during the referendum with people like Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling and Jim Murphy going the full British bulldog and losing a generation of voters in the process.  Mr Murphy became leader and effectively finished the party as a serious electoral force. By the time this became official with third place at the 2016 Holyrood election, it was clear to his successor, Kezia Dugdale, that the process of dilapidation had reached such an advanced stage that she also resigned. After a decade in the wilderness, it seemed at last that the party in Scotland might have come to acknowledge the delusions of the recent past.  It elected Richard Leonard as its leader, a trade unionist and that rare thing among senior Scottish Labour figures, someone who seemed to be in tune with authentic, old-school socialism that had emancipated British working people and improved their lives. His call for the provision of elderly care to be nationalised and thus liberated from the get-rich-quick exploiters and speculators was a welcome one. In electing Mr Leonard the party chose to reject the pretensions of his rival, Anas Sarwar, a decent enough chiel but one whose depth of commitment to the party can be measured in direct proportion to the height of his personal ambitions.  When it was revealed during the leadership campaign that his family firm didn\u0026rsquot recognise a trade union and failed to pay its lowest-paid employees the Living Wage his bid to be leader was effectively over. This hasn\u0026rsquot stopped his closest party associates from seeking to destabilise Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos leadership. Thus the party finds itself consumed in a civil war that is not in its best wider interests and that could extinguish all hope of any kind of electoral comeback in Scotland.  The fate of the so-called and ridiculously self-styled \u0026ldquoAberdeen Nine is the weapon by which this vociferous faction has chosen to damage Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos leadership. The \u0026ldquonine are Labour councillors in Aberdeen who have chosen to prop up a Conservative administration on Aberdeen City Council by working in a coalition with them to keep the SNP, the largest party on the council, out of office. For this they were rightly suspended by Ms Dugdale. They have since refused to back down and now face expulsion.  There are some red Labour lines that form the basic conduct party members expect of their elected representatives. First is: Thou shalt not give succour and support to any Tory administration (and certainly not one run by the most reactionary and right-wing Westminster parties in living memory).  Laughably, some of these self-important Labour councillors have advanced the view that their Tory masters on the council are decent coves and quite progressive, really. I hae ma doots.  The petition to defend the \u0026ldquoAberdeen Nine was launched by Professor Hugh Pennington, a man who has wrapped himself tightly in the Union flag.  Astonishingly, a raft of senior Labour figures in Scotland has chosen to back the nine. They must know that many former Labour supporters were among those who returned the SNP as the largest party in the Aberdeen council elections. Do they really think they have the slightest chance of getting them back by indulging these cranks?  Of course, this isn\u0026rsquot really about the councillors at all. Rather it bears all the hallmarks of a right-wing coup against Mr Leonard orchestrated mainly by those figures who almost destroyed Labour in Scotland. As such, it isn\u0026rsquot about Labour values (how could it be?) it\u0026rsquos about thwarted personal ambition.  Mr Leonard needs to act decisively in this and expel the \u0026ldquoAberdeen Nine immediately and without referring the decision to London. Then he needs to act with similar ruthlessness in rooting out his enemies closer to home. It\u0026rsquos the first big test of his leadership."},{"url":null,"title":"teachers-pupils-guessing-answers-to-tests-because-they-are-too-hard","story":"              PUPILS are \u0026ldquoguessing their way through new national standardised tests because they are too difficult, teachers have warned.  The suggestion is contained in a range of views gathered by the Scottish Government following the introduction of the assessments.  One of the responses, released under freedom of information legislation, states: \u0026ldquoSome children became uninterested and just started to click random answers, particularly in the reading and writing assessments. We noted children who it was apparent were guessing. One child did exceptionally well with his guesses.  Another said: \u0026ldquoThe majority of the children just guessed at the answers, not giving a true reflection of their ability.  A third teacher noted there was a \u0026ldquosuspicion that guessing got a lot of children through.  Others highlighted the difficulty of the assessments for children in P1 in both numeracy and literacy.  One teacher said: \u0026ldquoMany questions in the numeracy are beyond the expected stage for them with language they are still unfamiliar with.  \u0026ldquoIn literacy, the texts they are expected to read on their own are way beyond anything we would expect at that stage.  The feedback comes after the Scottish Government introduced new standardised national assessments for all pupils in P1, P4, P7 and S3.  The tests were introduced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics argue the move to test pupils, particularly in the first year of primary school, is counterproductive.  One of the responses suggested some teachers were ignoring the assessments completely.  It said: \u0026ldquoOne school chose not to do P1s since the children were not ready for it and didn\u0026rsquot have capacity to do it.  There were concerns over the length of time the assessments took, which can be as much as 50 minutes, as well the level of computer skills required.  One teacher said: \u0026ldquoP1 pupils need good competent keyboard skills to complete the assessments, such as click and drag, do not double click and scroll.  Another added: \u0026ldquoSome children were overwhelmed by the length of the tests.  \u0026ldquoSome pupils in P4 became upset during the assessments despite reassurances. Therefore were given breaks to support.  There were also concerns about the different approaches taken in different schools.  One response said: \u0026ldquoSome teachers have read aloud passages to the children and then they have answered the questions.  \u0026ldquoIf some teachers are reading passages to children and others are not, how will the results be truly realistic?  However, there was also positive feedback on the tests, with one teacher of 17 years\u0026rsquo experience saying: \u0026ldquoPupils in my schools where I facilitated these assessments all enjoyed doing them. There was no stress involved as it was not built up into anything high stakes beforehand.  \u0026ldquoI love to see them so engaged and trying their best. I also find the information invaluable to my teaching and the pupils\u0026rsquo learning.  Another said: \u0026ldquoMost children found it quite enjoyable. No-one was particularly distressed by it."},{"url":null,"title":"arlene-foster-to-attend-orange-order-parade-in-fife","story":"              Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster is expected to attend an Orange Order parade in Scotland.

In particular, the Brick by Brick initiative, which has been a fantastic platform to engage local companies and schools in some fun and creative fundraising. By buying a brick for the extension they are quite literally helping us build brighter futures for people in their community.“Of course, our residents have been involved in the appeal too, with one recently taking part in the Aberdeen Kiltwalk with her family, whilst other residents have encouraged their friends and family to undertake challenges, such as the Great Aberdeen Run.

Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

Universal Credit is simplifying the system and revolutionising welfare by making work pay. It also helps those who are in work to increase their hours and earnings.                                                     Universal Credit replaces six benefits with one monthly payment and is already being claimed by single jobseekers. And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.

The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment. With the application process now completely online, Universal Credit streamlines the system, making benefits simpler to navigate and easier to understand.

He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision. However, he is confident there will still be opportunities for Wick harbour to get work in the Moray Firth area.MORL spokesman Craig Milroy said Wick was in the running for the O\u0026ampM base along with Buckie and Fraserburgh. A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it.

We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

The crew also carried out maintenance work on lights and lanterns.As time went by the vessel was employed in the conversion of automated lighthouses to solar panel operation. When this work was completed in 1996, the ship was taken out of service.An initiative was later launched to preserve the vessel as a floating cultural monument.This ship is representative of a type of specialised vessel from a unique period in the history of Norwegian lighthouses and is open to the public today, Wednesday, afternoon 2pm-6pm, the again from 10am-Noon and 2pm \u0026#8211 6pm on Thursday.More details about the visit of the ship in The Orcadian next week.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is simply not acceptable.Whatever the outstanding disagreement there may be between the government and commercial operators, Mr McArthur feels that people in Orkney have every right to expect both sides to get this sorted without delay.\u0026#8220The Transport Secretary also needs to confirm that the fare reductions, once agreed, will be backdated to 30 June, in keeping with the firm promises made by his predecessor and the First Minister,\u0026#8221 he said.“This sorry saga has rumbled on for far too long.

Blind from the age of seven as the result of smallpox, the legendary Blind Piper was a pupil of the great MacCrimmon of Skye, going on to compose perhaps the finest piobaireachd ever.The aim of the festival is to encourage pipers under the age of 18 to participate in friendly and relaxing competitions. Chairman Ian Blake of Aultgrishan said it was an exciting setting for competitors and \"will provide visitors to the gardens with a unique opportunity to hear some of the most gifted young inheritors of our much cherished Highland heritage\".

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Saturday 30 Jun 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

However as soon as he was able, he was back in the saddle.The supermarket worker was delighted with his recent racing success followed by his selection for the GB squad for the world championships at the end of July and beginning of August.\"I really wanted to retain the national title but this year I knew I had my work cut out as I was up against my friend and main competitor Ben Watson who is a full time GB rider,\" he said.\"It was a great race. I felt good going into it and was able to counter any attacks and came down to a sprint where I was able to take the win.\"The news got better when British Cycling announced the world championship squad for this year with my name on it. I\u0026rsquom really looking forward to pulling on the GB kit for the first time.\"The hard work is paying off and I am hoping this is a stepping stone towards becoming a full-time GB rider. I\u0026rsquom really happy at being given this opportunity, being only 18 years old.\"He said the last eight months had only been possible thanks to the generosity of Moray Estates in paying for all his training and racing travel costs.He also thanked Tesco Dingwall which had been flexible with his shifts, allowing him to travel to races.Last year\u0026rsquos Strathpuffer 24-hour endurance event raised \u0026pound1000 to be divided between Fin and the charity Lupus UK.Saturday 30 Jun 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762088.1530298886!/image/image.jpg","title":"stephen jardine my road to damascus moment about barbecues","story":"\t\tThe recent sunshine has finally won me over to delights of outdoor cooking, writes Stephen Jardine.\t\t\t\tTime to eat some humble pie. Four weeks ago, I consigned the great Scottish barbeque to the bin with the following words. “By June the rain has started and everything related to outdoor eating gets heavily discounted as the realisation dawns, well that’s it for another year.” What a difference a month makes. As the great Bruce Lee once said: “Mistakes are always forgivable, if you have the courage to admit them.”            When it comes to barbeques, it turns out I was very, very wrong. At the root of my despair was a catalogue of miserable, soggy attempts to eat outdoors. So often you start the day with the best of intentions but end it huddled under an umbrella undercooking sausages surrounded by the smell of lighter fluid while your guests hide indoors near a radiator. Well, not this summer.            READ MORE: Stephen Jardine: The Great Scottish Barbecue ConspiracyAs soon as I wrote the piece, the clouds cleared and the sun started splitting the sky. It’s been like that more or less ever since and the great Scottish barbeque has at last had a chance to shine. Until now I couldn’t fathom why you would choose a rusty grill over a well-equipped, hygienic kitchen. The difference is sunshine. I’ve probably cooked and eaten outside more in the past four weeks than I have in the past four years and, at long last, I get the attraction. With the sun beating down, a barbeque fills the garden with the promising smell of great food to come. It also allows you to stay outside, sipping a wine or beer while you cook rather than becoming a martyr in the kitchen as everyone else enjoys the good weather.Then there is the food itself. As the sunny days have turned into weeks, we’ve had time to become ambitious. Beyond the burgers and sausages, there are sardines to sear, steaks to sizzle and pineapples to pop on the coals with cinnamon and brown sugar. Understandably, DIY centres report booming sales of barbeques and outdoor furniture but they are not the only ones experiencing a sunshine dividend. Ice-cream sellers are struggling to keep up with demand and gin sales are also said to be up as people enjoy long drinks in the sun. However the soft drinks market is facing a challenge.             READ MORE: Tom Kitchin: Barbecue recipesAlong with brewers, it is suffering because of a European shortage of carbon dioxide. CO2 production problems forced pub chain JD Wetherspoon to suspend some beer sales while Coca-Cola is pausing some production. The situation is also affecting some food packaging and poultry and pig production.Things are expected to get back to normal next week and, for those planning a barbeque with spare ribs, chicken legs and a cold beer, that can only be good news. In general terms this remarkable weather is good for most in the food and drink sector but spare a thought for Tesco staff in Devon who have had to cope with an influx of bare-chested, male customers. Following complaints from other customers, Tesco has now banned topless men from shopping in stores. A man in an inappropriate vest was also turned away. When it comes to barbeques, I’m now a convert and happy to admit I was wrong. But surely we can all agree, topless men in Tesco is never alright, regardless of the weather."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762144.1530348395!/image/image.jpg","title":"alex salmond the vow did swing the indyref result","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...\t\tAlex Salmond has called into question a claim made by the former editor of the Daily Record that The Vow was not responsible for the No campaign winning the 2014 independence referendum. \t\t\t\tThe former First Minister welcomed Murray Foote as “a new recruit to the independence cause” after he came out in support of separation this month.

Although a major study three years ago found it did not change the result of the vote, it led to the creation of the Smith Commission and the devolution of significant new powers to Scotland. Mr Foote, who stood down as editor of the Record in March, said his motivation for publishing the pledge was to ensure the politicians kept to their word. He added there was no evidence it lost the campaign for Yes which he believed failed because the economic case for independence was not strong enough.READ MORE: SNP put IndyRef2 ahead of vote on Brexit deal            However, Mr Salmond remains convinced The Vow had an impact on the vote. He said: “I warmly welcome Murray Foote as a new recruit to the independence cause but he heavily underrates the significance of the Vow which was a journalistic masterpiece but politically disabled Scotland at a crucial moment.“It presented a No campaign then in total disarray with a rallying point in the final week of the 2014 referendum. “The Daily Record provided an infinitely more credible vehicle than George Osborne and the Tory Government who first wanted to proffer the panicked promise of more powers.”            He added: “The votes that drifted back to No in the final days of the campaign were mostly older Labour inclined voters to whom Gordon Brown and The Record still spoke to with some authority and of course offering people an apparently easier path can always be presented as attractive in a climate of fear mongering. “It only needed to influence one in 20 of the population to swing the vote and I think it did just that.”Mr Foote admitted that an independent Scotland would face “financial challenges” in the years after a Yes vote. “The difficult decisions our independent nation would face and the sacrifices we may need to make do trouble me,” he wrote. His decision to back separation was welcomed by Nicola Sturgeon, who said she was “delighted” to hear of his change of heart."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762099.1530302839!/image/image.jpg","title":"may faces cabinet showdown over brexit as eu door left ajar for deal","story":"\t\tTheresa May has been issued a \u0026#8220last call\u0026#8221 for her government to agree what kind of Brexit deal it wants after EU leaders left a summit in Brussels voicing concern at the lack of progress and warning that is running out.\t\t\t\tEU Council President Donald Tusk told the Prime Minister to “lay the cards on the table”, while EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier offered to restart formal Brexit talks as early as Monday, saying “time is very short”.            Brussels must wait until a cabinet meeting at Chequers next Thursday, however, to see whether Mrs May can get ministers to back a single proposal on future trade that will meet EU demands and be acceptable to Brexiteers in government.            German Chancellor Angela Merkel revealed that the Prime Minister will come to Berlin to sell whatever deal she reaches with her ministers after the Chequers showdown.The next gathering of EU leaders in October is effectively the last chance to present an agreement on the UK’s future relationship with Brussels, covering the thorny issue of customs arrangements and how they will prevent a hard border in Ireland.At the end of the two-day meeting in Brussels, EU leaders took minutes to agree a joint statement expressing “concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland”.In a press conference concluding the summit, Mr Tusk warned that “the most difficult tasks are still unresolved”.“If we want to reach a deal in October we need quick progress,” he said. “This is the last call to lay the cards on the table.”            Ministers will be asked at Chequers to agree a white paper setting out the UK’s proposals for the future trading relationship.The government’s two existing proposals, for a “customs partnership” and technology-based system for monitoring the flow of goods, have been rejected by the EU, leaving only a “backstop” proposal that Northern Ireland effectively remain in the single market and customs union – an arrangement that would be politically unacceptable in the UK, not least to Mrs May’s DUP allies.Suggestions that the UK could stay in the EU single market for trade in goods alone has also been dismissed, prompting speculation that the Prime Minister will have to offer major concessions on the free movement of people to secure a deal. Mr Barnier told journalists in Brussels: “We are waiting for the UK white paper and I hope it will contain workable and realistic proposals but let me mention once again that the time is very short... I’m ready to invite the UK and the delegation to come back and present next Monday.”The Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar, who said he was shown passages of the draft white paper, insisted there would be no “cherry picking” of aspects of the single market. “While we regret them leaving we are not going to let them destroy it,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al.

The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

If they have a good business case they should have no problem is raising the necessary funds for the venture.\nI would suggest that people interested in the Travelodge empire google Travelodge owners .  It quickly becomes evident that it is a huge money making business which is definitely not in need of financial support from Shetland.  What a nerve these people have.

The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.
