There are feminists who often don’t realise or can’t relate to the fact that for women of colour, of different faiths, abilities, it’s not just gender that they’re discriminated on.Muslim women are affected by things Muslim men aren’t (Picture: MMUFFIN for )Such women are affected by these circumstances professionally, socially, and mentally and yet don’t always receive the help and support that’s needed.Issues are all too often seen through white lenses and how they affect white women, such as the gender pay gap, sexual harassment, eating disorders, and everyday sexism.We don’t see many platforms which seek out Muslim women’s experiences of these topics.Think of the countless articles, research pieces, features that looked at sexual assault, post #MeToo how many of those included Muslim women’s stories? Given the wide scope of women affected by sexual misconduct, there were definitely Muslim women who were affected, so why have we not heard any of their voices?There are many discussions about the age we should have sex education, for example, but do we ever see Muslim women be given a platform to discuss when they think it’s a good idea?The problem is that a large chunk of western, 21st-century feminism seems to be white feminism (meaning feminists who prioritise topical issues that affect white women and exclude the experiences of women of colour). And that’s because white voices are amplified the most when it comes to women’s issues, or given a white facerepresentative of it.I don’t say that lightly. Of course there are the intersectional ones, the comrades, the ones who get it, but they’re rare and few.Some Muslim women think western feminism is out of tune with Muslim women’s lives and choices that they find the whole concept tone deaf and unappealing.Nooreen tells : ‘Some (Muslim) women still aren’t pro-feminism because of internalised misogyny and some just accept how society has laid rules down for women.’Meanwhile, Rima says that she believes Islam is already a feminist religion and that Muslims don’t need to subscribe to a separate ideology when Islam incorporates women’s rights.‘I think Islam is a feminist faith if people were to understand it properly. Women in Islam have always been the torchbearers.’Someone like me, who doesn’t wear a headscarf, might be accepted into mainstream feminist circles in our shared fight to deconstruct the patriarchy. That’s partly because the headscarf is seen as a patriarchal imposition.Iman, who also doesn’t wear a hijab, feels the same way.She tells : ‘I feel like someone who looks like me would be more welcome in feminist circles (if you exclude my blackness, which is a whole other story) than a woman in niqab.‘I think like many other things in the west, a lot of political and social movements have been defined through a white-centric lens, and feminism is the same, that makes it difficult for anyone who is classified as non-whitemiddle classeducated to fit in.‘Personally, I feel like feminism is about choice – and covering is a part of that.‘Ultimately, the aim should be that all women feel comfortable expressing themselves that is authentic to them and makes them happy without feeling the need to explain themselves.’We need to be intersectional in our celebration of women (Picture: Ella Byworth for )Feminism often feels like it only accepts those who look like they subscribe to its ideals. Someone in a burkaniqab isn’t seen as having agency therefore is pitied or only accepted if their fight is against the religious imposition.A Muslim woman who not only wears a headscarf, but a burka, a niqab, andor who has conservative views about sex and sexuality is not usually accepted into feminist groups as easily because the idea is that Islam is inherently oppressive and the only way to be liberated is to become more liberal and that’s usually synonymous with ‘western’.But Muslim women shouldn’t need to conform to western ideals and show that they’re Muslim but they’re not that religious, that they date against their parents’ will, that they’re sexually liberated, to be accepted.opinionWhy are there so few blue plaques for women?Muslim women shouldn’t need to water down religion and culture to be accepted. Why should we as feminists only unite because of commonality? Yes, Muslims don’t believe in sex before marriage, we believe in modesty (for both men and women), we live in patriarchal communities (which society doesn’t?) and Muslim men are allowed to marry four times  (if they can live by its terms and conditions). These things might not scream freedom and agency to a lot of people, but it works for Muslims, some of it doesn’t. Muslims are not a monolith and you’ll come across every type under the sun, the point is, people should be equally receptive of a person, no matter what their beliefs.The western feminist movement should be able to deal with the idea that some women believe in things that might otherwise contradict their idea of feminist thought, like the headscarf.If we’re supposed to be all about choice and letting women (and also men) do what they want with their bodies, why do we have a problem when they want to cover it up? Sure, not all women are afforded the luxury of choice and not all have agency, we should support them too. But some choose to cover up, to obey God.Many women are empowered by hijab, by religion, and these women need to have their narrative accepted.One woman might want to become a homemaker, another might want to be a sex worker. One girl might grow up, waiting her whole life wanting to get married. And maybe one of them wants to serve God and be a nun or a Muslim. Let’s accept them all.The point is, let’s support and stand for all kinds of women, even the ones who choose to do things you don’t agree with, as long as they’re not hurting themselves or anyone else.And no, believing in God, if done properly, is not hurting anyone.MORE: Islam has been therapeutic for my mental health, I don’t care what people have to sayMORE: Does veganism go against Muslim beliefs?MORE: Why there’s so much silence around being sexually assaulted in the Asian community"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/885622646-e1525866795412.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"fka twigs six tumours size cooking apples removed uterus","story":"FKA twigs has undergone surgery (Picture: Jeff SpicerBFCGetty Images)FKA twigs has revealed she underwent surgery to have multiple tumours removed from her uterus.The 30-year-old singer was left in ‘excruciating’ pain due to six fibroid tumours on his uterus, with two growing to the size of cooking apples.Twigs, real name Tahliah Debrett Barnett, shared an Instagram video of herself performing a stunning poledancing routine, and in the caption, told fans she was recovering from surgery.She wrote: ‘Dear friends, I am a very private person as u all know and I have gone back and forth in my mind whether to share that this year I have been recovering from laparoscopic surgery to remove 6 fibroid tumours from my uterus. the tumours were pretty huge, the size of 2 cooking apples 🍎 🍎, 3 kiwis 🥝 🥝 🥝 and a couple of 🍓🍓.‘A fruit bowl of pain everyday. the nurse said that the weight and size was like being 6 months pregnant.‘I tried to be brave but it was excruciating at times and to be honest I started to doubt if my body would ever feel the same again.’Twigs continued: ‘I had surgery in December and I was so scared, despite lots of love from friends and family I felt really alone and my confidence as a woman was knocked.‘But… today whilst dancing with Kelly at the choreography house I felt like my strong self again for the first time in a while and it was magical. thank you precious body for healing, thank you for reminding me to be kind to myself, you are a wonderful thing, now go create and be other once again \u0026lt3Jada Pinkett Smith regrets dating Will Smith while he was marriedFibroids are abnormal growths that develop in or on a woman’s uterus.

I live in a building with an autistic man who has bipolar, he has angry outbursts and last week said something really unkind, he struggles with understanding he’s in the wrong \u0026amp apologising but gave me this today.’‘Sometimes I say things in the heat of the moment I do not always mean.‘I hope you will accept my sorry gifts.‘Love from Christopher.‘P.S. I really do like you and your family and dog.’Ruby tells  that Christopher is normally ‘like a giant teddy bear’.She said: ‘He is mostly very sweet but has his moments where he can be irritable and unkind mainly due to his diagnosis on the autism spectrum and bipolar disorder.(Picture: Ruby King)‘The manager of the service told me Christopher was doing something for me, to give me some warning so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed, so I went about my afternoon of shopping in town and came back around 4pm.‘I am now aware that Christopher walked up to the local supermarket whilst I was out and bought me a card, cookies and a plant.‘He expressed to staff that he was feeling something strange in his stomach, they asked if he was nervous and he said yes, they explained that is called butterflies.‘Staff invited me downstairs to his flat and I went in, he couldn’t make eye contact with me but said here you go and gave me the cards and apology gifts.‘One of the staff was blubbering as this is a very out of character thing for Christopher to do. I read the card and started crying too as I was just so touched, I said to him “I know you hate hugs but tough I’m giving you one”.(Picture: Ruby King)‘So I quickly gave him a hug as he is not a fan of being touched and expressed my gratefulness for his apology and expressed that he didn’t need to have got me gifts, his apology would have been enough but thank you anyway.’According to Ruby, Christopher had seen her gardening a few days prior to the gifts and wanted to go out and join her but felt he couldn’t.She left the flat saying thank you again, as she was feeling very overwhelmed by the whole situation.She continued: ‘The next day I was leaving the building to go to my Grandma’s for the weekend and he shouted me out of his window and waved, of course, I waved back and I haven’t seen him since but everything is all good.‘I forgave him, I understand that it wasn’t him truly speaking, I’ve said things I’ve regretted when I haven’t been in a good frame of mind so I sympathise towards him.’Since sharing her tweet, Ruby has gone viral with more than 35,000 retweets and 230,000 likes.(Picture: Ruby King)She said she’s been absolutely ‘blown away’ by the response, telling us: ‘I had simply put it on to show my friends and followers the sweet gesture, as I share a lot of my life on Twitter as I am a blogger.‘I kept thinking it’s going to die down but as time went on it got crazier, my phone kept crashing I just couldn’t keep up with it.‘Out of thousands and thousands of repliesquoted tweets, I had a handful of negative responses, mainly about sharing his letter online. I chose to share it as there is such a misconception of autism that we are all non-verbal, illiterate and low functioning when that is far from the truth.‘Autism is a spectrum and some of the smartest people in the world are on this spectrum – they just display different difficulties to what people may expect from the stereotype.Ruby adds that soon, she’ll be moving out of her flat and into a more independent service.She would like to keep in touch with Christopher, but it will be difficult as she feels it could cause more harm than good.She tells us: ‘I think me leaving will upset him and if I stayed in touch he wouldn’t be able to move on‘Before I leave I will spend an evening with him, perhaps have a takeaway or go out for the day as I know he will miss my company greatly, as I will his.’MORE: How chronic illness and mental health are inextricably linkedMORE: Photographer’s emotional portraits will make you want to give your grandparents a call"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sei_10610451.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"home office admits people wrongly removed uk last six years","story":"The director general of immigration enforcement also acknowledged that there is a ‘deep problem’ with wrongful immigration detentions.

Her dating experiences inspired her debut novel, Perfect Match. Wednesday 9 May 2018 9:00 am(Picture: Ella Byworth for )Like us or loathe us, the number of vegans is on the rise.According to a recent study, there are now 3.5 million in the UK, and I’m one of them.I went vegan last September after four years as a vegetarian.As a veggie, I couldn’t have cared less whether guys I dated ate meat or not.I had a few wishy-washy notions about animal rights, but I wasn’t that into it.However, as a vegan, I feel very differentlyI haven’t just quietly opted for a plant-based diet. Hell no.I’m the most annoying type of vegan: the militant type.The one who’ll make you watch Cowspiracy on a Friday night and send you emotional memes about slaughterhouses.The one who won’t shut up about how many animals are killed for food every second.Animal rights is now so important to me that I’d struggle to connect with a guy who wasn’t sympathetic.But it’s not just about ethics. It might sound weird, but these days I find the idea of kissing a meat eater unappealing too.A guy could be coming towards me, eyes closed, the moment perfectly sweet, and at the back of my mind, I’d be thinking, ‘What if he has a bit of steak between his teeth?’The thought grosses me out so much that it ruins the romance.You shouldn’t necessarily judge a dating app user based on their food photos (Picture: Ella Byworth for )But it’s not just about kissing.On a practical level, I don’t think I could live with a meat eater.I’d hate to have meat smells in my home and I certainly wouldn’t want to clean animal residue off dishes. Yep, I really am that fussy.But we all know the dating scene is tough. Finding a good guy is like finding a needle in a haystack. Finding a good guy who’s vegan? Well, I may as well just give up now.But then I heard about Grazer – the ‘herbivorous dating app’. Could this be the solution to my single vegan woes? I downloaded it and VeganEyes – a similar app – and got to swiping.Both apps are pretty similar to Tinder. You upload a couple of photos, write a quick bio and you’re good to go. Except that there are hardly any guys on either of them and you never get matches.Before it sounds like I’m blaming the apps for my lack of dateability, let me point out that I’m not usually totally repellent.I’ve never found it too hard to get a date from Tinder, but even when I swiped on everyone and anyone (decades older than me with with a long wizard beard? Sure. Man in full blue Smurf-style body paint? Why not?), I still didn’t get one match.I tried on a few different days for good measure, but the result on both apps was always the same: no matches.I guess even though veganism is on the rise, the population of single vegans fussy enough to only date other vegans is still pretty small.The problem could also be that dating apps are often seen as part of hook-up culture, and when it comes to casual sex, a lot of people, particularly men, probably couldn’t care less whether their conquest is vegan or not.So where does that leave fussy vegans like myself? Aside from dying alone, I think the best bet is to meet vegans in real life.Go to vegan meetups, attend protests and vigils.Meet like-minded friends and expand your social circle. Or date on normal sites and sound people out.They might be a meat eater but open to veganism.The last guy I dated from Tinder had a picture of steak on his Instagram, but from chatting to him I could tell he had a nice character and I thought perhaps he’d be open-minded about veganism.On our first date, I found out that he was in fact in a WhatsApp chat group called the ‘Vgang’ and had cut down to only eating meat one day a week.Maybe one day vegan dating apps will take off, but, sadly, even though the number of vegans is on the rise, I don’t think their time has quite come yet.If you want to improve your cooking skills and learn how to make healthy vegetarian and vegan meals, we have partnered with OfCourse to bring you a selection of courses that can help.To book the Vegan \u0026amp Vegetarian Cooking Made Easy course visit ofcourseMORE: 9 signs the guy you’re dating is already takenMORE: 10 ways to f**k with a f**kboyMORE: Mark Zuckerberg unveils Facebook Dating but says it’s ‘not for hook-ups’MORE: Vegan girl ditches pal after he claims giving blowjob is the same as eating a sausage"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/12/4BF8747000000578-5703293-image-m-23_1525779465935.jpg","title":"Extraordinary snaps joyful Meghan Markle Italian holiday date Prince Harry","story":"    Meghan\u0027s unofficial wedding planner and best friend Jessica Mulroney posted this picture on Instagram in August 2016 – a month after Meghan had her first date with Harry.

Since then they have been to watch a Toronto Blue Jays baseball match together, holidayed in Italy and Meghan has taught Jessica\u0027s daughter to dance.\u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle said. \u0027Meghan adores Jessica, not just as a friend but also as someone whose taste and style are impeccable.

She then launched her own business importing luxury lingerie.After a successful career as a stylist – with her own TV slot – and wedding planner, she was propelled to the A list in 2008 after marrying the eldest son of Brian Mulroney.The couple has three children: twins Brian and John, now seven, and daughter Ivy now four, who are rumoured to be page boys and flower girl at the Royal wedding.Jessica and Meghan bonded over their shared passion for yoga, Pilates, dogs and philanthropy.

She wore a coat by Canadian designer Sentaler and people went crazy for it. We had created this media frenzy, like you see with anything Kate wears.\u0027But it was only after Meghan began dating Prince Harry in 2016 that Mulroney became a global name. It was in her house that the couple sought refuge when news of their relationship broke.Then, last September, as speculation of an engagement reached fever pitch, Mulroney was in a box with Meghan, her mother Doria, and Markus Anderson, for the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games.Harry joined them for the final 20 minutes of the show, standing arm in arm with Meghan and planting a kiss on her check as they watched Bryan Adams sing love songs.And, when Harry and Meghan got engaged last November, Mulroney was credited with orchestrating the outfit – a white wrap coat by The Line, PAROSH green dress and Aquazzura nude pumps.She is also believed to be the brains behind Meghan\u0027s outfits for many of her official engagements and is instrumental in helping her choose her wedding dress.    The relaxed snaps are a far cry from Meghan\u0027s polished appearances with Harry, such as the Anzac Day Service of Commemoration and Thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey last month  The candid photos show just how close the women are as Jessica and Meghan spend time away from the spotlight on holiday  A source close to Maghan has revealed how the friendship has blossomed since their time together in Toronto.  \u0027Jessica helped Meghan with her wardrobe and introduced her to the right people,\u0027 one of their circle saidThe couple had a dress rehearsal on Suits when Jessica helped her choose the Anne Barge Versailles dress from Jessica\u0027s Kleinfeld Canada bridal boutique when her Suits character Rachel Zane was supposed to marry Mike Ross - only for him to leave her at the altar.She flew to London in January to attend the first fitting and was in London in April when Meghan had her final fitting. Mulroney jetted into Heathrow for a \u0027mini hen party\u0027 and was given a sneak preview of the dress and the wedding venue.She has been so successful in helping Meghan create her \u0027effortless chic\u0027 style that Vogue, editor Edward Enninful believes she could eclipse the Duchess of Cambridge. \u0027Ms Markle is an astonishing fashion sales force, who is setting the industry alight,\u0027 he said recently.A royal source said: \u0027Jessica is Meghan\u0027s BFF (best friend forever) and has been a huge influence.

Regardless, USGS scientists expect fissures to keep spewing.The lava could eventually be channeled to one powerful vent while others go dormant, as has happened in some previous Hawaii eruptions, Stovall said.Kilauea, one of the world\u0027s most active volcanoes, has been erupting continuously since 1983.The USGS\u0027s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory issued a notice in mid-April that there were signs of pressure building in underground magma, and a new vent could form on the cone or along what\u0027s known as the East Rift Zone.

It\u0027s been a long time coming, but maybe we can turn the page on class lists for now.\u0027In a tight vote, the fellows of Regent House, which include academics and other key figures, approved the call for students to have the opportunity to opt out from having their names and exam results published in the class lists.          Cambridge is the only university in Britain to publicly display class lists after Oxford abolished them in 2009. Pictured: The Senate House and Kings College (left)Class lists are currently posted on notice boards outside Senate House, published in the Cambridge University Reporter, and are also published online.In the vote, 412 members of Regent House voted in favour, with 391 against, it was revealed today in Varsity, the university\u0027s in-house newspaper.Graham Virgo, pro-vice-chancellor for education said: \u0027I welcome the result of the ballot which means that all students are now able to choose to opt out from having their names published outside the Senate House or in the Reporter.\u0027This opt out will be implemented immediately. Faculties, departments and colleges will still have access to the full class list for their own internal purposes.\u0027Previously, students could only opt out in exceptional circumstances, after a lengthy, bureaucratic process, and only 86 names were omitted last year.   Campaigners at the university, which has about 21,000 students from all round the world, claimed having their result made public for all to see could affect the mental health of some people.They said the lists are \u0027damaging\u0027 to welfare, can trigger depression and \u0027promote a culture of naming and shaming\u0027.But supporters said it would be sad if a tradition dating back nearly 300 years was abolished.  Until now, applications from students wanting to have their names removed are only considered in \u0027exceptional circumstances. Under the new system, every student can simply tick a box which states they wish to opt out. Martha Krish, students\u0027 union education officer, said last year that the lists had caused \u0027distress and harm\u0027 to countless students and the new system was \u0027a massive improvement\u0027. Oxford University has kept exam results private since October 2009 after 40 per cent of students opted out, citing the Data Protection Act. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/10/4BE6135F00000578-0-image-m-12_1525857486582.jpg","title":"MPs tear ministers dropping plans amnesty troops Northern Ireland","story":"    Theresa May (pictured in PMQs today)  admitted that it is \u0027patently unfair\u0027 British former troops have been hounded through the courts while terrorists have escaped justiceSpeaking in the Commons in PMQs, Mrs May said British armed forces \u0027put their lives on the line day in day out\u0027 and the peace in Northern Ireland today is largely down to them.She added: \u0027We have an unfair situation at the moment....the only people being investigated for these issues are those in our armed forces or those who served in law enforcement in Northern Ireland.\u0027That is patently unfair - terrorists are not being being investigated - terrorists should be investigated and that is what the government wants to see.\u0027 The furious row has erupted over the future of legacy prosecutions for unsolved cases and claims of abuse dating back to The Troubles.Chaos surrounds Corbyn as aide says he has no plans to visit...May faces taunts at PMQs over Boris Johnson\u0027s \u0027crazy\u0027 jibe...Share this article    Tory MP Mark Francois warned ministers that they would face a rebellion on their hands if they pander to terrorists and ditch proposals for an amnesty for UK troops who served in Northern Ireland during the troubles  Some senior MPs had urged a statute of limitation which would prevent anyone from facing trial for offences that happened during the conflict, including former servicemen and paramilitaries.Victims\u0027 representatives, Sinn Fein, the DUP and the Irish Government voiced concerns.Mechanisms to deal with the conflict legacy were agreed in the 2014 Stormont House Agreement an amnesty was not among them.The proposals, including a new independent investigatory unit, a truth recovery body and an oral archive, had been on ice due to a small number of outstanding Stormont political disputes.The proposals are expected to be published soon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/09/11/4C021B4D00000578-0-image-a-3_1525863038907.jpg","title":"Britains heatwave comes abrupt end temperatures set plummet","story":"    A woman makes the most of the warm weather at St James\u0027s Park in London today as she relaxes on a bench  Commuters, walkers and runners make their way along the edge of the boating lake at Regent\u0027s Park today          Horses trot around in the warm weather in a field near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire today          A woman runs past the boating lake as a beautiful morning greets Londoners at Regent\u0027s Park today          A man and women enjoy a spot of lunch as sun seekers make the most of the weather at St James\u0027s Park today  Two dogs run along a footpath, while a woman does the same at Regent\u0027s Park in London on a sunny day this morning          A woman lies on the grass at St James\u0027s Park today, as temperatures remain warm before tailing off later this weekMaximum temperatures recorded over the weekend were 79.3F (26.3C) on Sunday, and 74.7F (23.7C) on Saturday.

MPs considered the Iran nuclear deal row in response to a statement from Mr Johnson todayAndrew Percy, another Tory former minister, also urged the Government to back the US after condemning Iran\u0027s \u0027increasingly malign and dangerous influence\u0027. But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry attacked the \u0027recklessness and idiocy\u0027 of Mr Trump\u0027s decision, telling the Commons that he had taken it without the \u0027slightest justification and without the simplest rational thought\u0027 about what would happen next. Conservative former minister Sir Nicholas Soames criticised Iranian interference although he labelled Mr Trump\u0027s decision \u0027very poor\u0027. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also said ministers had now discovered the \u0027limits of sycophancy\u0027 in dealing with Mr Trump as he sought assurances to protect British industry and motorists from a potential \u0027oil shock\u0027In a joint statement last night, Mrs May, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French president Emmanuel Macron voiced regret at the US move.\u0027Together, we emphasise our continuing commitment to the JCPoA.

It\u0027s just not quite sunk in.\u0027She said she was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her son\u0027s achievements, which include campaigning for deaf friendly cinema screenings, at such a young age.\u0027He is raising awareness of the difficulties and struggles that deaf children face, and he\u0027s doing it very well,\u0027 she said. The charitable entrepreneur          \u0027Miss Macaroon\u0027 Rosie Ginday, 34, (right) earned her invitation after Harry and Meghan were blown away by her Birmingham social enterprise and baking business on a visit to the city earlier this year.Set up in 2011, her sweet treats organisation reinvests profits into developing disadvantaged young people\u0027s potential, training them as chefs, and offering them real world experience.And the royal couple got the chance to sample some of her trainees\u0027 macaroons during their visit in March.The qualified pastry chef and former English teacher said: \u0027Harry and Meghan came to Millennium Point (Birmingham), and got to taste our macaroons which was really fun.\u0027They were both so passionate about meeting all the young girls there and took a real interest.\u0027They\u0027re accessible as well, and it\u0027s great to have a younger generation of royals showing they do care and they are invested in what young people can do.\u0027Ms Ginday\u0027s organisation has worked with care-leavers, the homeless, lone single parents and those with mental health problems, introducing them to working life, at the firm\u0027s shop and bakery, and even giving some the chance to work at Michelin star restaurant Purnell\u0027s.The inspiring primary school teacher          David Gregory (right) will be will be celebrating his first wedding anniversary on the same weekend as the royal wedding.Fortunately, though, the 28-year-old from Blyth, Northumberland, is taking wife Hannah to enjoy the festivities in the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19.The pair married on May 20 last year and Mr Gregory described the invitation as the \u0027perfect\u0027 way to mark their own milestone.Mr Gregory, who teaches Year 4 at Newsham Primary School in Blyth, said : \u0027My mam wanted to go, the headteacher wanted to go, but the only thing that was ever going to happen was for me and my wife to head down.\u0027He will be wearing his own wedding suit for the occasion, but joked that his 26-year-old wife is stopping short of turning up in her wedding gown.\u0027We\u0027d always planned on celebrating our one-year anniversary as you\u0027d expect, but I don\u0027t think it could have been any more perfect,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m planning on going in very formal attire. I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy - it all feels like a bit of a whirlwind.\u0027 The amputee campaigner          Ex-Royal Irish Regiment soldier Phillip Gillespie (right) says it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford.The 30-year-old, who lost his right leg in Afghanistan in 2011, is also eagerly awaiting news as to whether he has made the rowing and archery teams for the next Invictus Games - a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

They want to be more visible and accessible, but on their terms, not ours.The Princes have spoken far more frankly about their struggles with depression following the death of their mother than anyone in their position has done before.          What wedding present will the Queen (pictured at the Royal Windsor Horse Show today) gift her beloved grandson Harry when he marries Meghan in a few days\u0027 time?Inspired by their mother, Harry and William have reached out to the homeless, the underprivileged and the disabled, in all sorts of commendable ways.They have used their high profiles to draw attention to what they see as social injustice. All this is be applauded, especially as they were reared in such a rarefied environment. Not for them state education, housework, or Saturday jobs for pocket money, starting work at the bottom of the career ladder.JANET STREET-PORTER: What poor Alfie Evans needs now is...Why SHOULD Charles automatically replace his mother as head...JANET STREET-PORTER: The tacky shrine to villain Henry...JANET STREET-PORTER: Have I got news for you, ladies - if...Share this articleHarry - once the party animal regularly photographed partying in Las Vegas and falling out of nightclubs - has railed against the restrictions imposed on him by his father and Palace advisors - and both brothers distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother’s tragic death.By comparison, Meghan has taken some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting career - and is said to have a huge influence on Harry. He’s better dressed, has started meditating, drinking healthy smoothies, and shunning junk food.          Harry and William both distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother Diana’s tragic death. The trio are pictured together in London in 1995Her background, with orced parents and some embarrassing relatives, gives her a far wider experience of the world than her husband. Harry spent ten years in the army, a highly regimented existence, miles away from the UK. He has never had a regular job, but promotes his charities like the Invictus Games and has just been given the courtesy job of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his grandmother.Over the years, Meghan will have gone to humiliating casting sessions, she will have been rejected many times, and will have developed a thick skin and ruthless ambition to land a job in a long-running soap.If she accepts the title of Duchess now, she will be letting working women down in a big way, women who have also struggled to rise up through the corporate and business world, to get recognition for their achievements through pay or powerful jobs.A few of these women get awarded honorary degrees and titles, if they are lucky enough to be spotted - I have a CBE (given to me by the Queen) and an MA in the Creative Arts - and I am not embarrassed about that, I worked my a*** off in the media and broadcasting for over 40 years and helped dozens of other women along the way.          Meghan Markle took some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting careerOn the other hand, the Royal women get titles for doing absolutely nothing - Catherine (or Kate) took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note, working for a fashion retailer.Her real job is prolonging the royal lineage, having given birth to two Princes and a Princess in relatively quick succession. Harry has now slipped down the succession to number six - making it highly unlikely that Meghan will ever become a Princess.In the eyes of the British aristocracy, though, Meghan will never be ‘posh’, she is an outsider and will remain so - but that’s no bad thing.When Camilla married Prince Charles, she became the Duchess of Cornwall, and could have accepted the title of Princess. Out of deference to the memory of Diana, she declined. When Charles becomes King, Camilla’s official title will be Princess Consort.          Kate took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note. The couple are pictured with their newborn son Louis on April 23All these titles are no guarantee that the recipient will be accepted by the narrow minded blue bloods of the English aristocracy and the landed gentry. The example of Sarah Ferguson should act as a warning to Meghan. Sarah became the Duchess of York on her marriage to Andrew, a title which she has held onto since their orce (which seems ridiculous).

It\u0027s just not quite sunk in.\u0027She said she was \u0027very proud\u0027 of her son\u0027s achievements, which include campaigning for deaf friendly cinema screenings, at such a young age.\u0027He is raising awareness of the difficulties and struggles that deaf children face, and he\u0027s doing it very well,\u0027 she said. The charitable entrepreneur          \u0027Miss Macaroon\u0027 Rosie Ginday, 34, (right) earned her invitation after Harry and Meghan were blown away by her Birmingham social enterprise and baking business on a visit to the city earlier this year.Set up in 2011, her sweet treats organisation reinvests profits into developing disadvantaged young people\u0027s potential, training them as chefs, and offering them real world experience.And the royal couple got the chance to sample some of her trainees\u0027 macaroons during their visit in March.The qualified pastry chef and former English teacher said: \u0027Harry and Meghan came to Millennium Point (Birmingham), and got to taste our macaroons which was really fun.\u0027They were both so passionate about meeting all the young girls there and took a real interest.\u0027They\u0027re accessible as well, and it\u0027s great to have a younger generation of royals showing they do care and they are invested in what young people can do.\u0027Ms Ginday\u0027s organisation has worked with care-leavers, the homeless, lone single parents and those with mental health problems, introducing them to working life, at the firm\u0027s shop and bakery, and even giving some the chance to work at Michelin star restaurant Purnell\u0027s.The inspiring primary school teacher          David Gregory (right) will be will be celebrating his first wedding anniversary on the same weekend as the royal wedding.Fortunately, though, the 28-year-old from Blyth, Northumberland, is taking wife Hannah to enjoy the festivities in the grounds of Windsor Castle on May 19.The pair married on May 20 last year and Mr Gregory described the invitation as the \u0027perfect\u0027 way to mark their own milestone.Mr Gregory, who teaches Year 4 at Newsham Primary School in Blyth, said : \u0027My mam wanted to go, the headteacher wanted to go, but the only thing that was ever going to happen was for me and my wife to head down.\u0027He will be wearing his own wedding suit for the occasion, but joked that his 26-year-old wife is stopping short of turning up in her wedding gown.\u0027We\u0027d always planned on celebrating our one-year anniversary as you\u0027d expect, but I don\u0027t think it could have been any more perfect,\u0027 he said.\u0027I\u0027m planning on going in very formal attire. I felt very comfortable and happy in my wedding suit so I think that\u0027s the right way to go.\u0027Obviously we thought about Hannah wearing her wedding dress as well but we\u0027re not going to try and steal any limelight.\u0027Mr Gregory, who was put forward for an invitation by the Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland, was singled out for his work strengthening and celebrating his local community in Blyth.His recycling initiative with pupils won a Love Northumberland award, and he is a driving force behind the Port of Blyth\u0027s STEM hub, designed to encourage pupils\u0027 engagement with STEM subjects, and inspire their future careers.The youngsters in his school have yet to find out about his invite because they are on holiday.\u0027I can\u0027t wait to tell them. We\u0027re looking at how we can make this really relevant and real to the children,\u0027 Mr Gregory said.He is, however, planning to record a video diary of his experience on the day for them.   The Welsh charity worker          Zoe Ardunell (above) will be lucky enough to see the couple for a second time, having met them during a recent visit to Cardiff Castle.The 20-year-old from Penygraig in Wales described that as \u0027a very happy day\u0027 and said Harry told her she was \u0027definitely a role model\u0027 for her work with the Valley Kids charity which helps disadvantaged children and families.She will take as her guest her 62-year-old grandmother Pat Churches, who she said \u0027loves the royals\u0027.Ms Arundell said she was relieved to see she had no plans that weekend, but quickly added: \u0027I think if I did have any plans they would be changed straight away!\u0027 Schoolgirl born with one leg          A schoolgirl born with one leg who became a charity ambassador and mental health champion is now looking forward to buying a new dress.Jorja Furze, 12, (right) says she will go shopping with her mother, Gabrielle, 39, who will also accompany her on the day, for something to wear for the event.Describing her delight at receiving an email invitation last week, the schoolgirl said: \u0027I was really excited and shocked because I didn\u0027t think I would get an invite.\u0027I had been told my name had been mentioned to some people about the wedding, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get close to it.\u0027The youngster, who was born with only a right leg, is an ambassador for the Steel Bones charity which supports civilian amputees, added: \u0027They thought I would be a good candidate.\u0027I\u0027ve grown up without a leg and they thought having someone that younger children could relate to would be good.\u0027Jorja, from the village of Isleham near Ely, Cambridgeshire, has also set up a quiet space at her high school where children with mental health issues can relax.She said: \u0027Me and my friend both suffer from anxiety and mental health, we decided we should do something because we knew a lot of people had similar problems and we convinced the teacher to let us start this up.\u0027 The community lunchers          Tessa Hince (right), who lives near Banbury, Oxfordshire, and Hayley Ash, of Shipston-on-Stour, both 32, have been running the successful Shipston Christmas Community Lunch, since 2016.The community event brings together people who might otherwise be isolated at Christmas, drawing its funds and produce from public donations.Both had already got invitations to the Queen\u0027s garden party on May 15, and joked they now needed to find different outfits for the wedding.Miss Hince, who is taking along her best friend, said she was \u0027absolutely speechless\u0027 and \u0027so excited\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s giving some coverage to this great cause,\u0027 she added.Miss Ash, who is taking her mother as a guest, said: \u0027It\u0027s crazy - it all feels like a bit of a whirlwind.\u0027 The amputee campaigner          Ex-Royal Irish Regiment soldier Phillip Gillespie (right) says it is \u0027a wee bit surreal\u0027 to think he will be there next month with his girlfriend, Kirsty Crawford.The 30-year-old, who lost his right leg in Afghanistan in 2011, is also eagerly awaiting news as to whether he has made the rowing and archery teams for the next Invictus Games - a brainchild of Harry.Mr Gillespie, who is involved with ABF The Soldiers\u0027 Charity, said he was looking forward to a busy few months with the Invictus trial results, the wedding and then a royal garden party following his BEM award last year.He said he had not told many people yet but expected his friends\u0027 reaction to be muted, compared to the feedback his girlfriend was getting.\u0027I think Kirsty has got more of a reaction, I think it (a wedding) is more of a girl thing,\u0027 he laughed.He added: \u0027It\u0027s a massive privilege, it will be a huge spectacle.\u0027                                                      Revealed: The full schedule and timings of Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding from their arrival at Windsor Castle to a glitzy evening bashRoyal fans across the country have been waiting with bated breath for the full details of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding day.And finally Kensington Palace have released the full schedule and timings for the big day.Here we look at what we can expect on May 19, from when the first guests arrive at Windsor Castle to the evening celebrations at Frogmore House.The couple will spend, as according to tradition, the night before their wedding apart.There will be no American-style maid of honour and all of the couple\u0027s page boys and bridesmaids – who are expected to include Prince George and Princess Charlotte – will be children.The couple will not go on honeymoon straight away – and will, remarkably, undertake their first public engagement as man and wife just days after the ceremony.

They want to be more visible and accessible, but on their terms, not ours.The Princes have spoken far more frankly about their struggles with depression following the death of their mother than anyone in their position has done before.          What wedding present will the Queen (pictured at the Royal Windsor Horse Show today) gift her beloved grandson Harry when he marries Meghan in a few days\u0027 time?Inspired by their mother, Harry and William have reached out to the homeless, the underprivileged and the disabled, in all sorts of commendable ways.They have used their high profiles to draw attention to what they see as social injustice. All this is be applauded, especially as they were reared in such a rarefied environment. Not for them state education, housework, or Saturday jobs for pocket money, starting work at the bottom of the career ladder.JANET STREET-PORTER: What poor Alfie Evans needs now is...Why SHOULD Charles automatically replace his mother as head...JANET STREET-PORTER: The tacky shrine to villain Henry...JANET STREET-PORTER: Have I got news for you, ladies - if...Share this articleHarry - once the party animal regularly photographed partying in Las Vegas and falling out of nightclubs - has railed against the restrictions imposed on him by his father and Palace advisors - and both brothers distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother’s tragic death.By comparison, Meghan has taken some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting career - and is said to have a huge influence on Harry. He’s better dressed, has started meditating, drinking healthy smoothies, and shunning junk food.          Harry and William both distrust the press, who they see as being partly responsible for their mother Diana’s tragic death. The trio are pictured together in London in 1995Her background, with orced parents and some embarrassing relatives, gives her a far wider experience of the world than her husband. Harry spent ten years in the army, a highly regimented existence, miles away from the UK. He has never had a regular job, but promotes his charities like the Invictus Games and has just been given the courtesy job of Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his grandmother.Over the years, Meghan will have gone to humiliating casting sessions, she will have been rejected many times, and will have developed a thick skin and ruthless ambition to land a job in a long-running soap.If she accepts the title of Duchess now, she will be letting working women down in a big way, women who have also struggled to rise up through the corporate and business world, to get recognition for their achievements through pay or powerful jobs.A few of these women get awarded honorary degrees and titles, if they are lucky enough to be spotted - I have a CBE (given to me by the Queen) and an MA in the Creative Arts - and I am not embarrassed about that, I worked my a*** off in the media and broadcasting for over 40 years and helped dozens of other women along the way.          Meghan Markle took some dreary jobs as she struggled to kick start her acting careerOn the other hand, the Royal women get titles for doing absolutely nothing - Catherine (or Kate) took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note, working for a fashion retailer.Her real job is prolonging the royal lineage, having given birth to two Princes and a Princess in relatively quick succession. Harry has now slipped down the succession to number six - making it highly unlikely that Meghan will ever become a Princess.In the eyes of the British aristocracy, though, Meghan will never be ‘posh’, she is an outsider and will remain so - but that’s no bad thing.When Camilla married Prince Charles, she became the Duchess of Cornwall, and could have accepted the title of Princess. Out of deference to the memory of Diana, she declined. When Charles becomes King, Camilla’s official title will be Princess Consort.          Kate took the title Duchess of Cambridge when she married Prince William, before which she did few jobs of any note. The couple are pictured with their newborn son Louis on April 23All these titles are no guarantee that the recipient will be accepted by the narrow minded blue bloods of the English aristocracy and the landed gentry. The example of Sarah Ferguson should act as a warning to Meghan. Sarah became the Duchess of York on her marriage to Andrew, a title which she has held onto since their orce (which seems ridiculous). Andrew remains next in line to the throne after Harry and then their daughters, the party Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice - both of whom are said to get on well with Meghan.Sarah’s antics have caused maximim embarrasment to the Royals, along with her endless quest for an income - she’s appeared on TV reality shows and even endorsed weight loss programmes. Sarah has been invited to the wedding ceremony, but is said to be furious she has been denied an invitation to the party in the evening for just 250 guests. Being a Duchess cuts no ice in that company.If Harry and Meghan want to show they’re in touch with their subjects, they should decline this chance to pick up an unearned title and stick to Mr and Mrs Wales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bde64eb4f732c26f0f5c17a364ef36a20551427b/1_0_4410_2647/master/4410.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31b8df1a03f0865026a2d2a78b0f695b","title":"azzedine alaia exhibition towers but has lightness of touch design museum","story":"Co-curated by the late designer, Design Museum show avoids the pomp of a retrospectiveHe was 5 ft 3 (1.6 metres), but the mannequins wearing his dresses at the Design Museum in London are 6 ft 11 without high heels. Visitors to Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier, which opens on Thursday, are met by a phalanx of seven such Amazons, each dressed in the late designer’s signature leopard print and black.The exaggerated height of the mannequins amplifies what Alaïa’s clothes have always done, which is to make women look extraordinary. “No other dress can make a woman look and feel as good as an Alaïa dress because it cinches the body perfectly,” as Naomi Campbell put it. Dominated by 60 outfits hung unfettered on these towering transparent bodies, this exhibition is a simple appreciation of the technical brilliance of a designer’s hands-on artistry. But the clothes have a sensual power that lifts the show above dry academic examination. Invited to admire the engineering of a floor-length black gown with thick gold zips snaking around its hourglass curves, the visitor’s mind is drawn to the effect such a dress would have when it walked into a room.The exhibition, co-curated by the designer before his sudden death last year, brings to life the fashion world’s best-kept secret. Because it was not intended to be viewed posthumously, the show has a lightness of touch, without the pomp of a retrospective. Alaïa was a cult figure in the fashion industry but, obsessed with the very highest quality of fit and production, he never sold dresses widely or inexpensively enough to become a household name. The outpouring of emotion on his death, and the recent opening of a London store, has given his name a higher profile than it ever had when he was alive, so this show is perfectly timed to fill in the backstory.The dresses are gathered by aesthetic theme, rather than chronology. There is a clique of tiny dresses in supple stretch leather, a forbidding trio of dramatic hooded draped gowns including the look worn by Grace Jones in A View To A Kill, and a dancefloor’s worth of grand gowns with the volume Alaïa spun from air in honeycomb knits and miniature plissé pleats that his many imitators could never quite recreate. The space is ided by metalwork screens, commissioned by Alaïa from designer friends including Marc Newson and Kris Ruhs, which bring to the exhibition space a hint of the 19th-century ironwork which frames the courtyard of Alaïa’s Paris home and headquarters in the Marais, venue for fashion week catwalk shows and impromptu dinners.Richard Wentworth’s intimate portraits of life in this Rue de la Verrerie space, blown up on the back wall, show a life of chic simplicity and laser-focussed craftsmanship. A dinner table is laid for a generous number of friends and family, but with simple settings of white napkins and tumblers, no flowers or placecards Alaïa is bent over the setting of a sleeve, a mille-feuille of tape measures and tracing paper and fabric piled all around. A timeline on the opposite wall includes images of his most beloved clients, including Tina Turner and Jessye Norman as well as Jones and Campbell – a reminder that the Tunisian-born designer championed ersity decades before the rest of the fashion industry.A reportage film made by Ellen von Unwerth during the preparation, staging and aftermath of an Alaïa show in 1990 is a joyful time capsule of pre-Instagram joie de vivre, featuring a baby-faced Campbell sashaying on the catwalk, Helena Christensen reading a book with her hair in rollers, and a cigarette-smoking Christy Turlington drinking beer standing on a zinc-topped Paris bar.Alice Black, the director of the Design Museum highlights a dress of black broderie anglaise, every millimetre overstitched with shimmering black beads, as her personal standout garment in the show. One of the earliest pieces, from 1981, is singled out by Carla Sozzani, a close collaborator of Alaïa, as her “absolute favourite”. Spliced from black leather and sharply pleated fabric, with bodycon curves set against sharp geometric lines, it is “just perfection”, she said at the launch. “I could look at this dress forever.”Azzedine Alaïa: The Couturier at the Design Museum, London, 10 May to 7 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51c71eadd12d60a2966ec117d7ce0adafc25eaac/0_0_4384_2629/master/4384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68bdbede4631f31e769c91f01a044422","title":"brither in ice alicia kopf review","story":"Catalan artist Alicia Kopf’s Brother in Ice came about unusually for a work of fiction: it was generated via a series of art exhibitions called Àrticantàrtic, an “exploration of exploration” in which Kopf pursued the pursuers of the white places on the Earth, people who journeyed to the extremes of north and south just to see what was there.The novel – if that’s what we can call it – integrates these preoccupations, but contextualises them within the life of a young woman living in Barcelona, whose older brother, M, is autistic, though the doctors cannot identify where on the spectrum to place him. The human body itself is an unknowable landscape within which doctors can only diagnose through approximation and calculation. We meet M in interludes between research notes, illustrations (taken from Kopf’s gallery shows), mini-essays on explorers’ journeys, and the narrator’s diary entries. Kopf describes M as a\u0026nbsp“man trapped in ice”: alive beneath it, looking out at the world, he is both “there” and “not there”.This finds an unexpected echo in the author’s preoccupation with polar explorers, people such as Louise Boyd, who had already led seven expeditions by the time she became the first woman to fly over the Earth’s rotational axis in 1955, aged 68. On a journey to the Arctic through Norway, she said of the ice she could glimpse in the distance: “I want to be there, looking out, instead of here, looking in.”Kopf frequently juxtaposes science with the metaphysical, or with quotidian banality. Set against the growing body of “facts” and “documents” that preoccupy the narrator, the status of the personal material is less certain is it fiction or non-fiction, and does it matter? How much can we ever trust what we are told in a novel is the writer looking in or out? The narrator herself is obliquely acknowledged to be a fictional invention, both there and not there: at one point she identifies herself as Alicia Kopf, who is, of course, the author of the book we’re reading, but Alicia Kopf is actually the pseudonym of a woman called Imma Ávalos Marquès, whose name is on the copyright page. “I’m not an author,” Kopf writes, “just an explorer of my limited textual possibilities.” A writer, she shows us, is a kind of polar explorer: both are driven by an obsession with abstraction both are “seeking out something in an unstable space”.About a third of the way into the novel, Kopf quotes a speech made by the Catalan oceanographer Pepita Castellví, which itself concludes with a quote from Ernest Shackleton: “The Polar regions leave a profound mark on those who have struggled in them, which is difficult to express to men who have never left the civilised world.” This seems like an apt summary of what it means to be an artist or a writer. Brother in Ice is finally about the tension between having a creative life that allows us to escape our everyday lives and responsibilities to our loved ones. The places we start from – our selves, homes, loved ones – are as unknowable and unlocatable as the poles themselves. The dialectic between home and away collapses in the polar whiteness of the creative process, which Kopf describes as a “territory” that is “not yet visible to me”: “If it were, I wouldn’t write.” If it were easy to get to, everyone would go. But then, Kopf notes, “It’s much easier to get to the Arctic than to reach certain areas of one’s self.”.Lauren Elkin’s Flâneuse is published by Vintage. • Brother in Ice is published by \u0026ampother Stories.

In the book, Wilkie Collins keeps Marian Halcombe at the home, moving in with her sister Laura and brother-in-law Walter to become a surrogate parent to their children (and, according to some literary critics, throwing a semi-incestuous sapphic ner in to the works). The BBC adaptation instead whisked Marian away to go travelling around the world – possible, although not easy for a single woman in the 19th century.But that wasn’t the first break with the source material that the BBC’s take gave us. Because while Jessie Buckley is spirited and delightful in the role, she’s far too pretty to be Marian . One of the greatest heroines of Victorian literature, Marian is introduced in Collin’s novel through Walter Hartright’s rather voyeuristic eyes. Walter drools over his future sister-in-law from afar, particularly her figure – “visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays” – at least until he gets close enough to see her face: “Never was the old conventional maxim, that Nature cannot err, more flatly contradicted – never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the head that crowned it. The lady’s complexion was almost swarthy, and the dark down on her lip was almost a moustache.” As Cher Horowitz from Clueless might put it, she’s a total Monet (great from a distance, but a mess up close).Buckley is the latest in a long line of striking women actors trying to “plain up” – Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot (“her bloom had vanished early and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her”), Talulah Riley as Mary Bennet (“the only plain one in the family”), Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre (“Don’t address me as if I were a beauty, I am your plain Quakerish Governess”) – and just the latest attractive woman to play Marian: there was Diana Quick in the 1982 TV adaptation, Tara Fitzgerald in the 1997 film, then Maria Friedman in the oddly compelling musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 2004.But what is “ugly” in literature can only go as far as “unconventionally beautiful” on telly, it seems. The latest Woman in White is yet another example of sexed up adaptations even the creepy Count Fosco, described in the novel as approaching 60 and “corpulent”, is played by Riccardo Scamarcio, who is visibly neither. With Fosco, Collins was manipulating a prevailing Victorian idea that all fat people were jolly and inoffensive, unsettling readers by introducing a villain in the guise of comic relief. On a practical level, these changes make sense: Marian is such a scene-stealer that Walter needs a reason to prefer with Laura over her, while the complicated nature of Marian and Fosco’s interactions boils over into sexual tension, as opposed to stomach-churning sleaze.But perhaps there is another reason why we’re meant to find Marian unattractive, why the reader is supposed to take Walter’s preference for blonde-haired Laura for granted. Marian is “swarthy”, Walter says, and Laura describes her sister’s “dear Gypsy face”. That, plus the “thick, coal-black hair, growing unusually low down on her forehead”, seems a a clear indication Collins didn’t envisage his heroine as being white. Although much has been written about Heathcliff’s skin tone in Wuthering Heights, Marian’s race seems to have flown under the radar. It’s a minor point of scholarly debate, but when it comes to an adaptation it becomes flagrant whitewashing – a lead role in a primetime period drama going to an actress of colour could be a career game-changer, not to mention reminding viewers that the Victorian period was nowhere near as white as we’ve been led to believe.The latest Woman in White played fast and loose with its source material, but if the producers had wanted to break with convention, there was a far more faithful – and radical – way they could have done it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbef697e34dedc54462e330acf86d5a59184a703/0_173_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f08e6df0c704d747db83e5816e76c69","title":"poutine and beyond 10 local eats you have to try when youre in canada","story":" The revered combo of chips, gravy and cheese curd is arguably Canada’s national food – even McDonald’s serves it. But there are dozens of other regional delicacies to be found across the country. From sweet treats to edible ferns, here are 10 to get your teeth stuck intoFrom Vancouver’s deserved reputation for incredible Asian fare to the hearty variation on French peasant food found in Quebec, Canada’s cuisine reflects its enviable confluence of cultures. Diversity here is not just an abstract concept – it is something you can taste, from unlikely imported favourites like Ukrainian pierogi dumplings and Jewish deli-style smoked-meat sandwiches to home-grown poutine.Nanaimo barsThese decadent sweet treats consist of a chocolate crumb base covered in custard-flavoured butter icing and topped with a layer of chocolate. Different places do different versions, and often deviate from the original recipe (known as the classic), with everything from nuts to coconut to peanut butter thrown in. You’ll see Nanaimo bars in bakeries across Canada but, as the name suggests, they originated in Nanaimo, a small city on Vancouver Island. Visit there and you’ll find multitudinous interpretations of this much-loved treat. There’s even a 39-stop Nanaimo bar trail where you can sample Nanaimo bar martinis, cupcakes, waffles and spring rolls, and get a themed pedicure at a local spa. Halifax donairWhen you see your first Halifax donair you may wonder why this is considered special – after all, it looks like the same late-night doner kebab that is served in cities the world over – but there’s a delicious twist that makes it unique. A Halifax donair comes served with a sweet garlic sauce that resembles runny icing, and is unbelievably delicious. The sauce is made up of evaporated milk, garlic powder, vinegar, and sugar, and is what gives these kebabs their cult following. In recent years they’ve gone a bit gourmet, and you’ll find them served in other major Canadian cities – but always listed as a Halifax donair. You should absolutely try one, even if sober.FiddleheadsEvery spring you’ll see fiddleheads on the menus of high-end restaurants and at farmers’ markets across Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Fiddleheads, the curly, edible shoots of the ostrich fern, are usually foraged along marshy riverbanks and woodlands. Like so many regional delicacies, they are an acquired taste, but their flavour varies greatly depending on how they are prepared.BeavertailsThese massive flat doughnuts originated in Ottawa back in 1978, and are found sold at Beavertails stands and stores across Canada. Served regular, Beavertails come sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar, but there’s a whole range of toppings from chocolate banana or apple cinnamon to hazelnut, maple and more. All are, of course, delicious, and are especially tasty when eaten on a cold day with a cup of hot chocolate. PoutineThis combination of fries and cheese curd smothered in gravy is a Québec classic that you’ll find served throughout the country – it’s even on the menu at McDonald’s outlets across Canada. So it won’t be hard for you to try some version of this very Canadian street food. And once you’ve navigated the classic, explore the variations: many restaurants in Nova Scotia serve lobster poutine (which is amazing), and there are plenty of places in Québec – such as La Banquise in Montreal – that have entire poutine menus, where the toppings include everything from roast chicken, peas and stuffing to smoked beef brisket.Cod tongueAs unappetising as they sound, cod tongues – served pan-fried with scrunchions (bite-sized fresh pork scratchings) – are delicious and tender. Like lobster, cod tongues used to be considered a poor man’s food, but now you’ll find them on menus at fancy restaurants up and down Canada’s east coast, often listed as a starter.Butter tartThe ridiculously rich butter tart is a Canadian staple. The consistency and taste is somewhat similar to a treacle tart, but not quite, and the topic of whether or not butter tarts should contain raisins is rather controversial. You’ll find butter tarts everywhere, from the fanciest bakeries to gas stations in middle of nowhere, but if you want to experience the best of the best, head to Ontario’s Best Butter Tart Festival, held every June in Midland, Ontario.PierogiThere’s a huge Ukranian population in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, so it’s no surprise that pierogis are a big thing there. These tasty little dumplings traditionally come stuffed with meat or cheese and potato, but now you’ll find them stuffed with everything from blueberries to caramelised onions, because pierogi have gone upmarket. You’ll find pierogi food trucks and high-end restaurants doing them in interesting ways across Canada. If you’d prefer to go old school, look for homely pierogi joints when visiting Winnipeg or Saskatoon (which even has a pierogi drive-through, Baba’s).BannockThis flash-fried bread resembles a doughnut, and has long been a staple in the diet of some of Canada’s indiginous communities, who produced their own variation by baking a wild plant called camas, before European settlers introduced wheat flour in the 17th century. You’ll see it served at traditional restaurants – or if you visit a reservation while in Canada – but also on the menus of fine-dining restaurants (sometimes served as a starter or in place of bread, and often with a ramekin some delicious thing to slather it with). Extremely moreish.Montreal smoked-meat sandwichesThe meat in one of these epic sandwiches is brined, spiced and smoked brisket. This comes piled high in sliced rye bread and spread with mustard, and is a carnivore’s dream. Schwartz’s Deli in Montreal is one of the best places to find an authentic sandwich (which comes with fries and a pickle) and the real Jewish deli experience – it has been using the same recipe since 1928 and the interior doesn’t look like it’s changed much in decades. If the queues at Schwartz’s look daunting, then cross the street and join the locals at the Main Deli Steak House. It’s where Montreal-born Leonard Cohen would get his fix whenever he returned home.For more information and inspiration, see explore-canada"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc7a510541da2bc1abc9b0104e882f1fa08b7730/0_0_5139_3320/master/5139.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f33c170ad9eebb73b501ac2cc6bf926e 700w","title":"running wild five of the best national park runs","story":"Boost your stamina by hitting a national park trail, where natural wonders will push you to new heightsLength: 4 milesTime: 50 minutesStartfinish: Loch Morlich Beach car park (OS Explorer OL57)Grade: EasyAscent: 164 feet (50 metres)Terrain: Wide gravel paths and forest trailsRefuel: Glenmore Visitor Centre cafe (PH22 1QU)Home to the highest mountains in the UK, the Cairngorms national park is known for its snowy plateaux and abundant Munros (hills over 3,000ft914 metres). But don’t let the extreme landscape put you off lacing up your trainers, as among the lofty peaks are swathes of ancient native forests and hidden lochs to explore on foot – and you won’t need to pack an ice-axe or crampons. This gentle route takes you on a clockwise circuit of Loch Morlich, a tranquil stretch of water surrounded by woodland and fringed by sandy beaches at the foot of the northern Cairngorms. For most of the waymarked route you’ll be running through open pine forest, glimpsing views of Loch Morlich and the stunning backdrop of rounded, often snow-covered mountains mirrored in its still water. The area is a haven for wildlife – it’s worth pausing to catch your breath at one of the many burns (streams) that feed the loch, for a chance to spot dippers, wagtails and herons. As you continue around the loch keep an eye out for red squirrels darting up trees and golden eagles soaring overhead. Once you’ve completed the four-mile loop, there’s always the option to finish with a bracing dip in the water at Loch Morlich beach, famous for being one of the highest in Britain.Length: 3.8 milesTime: 1 hourStartfinish: Whitesands car park (OS Explorer OL35)Grade: ModerateAscent: 392ft (119 metres)Terrain: Coastal path and heathlandRefuel: Whitesands beach cafe (SA62 6PS)Following a section of the long-distance Pembrokeshire Coast Path, this 3.8-mile circular route around St David’s Head packs plenty into its short length. And what it lacks in mileage it more than makes up for with a magnificent seascape dominated by Ramsey Island and an archipelago of rocky islands known as the Bishops and Clerks. As you follow the undulating coast path towards the rugged peninsula of St David’s Head, it’s worth looking back at the curving mile-long sandy beach of Whitesands Bay with its rolling surf breaks. Along with breathtaking coastal views and plenty of wildlife-spotting opportunities, the route passes two prehistoric monuments: Coetan Arthur, a 5,000-year-old burial chamber, and an iron age coastal fort perched at the end of the peninsula. The inland return leg takes you through wildlife-rich heathland that skirts the lower flanks of the jagged outcrop of Carn Llidi, before rejoining the coast path back to Whitesands Bay. If you’re keen to try a spot of off-road running then this is a very accessible circuit with enough punch to give your legs a bit of a test.Length: 11 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Market Cross, OsmotherleyClay Bank car park (OS Explorer OL26)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 2,460ft (750 metres)Terrain: Stone-paved moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Lordstones cafe at Carlton Bank (TS9 7JH)Following a segment of the 109-mile Cleveland Way national trail across the northern escarpment of the North York Moors national park, this is a strenuous route with some thigh-burning ascents and descents. But at the top of each steep climb you will be rewarded with outstanding views across the national park and beyond: north to the distant conurbation of Teesside and south and east across an expanse of moors and dales. The waymarked route heads north out of the pretty village of Osmotherley before entering a rollercoaster landscape that crosses five undulating moors: Scarth Wood Moor, Live Moor, Cringle Moor, Cold Moor and Hasty Bank. Along the way, signs of the area’s industrial past are visible in the remains of alum, jet and ironstone mining the raw materials that were transported to Teesside during the Industrial Revolution. After a well-deserved break at Lordstones cafe, the route gets serious as it crosses the Three Sisters, a series of steep, rocky climbs with technical downhill sections including the impressive jagged sandstone crags known as the Wainstones, before a final steep descent brings you to Clay Bank. It’s not a route for the faint-hearted, but it certainly delivers when it comes to stunning moorland scenery. And the sense of achievement you feel at the end is most definitely worth it.Length: 7.3 milesTime: 2 hoursStartfinish: Heddon valley National Trust car park (OS Explorer OL9)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,270ft (387 metres)Terrain: Woodland track, exposed coast path and quiet roadRefuel: Hunters Inn, Heddon valley (EX31 4PY)The deep, wooded Heddon valley on the western flanks of Exmoor national park is a hidden gem for trail running, with its appealing mix of terrain, from gentle riverside paths and peaceful woodland tracks to rugged high sea cliffs and exposed moorland. And this circular route includes a healthy blend of them all. It begins in a tranquil woodland setting following an old smugglers’ path towards Heddon’s Mouth Cleave. But don’t be lulled into a false sense of “easiness” – the sting isn’t in the tail of this route, but a mere mile into the run when it climbs a steep zig-zag path to reach high sea cliffs with spectacular views across the Bristol channel to the south Wales coastline. You will need to keep your wits about you at this point as the route follows a narrow, exposed path that runs perilously close to the edge of the sheer cliffs rising more than 650ft (200 metres) above the sea below. It’s worth pausing along this coastal stretch to take in the rugged coastline, both ahead and behind you – if you’re lucky you may spot a kestrel hovering above the path or a peregrine falcon nesting in the cliff face. Veering off the coast path the route takes you across open moorland to reach its highest point at Holdstone Hill (1,145ft349 metres) before gently descending into dense oak woodland to follow Ladies’ Mile back to Hunters Inn, where you can reward yourself with a pint of local ale.Length: 10 milesTime: 3 hoursStartfinish: Cutthroat Bridge lay-by on the A57 (OS Explorer OL1)Grade: ChallengingAscent: 1,689ft (515 metres)Terrain: Moorland paths and woodland tracksRefuel: Ladybower Inn (S33 0AX)The Peak District national park can certainly deliver the goods when it comes to a bracing off-road course with stupendous views. On this 10-mile circular route, prepare yourself for some hefty climbing during the first half as you ascend to Derwent Moor and journey along the ridge of Derwent Edge, but once past the trig point at Back Tor (1,765ft538 metres) the remainder of the route is much less demanding. Your first glimpse of Ladybower reservoir, a vast Y-shaped man-made reservoir, appears as you approach Whinstone Lee Tor, and as you continue northwards along Derwent Edge, passing a number of surreal eroded granite outcrops, the views of the Peak District landscape continue to impress: east across a vast stretch of exposed moorland and west along the lush Derwent valley towards the distinctive ridge of Mam Tor, Hollins Cross and Lose Hill in the distance. The final segment is a gentle leg-stretcher along the eastern edge of the reservoir through Ladybower wood, passing through the lost village of Ashopton, which was flooded during the construction of the reservoir in 1940s. This isn’t a route for putting your head down and gunning for a personal best in fact, it’s worth easing off your pace so that you can fully enjoy the spectacular scenery.Unisex Colorado running packThis pack is ideal for long trail runs, with adjustable hip belt and chest straps.

But from Rihanna’s pope to Lena Waithe’s rainbow-flag cape, the opening night ball was a triumphIt took curator Andrew Bolton several years to convince the Vatican to give its blessing to Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, the blockbuster show at the politan Museum in New York that explores ine inspiration in fashion. One imagines Rome’s reluctance stemmed from concern that the exhibition – and particularly the opening night gala, which has become known for its outrageous outfits – would trivialise religious imagery.It needn’t have worried. Fashion takes clothes very, very seriously. In a world in which dressing up matters and sartorial symbolism carries a very real weight, the Met Gala is the most important night of the year. Even when it looks absurd to outsiders – remember the omelette dress of 2015? – the fashion seen on the Met Gala red carpet has been considered and planned with the solemnity of a papal conclave. In their Manhattan hotel rooms, celebrities dress for this event with a level of meticulous ceremony which would befit a Sunday at St Peters.This year’s dress code was a challenge. To succeed on this red carpet required honouring the theme of Catholicism in fashion without being seen to make fun of it. What is special about the Met red carpet – by comparison, for instance, with Cannes – is that you can’t win it just by looking good. A supermodel can wear a tight dress and high heels and sail through almost every other public occasion with flying colours, but that look is a fast track to being completely ignored at the Met. You have to dig deep for this night, because Met Gala triumph requires not just beauty but bravery and a leap of faith. The Vatican would surely approve.The obvious link between the world presided over by Pope Francis and the one ruled by Queen Anna Wintour is that clothing delineates status. Rihanna attacked this theme with her signature fearlessness and blew everyone else out of the water. In the season of the first Millicent Fawcett statue and of a Christian Dior slogan T-shirt namechecking Linda Nochlin’s feminist essay “Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists”, RiRi gave us a female pope. She wore a heavily embellished mini dress under a matching cloak, accessorised with a pointed mitre, stiletto heels and pearls strung around one ankle – because, after all, there’s not always room for a rosary in a clutch bag – all created for her by John Galliano for the house of Maison Margiela. The look was a version of an ensemble designed by Galliano during his time at Christian Dior that appeared on the catwalk in 2000 worn by a man, and is included in the Met exhibition.But clothes are never only about power, either in fashion or in the church. Beauty as a metaphor for human goodness runs through the history of art, through religious iconography and through the way fashion worships at the altar of beauty and glamour. Katy Perry was a triumph in Versace. In a gold dress and boots, and with a 6ft white feathered wing, she was arguably the most breathtaking representation of the archangel Gabriel since Fra Angelico painted the Annunciation fresco in the Convent of San Marco. (And yes, I do realise how sacrilegious that is, in artistic terms.)Sienna Miller in gold and white Louis Vuitton was also ine as another Renaissance angel on the red carpet.The transactional business of fashion is a multimillion-pound industry precisely because it taps into powerful emotions and desires. Fashion deliberately blurs the boundaries between things that you have the power to change and the things you don’t. (You can buy the perfect party dress, but you can’t actually buy romance or joy or fun.) Religious imagery has long employed the same porous boundaries, conjuring the invisible into life. The word halo – an accessory seen last night on Solange Knowles in Iris Van Herpen and Lily Collins in Givenchy, among others – means glory. And the aesthetic of papal garments has roots in worldly power, as well as spiritual. When the Emperor Constantine moved his capital east to Constantinople and allowed the pontiffs to assume control the old capital, Rome, they incorporated some of the clothing and accessories worn by the Roman emperors who had ruled before them, the better to legitimise their power in the eyes of the people of Rome.Like all the best dress codes, the Met Gala invitation allowed for lots of iniduality. Frances McDormand consolidated her role as 2018’s designated maverick by coming as “a pagan”, she said on the red carpet, in her butterfly headdress by Philip Treacy for Valentino. Those actors who have pledged vows to fashion houses (or at least, signed contracts with them) showed their constancy with looks that mined clerical robes for the most this-season silhouette. A clear winner on this is the mozzetta, a short shoulder-covering robe worn by the pope and cardinals and, last night, by a very chic Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton. Kate Moss wore a black dress with a feathered black neckline that nodded to the dress code with a fallen-angel vibe – this was her first appearance in the US since 2009, and there was speculation that the prolonged absence was due to difficulty procuring a visa after the drug scandal of 2005 – but mainly referenced herself. Moss in a black feather trim dress, with Johnny Depp at Cannes, and a messy bun, is a late-1990s fashion reference the fashion faithful will immediately recognise.Best red-carpet quote of the night, though, goes to the actor Lena Waithe, who wore a rainbow flag cape to spotlight the Catholic church’s complicated relationship with the LGBTQ community. “The theme to me is, like, be yourself,” she told the New York Times on the red carpet. “You were made in God’s image, right?”• This article was amended on 9 May 2018 to clarify a credit.

What message am I supposed to draw from it?Daisy, by emailGlad you asked, Daisy, because there are many lessons to take from I Feel Pretty, but not one of them is the message that the movie itself is promoting. Let’s look at this film, briefly. Schumer plays a woman, Renee, who feels ugly and is treated like an absolute troll by everyone around her, because that is how Hollywood thinks people who look like Schumer should be treated. She then whacks her head on a giant piece of Convenient Plot Device and is so brain-damaged that when she wakes up she thinks she looks beautiful because, Christ, you’d basically have to knock out all your grey matter to think Schumer, an A-list actress, is attractive, right? The film proceeds to laugh at her for the next two or whatever hours as she goes around town acting deranged because she thinks she’s gorgeous, which is definitely how grown women behave. She also ditches her friends because she feels too beautiful for them, which is also how women behave, and all of this is a searing exploration of the beauty standards for women or something something blah blah blah feminist lite word salad feminist lite word salad. Anyway, the film ends with Renee realising she’s not pretty, but is, like, on the inside, and she then makes a super-inspirational speech about the importance of inner beauty while selling makeup to other women the film considers equally trollish. Because inner beauty is great but, let’s be honest, gals, it has its limits.Schumer has spent much of the past few months insisting this film is all about helping women’s self-esteem, which suggests she hasn’t actually seen it. Because what it is actually saying is that women who don’t look like Emily Ratajkowski, who also appears in the film, are public laughing stocks who, at best, might learn to style it out. Well, I\u0026nbspcan’t really blame Schumer for giving it a miss because it’s absolute garbage and I’d rather eat my hands than have to sit through it again.What I am interested in is not what beauty does or doesn’t do to women, but what Hollywood has done to Schumer. There is a\u0026nbspfascinating disjunct between the stuff Schumer made for TV and the stuff she is making for the movies. Her sketch show, Inside Amy Schumer, was uneven, like all sketch shows, but when it was good it was excellent, skewering standards for female beauty and the expectations society puts on women and women put on themselves. Yet her films, namely Trainwreck and I Feel Pretty, do precisely the opposite. In Trainwreck, which Schumer wrote, her character had to prove she was worth some tedious sports doctor, and to do this she had to quit her job, become a cheerleader and be physically humiliated. I Feel Pretty is one long sneer at Schumer and anyone who doesn’t look like Ratajkowski, a\u0026nbspwoman whose real-life career, as far as I can tell, is Instagramming her cleavage. Now, we can argue all day about whether photographing your boobs is a feminist pursuit or not (spoiler: it’s not), but any film that posits someone who does this as the physical ideal is not a film that can seriously claim it is fighting against the narrowness of beauty standards for women.Schumer is not the first woman whose brilliance on TV has been bleached out of her in the movies – Tina Fey has been here before her, as was Gilda Radner before that. But there is something extra dismaying about seeing Schumer make – and defend! – this egregious woman-hating garbage, when she used to be smarter than this. So the conclusion to draw, Daisy, is that Hollywood is the Sunken Place for smart women, where their souls and brains are cut out of them as they find themselves serving, zombie-like, the oppressors they once abhorred. It’s too late to save Schumer, but can we all just promise not to let Mindy Kaling, Jessica Williams and Kristen Schaal go the same way, too? Because, honestly, I don’t think my heart could take it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64166e43220e39ddb229ae49adfaf8aff2b6c303/66_270_2338_1403/master/2338.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=510864e595ea55fb65d1c3c7d4887bfa","title":"liverpool diogo leite porto","story":"Liverpool are leading the race to sign Porto’s Diogo Leite this summer.Porto are determined not to lose the 19-year-old centre-back, who is also a target for Arsenal and Manchester City, but Liverpool have been impressed with the youngster’s performances for the Portuguese side’s B\u0026nbspteam this season and have made their interest in him clear.Reports in Portugal have suggested that Arsenal are prepared to meet Leite’s €15m release clause this summer, but Anfield is his likeliest destination at the moment.Liverpool are building a strong reputation for developing young talent under Jürgen Klopp and that could help them steal a march on Arsenal and City.

Conversation reveals Arsenal will never leave Philippe Senderos. “I am a fan now, I want them to do well,” explains the Swiss centre-back.From a rich and varied career, which continues apace with the MLS side Houston Dynamo, Senderos is most closely associated with north London. His arrival at Arsenal before the start of the iconic 2003-04 season was, when still a teenager, the realisation of a lifelong ambition. “Since I was five, six years old there was something appealing about the Premier League. Something about England, the wet pitches, I don’t know … I loved it. It was what I wanted to do. I realised a dream when I came to Arsenal.”There should be no shame attached to the fact that Senderos, initially beset by injury, did not make an impact in a team who won the Premier League without defeat. He revelled in a box seat as history unfolded. “I was part of the team, in the dressing room, training with them,” he recalls. “I couldn’t get in the team, which is understandable for an 18-year-old at an unbeaten side.“It was amazing to witness – the champions that we had in that team were remarkable. It was my first glimpse of the top level and I could see it was special. At any moment, at any time, people were winners. You could feel there was something going on. It isn’t normal to win all the time even if two goals down, there was a strength and belief in what they were doing.“I am forever grateful to Arsène Wenger and to Arsenal. They gave me the opportunity to fulfil a dream, which was to play in the Premier League. They are still very close to my heart and I have very good memories regardless of things that can be said, I have amazing memories. It was a great time.”From thousands of miles away Senderos has been aware of fierce criticism levelled at Wenger. He recalls what made the soon-to-depart manager one of a kind. “Transmitting this belief. You have a philosophy, every manager has one, but how do you transmit it so that the team plays the way you want? If everyone buys into this, it becomes special. Everyone believes. He has been able to do that for more than 20 years, so I can only have respect for him. Also, the level of stress he is under constantly to be at the top level for so many years, the stress attached to performance and the next game, every single day, is remarkable.”Senderos believes Wenger had a useful capacity to shoulder criticism. “A personality like him wouldn’t mind if he takes the blame and protects his team,” he says. “They aren’t getting results like they used to. People like to blame someone in football. We are results-driven, so this is unfortunately what happens.“ Teams go through ups and downs. I just think the league has got a lot stronger – the investment in the Premier League is huge.”At 33 and a veteran of three World Cups, Senderos insists he has never called time on his international career despite the last of his 57 caps having come in 2016. “They did that for me,” he says with a broad smile, before adding: “The door is always open. I always find it sad when people retire. I loved my time playing for my country. You never know: my dream is to play in a fourth World Cup.”Senderos had spells at Fulham, Aston Villa and Rangers but his current concern is Houston Dynamo, where his influence on younger players is praised within the club. An articulate and thoughtful inidual who speaks six languages, he has relished the mentoring role. “I have been lucky to have had good years in the Premier League,” he says. “I needed another challenge, something new, and this was a very good opportunity.“We have a lot of young players. That makes it interesting for those of us who have been in the game a lot longer. We can teach these guys. You see the improvement around the team, which has been huge since pre-season. Most of the training sessions and meetings are half in English, half in Spanish. I think that was one of the points that made the club think of me.”It was consideration for others which struck Senderos last year after Hurricane Harvey hit Houston, destroying many homes. “I arrived a week before the hurricane,” Senderos says. “I was stuck for a while in my hotel room but thankfully the area where I was wasn’t that badly affected. It wasn’t possible to get to the training centre, so we didn’t train for a couple of weeks. Then we moved out to Dallas to train.“But unfortunately so many other people were affected by the hurricane. I really experienced how the community came together and helped the people who had more problems. For me there was an unbelievable reaction and I’d never seen a reaction like this from a community.“I remember going to the stadium and it was full of food, blankets, anything for people who had lost things in their home. People came together, we had a very successful season last season and maybe this was a reason why. We did things for the city, for the people the baseball team had an amazing last year as well. Sometimes things going against you brings people together.”The strongest Senderos alliance may be with Arsenal, but he clearly relishes his present one too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d8a3db25b5f56e3cd95d954f8458b92c104507/0_238_5605_3363/master/5605.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bc308cf453af998c15ed319407c382c","title":"young ethiopians poverty yemen the gulf","story":"Persecution and hardship in the Oromia region drives tens of thousands of migrants each year to cross the Red Sea from Djibouti, in a bid to reach the Gulf“We met in the desert,” says Badru Mohammed, gesturing at his three companions. The four Ethiopian boys pause for breath and refreshment beside the road, grasping their plastic water bottles tightly as they sip, careful not to waste a drop. The Djiboutian sun is still low in the sky but the road is already hot. They have more than 200km left to walk and their plastic sandals are disintegrating.Badru and friends are from Jimma, a poor farming district in Ethiopia’s Oromia region. Over the past fortnight they have travelled more than 1,000km from their homes, first on buses and then later on foot, jumping the border into neighbouring Djibouti under the cover of darkness. When the group gathered in Dire Dawa, a town in the arid drylands of eastern Ethiopia a couple of hundred kilometres from the border, there were 20 of them. “Most are left in the desert,” says Badru wearily. “They are very tired. I don’t think they can follow us.”Many do not make it. The numbers that die in the Djiboutian desert are unknown but there are enough unburied dead to contaminate the water supply. Ethiopians walking along the road north to Obock told the  that friends had perished en route. Another group of three, also from Jimma, say they had no food for the duration of the six-day walk from Dire Dawa. Seven of their companions were left in the desert some got lost, they say, but one they watched die. “We’ve had no help from anyone,” says the youngest, a 10-year-old orphan.The journey across the Bab el-Mandeb strait to Yemen is also perilous. One recent estimate put the numbers who have died making the crossing over the past decade at close to 3,000. The boats organised by smugglers are old, rickety and often overcrowded. Few Ethiopians can swim but the vessels, which depart at night in order to avoid detection, usually hover 20m or so away from the shore, which can be fatal for those clambering aboard.The anarchy in Yemen brings a welter of dangers. In January at least 30 people drowned when their migrant boat capsized, with reports of gunfire being used against those on board. In March 2017, a helicopter opened fire on a vessel carrying more than 140 migrants, killing 42 Somalis. Those who make it to shore then face multiple threats. UNHCR has catalogued reports of physical and sexual abuse, abduction, extortion, torture and forced labour by smugglers and criminal networks. “Only a very small minority make it to Saudi Arabia without facing at least one incident of abuse,” says Danielle Botti of the regional mixed migration secretariat (RMMS), which monitors movements between the Horn of Africa and Yemen.Those who survive remain vulnerable. Some are deported straight back to Yemen rather than home, in violation of international law. Some have their passports taken away by their employers, which is against international labour conventions. Francesco Martialis, head of Caritas, which works with street children in Djibouti, recounts the story of a 15-year-old who had fled life as a slave in Saudi Arabia. He had been beaten, his skull cracked, leaving him with amnesia. Unable to remember his family or his home, he had walked hundreds of kilometres alone along the road from Obock to Djibouti City, in the country’s south, before being picked up by police.Young Ethiopians in Obock are either unaware or unfazed by the dangers awaiting across the sea. Around 250 have set up makeshift homes under acacia trees and in caves beneath the cliffs near the rubbish-strewn village of Fantahero. “So what?” asks Hassen, a 20-year-old teacher from Wollo region. “That’s the life of the Ethiopian people.” His companion, Murad, 18, agrees: “We fear Ethiopia more than the war in Yemen.”Many cite persecution and violence as reasons for fleeing. Oromos, the country’s largest ethnic group, complain of marginalisation for more than three years anti-government protests and deadly confrontations with security forces have plagued the region. “I quit my schooling and came here,” says Mohammed, a 17-year-old from Arsi in southern Oromia. “I was a ninth-grade student. But when I saw youths like myself being arrested and thrown in jail I decided to leave. I was afraid of being arrested too.”But for most, poverty is the biggest grievance. “I’m going to Yemen because I need work,” says Hassen. “There’s nothing in Ethiopia. I have a job but it is too expensive there – 2,000 birr (£53) a month? That is not enough! In Saudi Arabia I will get 10,000 birr a month.”Three days earlier, police had arrived in Fantahero and loaded many of the boys into trucks to deposit at the Ethiopian border. But on the whole the migrants are tolerated. Obock locals have done well out of smuggling and a journey that costs somewhere between $300 and $500 (£221-£368) per person. “Nobody will control it,” says Momina Ahmed, a French-Djiboutian who grew up in the town. “All the locals, including the authorities, are profiting.”An IOM transit centre in Obock, across the road from a UNHCR camp for Yemeni refugees fleeing in other direction, is one of the few institutions available for people who want to return to Ethiopia. It assists with voluntary returns, but it can take in only around 250 at any one time. Mohammed, the schoolboy from Arsi, says he is one of the few in Fantahero to get cold feet, but that the centre was full when he visited earlier in the day.Elsewhere in Djibouti, facilities are even more scarce. Mobile health patrols started work only late last year. There are plans to build a humanitarian shelter at Lake Assal, near where the desert hits the coast. There is only one shelter in Djibouti City for migrant children, Caritas, and it is prohibited from providing beds at night.Few will return home without something to show for their efforts. “If it is the will of Allah to improve my life, then maybe one day I will return to Ethiopia,” Badru says fatalistically. Just as he speaks a police truck pulls round the corner. Within moments, the four boys have been ushered into the back by armed police officers, their long, hard journey cut suddenly short."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fbee5d18106b39065dfb8cbef90f441237d4980/0_602_1659_995/master/1659.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bb63b73c129f2129fcb77ca8d696f06f","title":"custardo replacement for affogato custard and espresso works","story":"Affogato means “drowned” in Italian and, by no coincidence, an affogato is an ice-cream drowned in coffee. A dessert (or drink, depending on your appetite), it usually involves one scoop of vanilla ice-cream and one shot of espresso. Technically speaking, the ice-cream is burned by the espresso, but “scotta” is a little harder to pronounce. Either way, the ice-cream dies a quick but painful death. Bitter irony, then, that the affogato is one of multiple casualties of the so-called Great Vanilla Shortage currently sweeping the nation.It’s no laughing matter – fuelled by a rise in global demand and a squeeze on Madagascan production, vanilla is no longer affordable. Pods can now cost up to £515 a kilo, making them more expensive than silver. The crisis is in its early stages – there’s still vanilla ice-cream in shops – but, by God, go now. The bigger ice-cream companies, such as Jude’s, have absorbed the cost. But many artisanal gelaterias have already scratched vanilla off their chalkboards.This is excellent news for the custardo, a confectionary confection that swaps ice-cream for custard. Custardo was supposedly created by a cafe in London’s coffee belt, Peckham, called Forza Win (where they use creme anglaise) and the result is not dissimilar to Vietnamese hot egg coffee, which mixes egg yolks with sugar, condensed milk and coffee. It is also, arguably, from the same wheelhouse as bicerin, Turin’s highly prized morning drink, which mixes espresso with chocolate and whole milk, a potent combination that stimulates bodily fear and calorific anguish among churchgoers who drink it after mass.Michele Vollaro, general manager at London’s Cafe Murano St James, has heard of it but not tried it. “In Naples, we only drink very traditional coffee,” he says. “I’m a big fan of something like an espresso martini in the evening, but for a pick-me-up in the morning it has to be straight down the line – either an espresso or a cappuccino.” Custardo is a stupid word, and may not take off in Italy, but it is pretty easy to make.Technically (again), custard is usually made with vanilla but – and here’s the key – it’s not a must. When I made custardo, there was nothing decent left in the shop, so I used cheap own-brand custard, which tasted as though it had once been in the vicinity of vanilla, but not made actual contact. Rather than drowning, the custard sort of belly flops into the coffee with a special sort of gracelessness. But I had it for breakfast, and it works. What should have been egregious as a pairing was, in fact, as rich and thick as Theresa May’s cabinet, the custard cutting through the espresso’s bitterness. I’m sure the real stuff – proper vanilla custard and coffee – is better. But if the vanilla shortage continues, we may have to opt for second best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73fa60819029d7c237cba0e0dbc0147cb0e21244/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d25cd7970df732651b63085569313f5","title":"ice cream parlours booming instagram teetotalism","story":"Offering everything from liquid nitrogen-frozen creations to vegan sundaes, a new breed of dessert bars are changing the way people socialise – and dateBuilt in the Victorian era and now a sedate enclave of independent cafes and shops, Cardiff’s Castle Arcade does not look like a crucible of radical innovation. Enter Science Cream, however, and you step into a world of Heston Blumenthal-style theatre. Stood behind a Perspex screen, dressed in white lab coats and protective goggles, this ice-cream parlour’s “laboratrists” use great billowing flasks of liquid nitrogen to instantly freeze what is – thanks to LN2 creating such tiny ice-crystals – some of the smoothest, most thickly luxurious ice-cream you will ever taste.It is a spectacle at which, not just children, but even the most cynical adults cannot help but marvel. “Today, it’s all about doing what Amazon can’t and giving customers an experience,” says the owner, Carly Karran, who is hunting for a second site in Bristol. “We’re already nostalgic about ice-cream, it brings people joy, but throw in the liquid nitrogen vapour and it’s a double-whammy, a very Instagrammable one. It ticks all the boxes.”With its freshly blowtorched marshmallows, homemade honeycomb and use of all-natural ingredients (to ensure clear, intense flavours), Science Cream is a high-end parlour. Two scoops of its sea salt and burned caramel or black charcoal coconut ice-cream will cost you up to £5. But this hip store is also an example of a wider surge in the popularity of ice-cream parlours and dessert bars. A surge that, powered by fast-expanding national chains such as Kaspa’s and Creams, is bucking high street trends.If you are over 25, you may well never have heard of Creams, but this urban dessert bar chain (which serves hot pudding and waffles too, making it a go-to even in winter), has opened 70 sites in the past seven years and is aiming for 300 by 2022. A franchise operation, it is big enough that, until recently, it had former Nando’s regional director Handley Amos as its CEO, yet is relatively circumspect in its marketing. Aside from select associations with, for instance, Thorpe Park amusement park, it has grown (140,000 Facebook and 15,000 Instagram followers), largely via social media chatter.Last year, Creams made a subtle cameo (it’s “where you see a lot of dates take place,” explained Vice music site, Noisey), in the video for Big Shaq’s viral grime spoof, Man’s Not Hot. Evidence, says Creams co-founder Adam Mani, of its “cult following” among young people, particularly in London.From mainstream Creams to Ginger’s Comfort Emporium, a “grown-up” parlour in Manchester’s alternative Affleck’s Palace, social media is now a key driver in people’s ice-cream habits. Forget three-course meals, people want experiential moments in food. They want to eat colourful, out-there dishes that look great shared online. Ice-cream parlours, says PwC consumer expert Lisa Hooker, are perfect for “experience-seeking millennials” who crave innovative, affordable treats: “They have lots of products. It’s fun. There’s a lot going on.”“We’re plugged into that,” says Ginger’s owner, Claire Kelsey, whose £3.30-a-scoop flavours run from her legendary Chorlton Crack (salted caramel and peanut butter), to apple, mint and wheatgrass. Kelsey also makes several vegan ice-creams using oat milk and coconut oil. “We get loads of people coming in showing us their phones and saying, ‘Can I have that?’ We put weird flavours on our ice-cream van, and that’s what people want after seeing it on Twitter. There’s a lot of adventurous palates.”At the level of Science Cream and Ginger, margins are tight. They are producing small volumes and using expensive ingredients that need labour-intensive preparation and cooking. But mainstream dessert bars can be very lean, nimble businesses. At Creams, all its gelato (a lower-fat Italian version of ice-cream, made with more milk and less cream) is manufactured at a central production facility. Its cakes are bought-in. No chefs are needed. There’s no big kitchen investment. Throw in its counter-ordering and the fast turnover of customers and, even though the average spend at Creams is only £8 (two scoops of ice-cream for £3.95 most of its sundaes are £6–£8), it is a potentially lucrative business.“These dessert bar formats are absolutely outpacing the growth of normal restaurants,” says Joe Lutrario, deputy editor at Restaurant magazine. “Waffles, coffee, cake, ice-cream, it’s all serious money-making stuff and you only need a few staff to serve it. It’s a different, more profitable model and you can have an experience there for six quid, which is dramatically cheaper than somewhere like Nando’s.”Sat in Creams’ Stockport branch – a contemporary diner decorated with street art-bedecked skateboards, music pumping away in the background – it is easy to understand its appeal. It feels just cool enough to impress pickier teens without alienating anyone, including their parents. The unusually cheery staff make it welcoming, and my five-year-old is entranced by the gelato display.That product itself is Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s quality (a compliment!), and if a sample crepe feels a little sad and flabby, a cookie-dough crush sundae, topped with Mr Whippy-style ice-cream, caramel sauce and cookie dough crumb, is wolfed down. The kid’s blue bubblegum ice-cream is vile, obviously, but it does mimic that “screwball” flavour with eerie accuracy. None of this is cheap. Three of us are in and out in half-an-hour, £20 lighter. But the young couples in the neighbouring booths are in no hurry. You could stretch a tenner out here over an hour or so, which people seem to be doing more and more. For the ice-cream parlour’s rise is not solely a story about changing trends in ice-cream consumption (we are eating less ice-cream, but opting for better-quality options when we do indulge), but also a cultural shift in how we socialise.Founded in 2004 in Walthamstow, east London, Afters Original was one of the capital’s first dessert bar chains. It now has 10 sites. It opened, in no small part, to give young Muslims and families somewhere to hang out, locally. Its venues (garishly pink, US-inspired diners decorated with giant jukeboxes and even the occasional Chevrolet) are all alcohol-free, as is Creams, and open until late (1am in some cases), serving a global menu ranging from Mississippi mud pie to malai kulfi. “The Muslim community or people who don’t drink had limited places to go socially, and it can get boring going to the cinema every week,” says the owner, Kais Niaz. “This was kind of a replacement. Also, a lot of the old, traditional east London ice-cream parlours had closed. We created this buzz about dessert.”That buzz has now gained a national traction. Creams’ Adam Mani argues that a broad swathe of millennials, many non-drinkers or infrequent drinkers, are looking beyond the pub or coffee shop (“that’s an older generation”) for places to meet: “Youngsters don’t necessarily want to be in environments with alcohol, and families feel safer sending their kids to a place where they can have an ice-cream. We try to accommodate every ethnicity, dietary restriction and taste. I think that’s worked well in the sense that people’s social and cultural sensitivities are unconsciously accommodated.”Anecdotally, women are using dessert bars a lot, too both dry ones and those that serve booze. “It’s very female-led,” says Anthony Quinn, owner of Nottingham’s The Pudding Pantry. “Often, you look around and there’s not a single male. It’s an alternative to a bar. Come here and have a prosecco and some puddings.”All this sounds like a future-proofed demographic – young, multi-ethnic, female – that big corporations such as Unilever, owner of Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Carte D’or, must be desperate to connect with. But Unilever shows little sign of entering this high-street parlour game. Its Ben \u0026amp Jerry “scoop shops” are almost entirely in cinemas. Such “dinosaurs” are poor, argues Mani, at adapting to youth trends: “London is a phenomenal melting pot of ideas and cultures and a lot of bureaucratic institutions don’t tap into that knowledge.”Could concerns about obesity and the growth of healthier diets be an existential threat to this boom? “I don’t feel threatened,” says Kelsey. “There’s so much noise around those issues, but most sensible people know you can’t live on ice-cream.”Niaz, whose Afters venues literally have their cake and eat it by also serving sorbets and healthier smoothies with names such as “flu-fighter”, sounds equally unconcerned: “It’s been designed as a treat, not an everyday meal. It’s not cheap-cheap. It’s a luxury.”In a global context, it is a luxury that still offers plenty to explore. A new development in London’s Chinatown, Central Cross, is home to several east-Asian dessert bar brands, such Guo C 100 and Roro, that serve durian milk puddings and Cantonese mango pancakes rarely seen in the UK. Someone from Creams, which already sells Hong Kong-style “bubble-pop” waffle cones, is probably there, right now, eating hard in the name of research. The future? It looks very sweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf46f4f4310ad2771fd5e41f58d5b4fac40da6d4/0_477_2385_1431/master/2385.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a76b1eccc18a98e43d38582886031e05","title":"six of the best party snacks","story":"Elevate the nibbles for your next do by whipping up salt cod fritters, pork hand pies or shrimp and caper bunsFor the pastry175g butter, diced200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting2 tsp grated parmesan1 egg yolk15ml ice-cold water1 tsp saltFor the fillingJuice of 1 lemon100ml olive oilSalt and black pepper1 fennel bulb, finely diced 20g dill (or fennel top), chopped300g white crab meat150g brown crab meat10g parsley, chopped 1 pinch cayenne pepperHeat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6.

But what do you think? Send us your thoughts and responsesOccasionally Travellers settle on a small common near where I live. There is a playground on the common, but the caravans that were previously here weren’t near it, and didn’t take up much space. I have never noticed any problems when Travellers settle here, but the rest of my community are vehemently against it. They insist that stealing and litter-dropping rise when Travellers arrive. They have signed petitions and asked the council to prevent them from settling. This anti-Traveller sentiment seems to unite all parts of the community. Recently I noticed that large rocks and raised plant beds had been placed around the common, which someone informed me was a council initiative to stop Travellers driving on to the land. How do I know if this is true? Why is it that being anti-Traveller is still acceptable and why is the council supporting the community in this regard? Surely, the Travellers are legally allowed to settle on this land as it is held in common.Additionally, Nuttall says, it’s common for local authorities to limit opportunities for Travellers to stop over, even when it is their right to do so: “Local authorities spend hundreds of thousands every year creating ditches and earth mounds, and putting up metal barriers and gates, that prevent Travellers from settling when it may actually be cheaper to house them.” Such restrictions not only stop the council earning money through rents and council tax from the Traveller community, they also create health, education and housing inequalities.So there could be a battle ahead. I have looked into the detail of the common that you mention. It came under local authority ownership a long time ago, meaning your local council is responsible for it. You should scour your council website to see whether any development plans for the common have been included in recent planning or policy papers, giving the reason why. It’s unlikely you will find an outright mention of wanting to disturb a specific community, but you can check whether the council has considered the needs of Travellers through an equality and impact assessment, and write in to raise your concerns if not. But be wary of trying to be a saviour: your intentions may be good, but without consultation with the Traveller community, you could end up accidentally causing more harm.

Chuka Umunna, the Labour MP who co-chairs a pro-European Commons committee with Conservative Anna Soubry, said the leadership would now have to come off the fence and make it clear where it stood. “The time for constructive ambiguity is over: our members and our voters will be delighted with this clear signal that we will not go along with this Tory Brexit,” he said.The vote came hours after Boris Johnson called the prime minister’s proposal for a customs partnership “crazy” in an interview with the Daily Mail that dealt a major blow to the government’s strategy of a cautious balance between leave and remain. Johnson was the subject of fierce criticism from within Tory ranks all day. In the Lords debate the former Tory MP Patrick Cormack asked: “What sort of example are we being given by a cabinet that is rent asunder by the foreign secretary, the second most important cabinet minister, rubbishing the prime minister in the columns of the Daily Mail?”On the key EEA amendment, Labour peers were whipped to abstain. But 83 defied the whip to back the amendment, including a former party leader, many former ministers and a former chief whip. Seventeen Conservatives also backed the amendment.It was the third defeat of the afternoon for the government and an unexpected triumph for a cross-party group that included Waheed Alli for Labour, the Conservative peer Sandip Verma and the crossbench peer Karan Bilimoria.All the amendments to the bill that have been passed in the Lords will have to be considered and voted on by MPs when the bill returns to the Commons, perhaps as soon as next week. Lord Alli told the House that continued membership of the EEA was vital to ensure the future profitability of the UK’s export business and the jobs and livelihoods of many thousands of people. “It is the EEA that deals with services, services like retail, tourism, transport, communications, financial services and aerospace where we have a £14bn trade surplus,” he said.“The customs union only will benefit our European neighbours in their imports and without an EEA equivalent it will damage our profitable export business.” The European Economic Area currently consists of the 28 member states of the European Union as well as three members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The fourth EFTA member, Switzerland, prefers to manage its trade agreements with the EU bilaterally.The EEA agreement came into force in 1994. Aimed at allowing everyone to trade more or less as if they are in the same country, it effectively allows Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to be part of the EU’s single market in return for accepting the principles of free movement of people, goods, services and capital.The EFTA is an intergovernmental free-trade organisation created in 1960. It first negotiated trade agreements with what was then the EEC in 1972. The EFTA countries (which originally included the UK) are not in the EU customs union and can negotiate trade deals with third countries.\u0026nbspBeing in the EEA via the EFTA replicates EU membership as far as the benefits of the single market are concerned, but without the political obligations. It also comes at a cost: non-EU EEA members must conform fully with EU law in every area covered by the EEA treaty, which is almost everything except farming and fisheries.\u0026nbspEEA governance for EFTA members is assured by a joint EU-EFTA committee that decides what new EU laws fall under the EEA agreement a surveillance body that ensures compliance by all concerned and an EFTA court to rule on disputes. The EEA’s EFTA members also make financial contributions to the EU.In a rowdy and sometimes ill-tempered debate peers, many of whom had been debating the EU for the past 30 years, argued passionately for and against EEA membership.Officially Labour opposed the Alli amendment because other amendments gave MPs a role in the negotiations. But the leadership will now have to face the tension between its strongly pro-remain rank and file membership, its largely pro-remain MPs and the policy consequences of remaining in any arrangement with Europe such as the EEA, which limits its plans for greater state involvement in the economy.The Tories are now likely to try to brand Labour as the party of free movement, which is one of the obligations of EEA membership. The threat of higher EU migration is likely to alarm Labour voters in some parts of the country. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesperson said: “The referendum was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money. Ongoing participation in the EEA would mean having to implement new EU legislation automatically and in its entirety without having a say on how it is formulated – and it would also mean continued free movement. We will now consider the implications of this decision.”Peter Mandelson, the former trade secretary and one-time EU trade commissioner, said ministers were perpetrating a “Brexit fraud’ by pretending that migration from the EU, which would continue under membership of the EEA, would end after the UK left.“The time has come for economic reality and commonsense to prevail over wishful thinking and political dogma,” he said. “This gives us the opportunity to do the right thing for the country and in my view that is what we have a duty to do.”The EEA offers most of the benefits of the single market, without being subject to the European court of justice. It does not cover the common agriculture or fisheries policies. Earlier, peers voted to remove the EU exit date of 29 March 2019 from the withdrawal bill, warning that it would be a straitjacket for negotiators. The Duke of Wellington, Charles Wellesley, who moved the amendment, insisted he was not trying to undermine the result of the referendum by delaying or averting Brexit.“We should give ministers a bit more flexibility to secure and obtain ratification of the best possible deal, which will do the least damage to the economy and the national interest,” he said.The government also lost another vote on an amendment seeking to protect UK membership of EU agencies such as Euratom. The Labour leader in the Lords, Angela Smith, said it was an opportunity for the Commons to think again.“The House of Lords amendment is not about stopping Brexit but the fine print of when and how the agreements are concluded,” she said.The defeats came on the final day of debate on the report stage of the bill in the Lords. Peers are due to send it back to the Commons at the end of the week, and the government hopes it will be on the statute book before the end of May. The government has been forced to make concessions, as well as losing a dozen votes during the debates, in a series of amendments that have often had cross-party support.The amendments have been ided between trying to preserve benefits of EU membership, such as workers rights, and other fundamental rights through the incorporation of the EU’s charter of fundamental rights, which has a broader reach than the UK Human Rights Act.Others were intended to promote the place of parliament at the heart of the process of leaving the EU, including clarifying the significance and consequences of the “meaningful vote” on any Brexit deal. And some were more narrowly technical, intended to restrict ministerial powers to change laws without proper parliamentary process and debate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f66abf4243564ae052940fbdd206487c3e252c/71_127_3161_1897/master/3161.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ed74fb1ea2f8b68e2ce3eee72f6623","title":"arron banks company provided 12m of services to leaveeu","story":"‘Administrative services’ were provided prior to £700,000 spending cap taking effectLeave.EU received more than £12m of campaign services from a company controlled by the businessman Arron Banks, despite its referendum spending being capped at £700,000.A business associate of Banks said the services were provided prior to the referendum spending cap taking effect in April 2016, and therefore entirely legal.But the disclosure, at a time when Electoral Commission investigations into leave campaign financing are continuing, will raise serious concerns about the ease with which laws restricting campaign spending can potentially be circumvented.The Labour MP Ben Bradshaw said there were “serious questions that need answering” in response to the new admission.“I would hope and expect the National Crime Agency and Britain’s financial regulators to be taking a serious look at this rather than leaving everything to the Electoral Commission and parliamentary committees whose powers of investigation and sanction are very limited,” said Bradshaw, who has previously called for an inquiry into referendum funding.“During the year the company provided administrative services of £611,184 (2016: £12,392,258) to Leave.EU Group Limited, a company with common directors,” the accounts state. Both companies are already under investigation by the Electoral Commission over their activities surrounding the EU referendum. They are controlled by Banks. The £12m is in addition to the £9m he has already been reported to have provided to the Brexit campaign.When asked what the administrative services entailed, Liz Bilney, the chief executive of Leave.EU and a director at both companies, said they related to “campaign management services, ie everything that was spent and recharged in running and setting up the leave campaign to the month and year to May 2016.”The timeline suggests Leave.EU received the sum in a comparatively short period of time. The group was incorporated in September 2015, five months before David Cameron formally announced the referendum. The regulated period, in which Leave.EU’s spending cap of £700,000 took effect, began on 15 April 2016.“It includes costs prior to the regulated period, which were assessed as to whether any element should be included in the regulated period,” she said.It remains unclear what the £12m of campaign management services entailed, and when Better for the Country began providing them. Bilney refused to elaborate on what the “campaign management services” were, and insisted the phrase was self-explanatory. “Every single invoice was analysed to ensure that it did not correspond or have any overlap into the regulated period,” she said. “So if the Electoral Commission have any issue with that, they will be looking at it, and we don’t need you to be looking at it.”When asked how a company of 33 employees had generated £12m of expenses, Banks said: “The campaign sent 11m letters, millions of leaflets, Facebook advertising, rallies around the country, and so on.”The Electoral Commission declined to comment and directed the  to its two continuing investigations.Darren Hughes, the chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said it would be for the commission to determine the facts of any inidual case, but called for the government to update electoral finance laws.“Spending limits are there for a reason: to prevent campaigns being held to ransom by big donors, and to prevent an arms race between opposing factions,” he said. “Politics must not be won on the basis of who can spend the most but on a level playing field of clear, reasoned arguments.“Whatever the facts of this case, it is time for a review of election spending rules – they must be made crystal clear.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba55381a9adef8dfb531ba85be4da5519c459078/170_0_1707_1024/master/1707.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa00393aa217f8c686b947f6a78574dc","title":"corbyn 20 comes out swinging and floors may with plain english","story":"At PMQ’s, the Labour leader has a revolutionary plan: ask the questions the country wants answered At some point in the last week the Labour leader has undergone a major reboot. At recent prime minister’s questions Jeremy Corbyn’s main achievement has been to make Theresa May appear less hopeless than she really is by failing to speak in joined-up sentences or asking questions even he couldn’t understand. All the prime minister had to do to survive unscathed was stand up and answer the question she would like to have been asked. Something that even she could just about manage.Corbyn 2.0 had a revolutionary plan. Talk in plain English. Keep things short and sweet. Stick to one subject. Don’t attempt the impossible of thinking on his feet. And ask the questions that everyone in the country wanted answered. He began by highlighting the government’s isions on Brexit. Did she agree with her foreign secretary that her favoured “customs partnership” arrangement was crazy?The prime minister couldn’t cope. May has been through several iterations of her own – no one is entirely sure if we are currently at Maybot 5.0 or Maybot 6.0 – but she has yet to find a system that is passably functional. Rather it seems that each upgrade only serves to further weaken her. Even though Boris Johnson’s contributions to cabinet collective responsibility had been front page news for a couple of days, she was totally taken aback by the question.“We are leaving the European Union and we are leaving the customs union,” she said, playing for time as so often before by offering nothing that advanced the public understanding of anything. It’s becoming clearer by the day why the government has made so little progress in its Brexit negotiations. It’s not just that no one can agree on what it is they want, but that every new development seems to take the cabinet completely by surprise. Michel Barnier must have more enlightening conversations with his grandchildren.Corbyn relaxed into his script. No deviation, no repetition, no hesitation. The Labour backbenchers couldn’t believe what they were hearing. The best response they can normally muster for their leader is a passive-aggressive silence, but now some were actively encouraging him. Their man was successfully embarrassing the prime minister by simply stating the obvious. The government was committed to working on two solutions to the customs union that both the government and EU agreed were unworkable and unacceptable. You’d be pushed to come up with a better definition of clueless.“We are leaving the customs union,” the Maybot said again as her computer crashed and she burned. By the time the exchanges between the two leaders came to an end, she was just a mess of wires and smoking silicon chips with a disembodied voice, both shrill and brittle, begging someone to unplug her. On days like this, it is hard to see how she can remain in the job. Or how she could even want to. It feels as if it’s only the pressure coming at her from all sides that is stopping her falling apart.With John Bercow away at Michael Martin’s funeral, it was deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle who was left to preside over the proceedings. Taking his cue from Corbyn’s one-line questions, Hoyle moved things along at a nice clip, putting a stop to the braying with a simple hand gesture and keeping the odd outburst of Tory sycophancy to a minimum. PMQs was all wrapped up in under 40 minutes and the MPs roared their approval. Then, they would have done so if he’d let it run for over an hour. Not being John Bercow is more than enough to raise the roof in some quarters.Boris Johnson had managed to prove his loyalty to May by refraining from heckling her – being so jet-lagged he could hardly keep his eyes open must have helped – but once she had left the chamber it was his turn at the dispatch box to explain how his one-man mission to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel peace prize had ended with the US president canning the Iran nuclear deal. It wasn’t his finest hour, but even he seemed surprised that so many of his own MPs, including former defence secretary Michael Fallon, were so quick to hail Trump’s genius. With just a hint of Boris being in charge, the lunatics really are taking over the asylum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d83b0a406abd8e68bc768f2da89c5d1c448a1d/189_21_1350_810/master/1350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de3ec1962119ffe7713618e9d0ea668c","title":"theresa may became almost incoherent at times jeremy corbyn pmqs","story":"Reader reaction to some of the most talked about stories today, including your thoughts on Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn at PMQsPrime minister’s questions dominated reader discussion on site on Wednesday lunchtime.

Here are some of your thoughts:Much stronger performance from Corbyn today, thank goodness. He nailed May on isions in the government and she became almost incoherent at times. Enjoyed looking at the glum faces, particularly David Lidington and Philip Hammond when she was trying to answer on her preferred customs arrangement.DaivedoverGiven the few times May actually answers the questions at PMQs, is it worth ditching this last charade of democracy? Maybe we should just go straight to the flimsy dictatorship already largely in place through emergency legislation, inadequate debating time, and the insertion of last minute amendments so beloved of this bunch.olderiamthelessiknowCorbyn asks the right questions, but with May this is no more effective than putting a letter in a bottle and consigning it to the waves. Her sole tactic at PMQs is ersion by way of talking-points and rehearsed soundbites.MrdaydreamForeign affairs commentator Simon Tisdall writes that “Donald Trump’s torpedoing of the Iran nuclear deal on highly specious and misleading grounds is an act of wanton diplomatic vandalism fraught with dangers.” You’ve been sharing your thoughts beneath his piece.That said, I don’t agree that the UK should withdraw its invitation. I also don’t agree with the ongoing drive to isolate the United States. For the UK to withdraw the invitation would only further add to the growing US isolationism, at a time in the world’s history when nations should be working more closely together.His decision also, may it be said, could very well add to any scepticism already extant about any possibility of securing a lasting nuclear deal with North Korea.ID6732157Readers welcomed back George Monbiot after a period away from his column.I don’t always agree with you, George but thank you for writing this.

She was wandering around the ward a few days post-op when the docs were doing their ward round. She was called back to bed, and after the usual check, and chat to the medical students, she was asked if she had any questions. She said, in her prim and proper voice “When will I be able to start having intercourse again?”. I never did find out if she meant it or it was her wicked sense of humour, but the look on the doctors’ faces and the consultant delivering advice with a bright red face was a sight to behold.dunnock49Comments have been edited for length.

He says he’s never sold marijuana this cheap before.“We have standard grams on the shelf at $4,” Alport says. “Before, we didn’t see a gram below $8.”The scene at Bridge City Collective is playing out across the city and state. Three years into Oregon’s era of recreational cannabis, the state is inundated with legal weed.It turns out Oregonians are good at growing cannabis – too good.In February, state officials announced that 1.1m pounds of cannabis flower were logged in the state’s database.If a million pounds sounds like a lot of pot, that’s because it is: last year, Oregonians smoked, vaped or otherwise consumed just under 340,000lb of legal bud.That means Oregon farmers have grown three times what their clientele can smoke in a year.Yet state documents show the number of Oregon weed farmers is poised to double this summer – without much regard to whether there’s demand to fill.The result? Prices are dropping to unprecedented lows in auction houses and on dispensary counters across the state.Wholesale sun-grown weed fell from $1,500 a pound last summer to as low as $700 by mid-October. On store shelves, that means the price of sun-grown flower has been sliced in half to those four-buck grams.For Oregon customers, this is a bonanza. A gram of the beloved Girl Scout Cookies strain now sells for little more than two boxes of actual Girl Scout cookies.But it has left growers and sellers with a high-cost product that’s a financial loser. And a new feeling has descended on the once-confident Oregon cannabis industry: panic.“The business has been up and down and up and down,” says Don Morse, who closed his Human Collective II dispensary in south-west Portland four months ago. “But in a lot of ways it has just been down and down for dispensaries.”This month, WW spoke to two dozen people across Oregon’s cannabis industry. They describe a bleak scene: small businesses laying off employees and shrinking operations. Farms shuttering. People losing their life’s savings are unable to declare bankruptcy because marijuana is still a federally scheduled narcotic.To be sure, every new market creates winners and losers. But the glut of legal weed places Oregon’s young industry in a precarious position, and could swiftly reshape it.Oregon’s wineries, breweries and distilleries have experienced some of the same kind of shakeout over time. But the timetable is faster with pot: for many businesses, it’s boom to bust within months.Mom-and-pop farms are accepting lowball offers to sell to out-of-state investors, and what was once a erse – and local – market is increasingly owned by a few big players. And frantic growers face an even greater temptation to illegally leak excess grass across state lines – and into the crosshairs of US attorney general Jeff Sessions’ justice department.“If somebody has got thousands of pounds that they can’t sell, they are desperate,” says Myron Chadowitz, who owns the Eugene farm Cannassentials. “Desperate people do desperate things.”In March, Robin Cordell posted a distress signal on Instagram.“The prices are so low,” she wrote, “and without hustling all day, hoping to find the odd shop with an empty jar, it doesn’t seem to move at any price.”Cordell has a rare level of visibility for a cannabis grower. Her Oregon City farm, Oregon Girl Gardens, received glowing profiles from Dope Magazine and Oregon Leaf. She has 12 years of experience in the medical marijuana system, a plot of family land in Clackamas county, and branding as one of the state’s leaders in organic and women-led cannabis horticulture.She fears she’ll be out of business by the end of the year.“The prices just never went back up,” she says.Cordell ran headlong into Oregon’s catastrophically bountiful cannabis crop.The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) handed out dozens of licenses to new farmers who planted their first crop last spring. Mild weather blessed the summer of 2017 and stretched generously into the fall. And growers going into their second summer season planted extra seeds to make up for flower lost to a 2016 storm, the last vestige of a brutal typhoon blown across the Pacific from Asia.“That storm naturally constrained the supply even though there were a lot of cultivators,” says Beau Whitney, senior economist for New Frontier Data, which studies the cannabis industry.It kept supply low and prices high in 2017 – even though the state was handing out licenses at an alarming rate.“It was a hot new market,” Whitney says. “There weren’t a whole lot of barriers to entry. The OLCC basically issued a license to anyone who qualified.”Chadowitz blames out-of-state money for flooding the Oregon system. In 2016, state lawmakers decided to lift a restriction that barred out-of-state investors from owning controlling shares of local farms and dispensaries.It was a controversial choice – one that many longtime growers still resent.“The root of the entire thing was allowance of outside money into Oregon,” Chadowitz says. “Anyone could get the money they needed. Unlimited money and unlimited licenses, you’re going to get unlimited flower and crash the market.”As of 1 April, Oregon had licensed 963 recreational cannabis grows, while another 910 awaited OLCC approval.That means oversupply is only going to increase as more farms start harvesting bud.The OLCC has said repeatedly that it has no authority to limit the number of licenses it grants to growers, wholesalers and dispensaries (although by contrast, the number of liquor stores in Oregon is strictly limited).Since voters legalized recreational marijuana in 2014, many industry veterans from the medical marijuana years have chafed at the entrance of new money, warning it would destroy a carefully crafted farm ecosystem.The OLCC remains committed to facilitating a free market for recreational marijuana in which anyone can try their hand at growing or selling.The demand for weed in Oregon is robust – the state reeled in $68m in cannabis sales taxes last year – but it can’t keep pace with supply.Whitney says it’s not unusual for a new industry to attract speculators and people without much business savvy.“Whenever you have these emerging markets, there’s going to be a lot of people entering the market looking for profit,” he says. “Once it becomes saturated, it becomes more competitive. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to cannabis. There used to be a lot of computer companies, but there’s not so many anymore.”Across rolling hills of Oregon farmland and in Portland dispensaries as sleek as designer eyewear shops, the story plays out the same: Business owners can’t make the low prices pencil out.Nick Duyck is a second-generation farmer and owner of 3D Blueberry Farms in Washington county. “I was born and raised on blueberries,” he says.But last June, Duyck launched Private Reserve Cannabis, a weed grow designed to create permanent jobs for seasonal workers.“By starting up the cannabis business,” says Duyck, “it keeps my guys busy on a year-round basis.”He invested $250,000 in the structural build-outs, lighting, environmental controls and other initial costs to achieve a 5,000 sq ft, Tier I, OLCC-approved indoor canopy.Ongoing labor and operational costs added another $20,000 a month.Weed prices were high: Duyck forecast a $1,500 return per pound. If Duyck could produce 20lb of flower a week, he’d make back his money and start banking profits in just three months.October’s bumper crop tore those plans apart.“We got in at the wrong time,” Duyck says. “The outdoor harvest flooded the market.”By the start of the new year, Duyck was sitting on 100lb of ready-to-sell flower – an inventory trickling out to dispensaries in single-pound increments.So he turned to a wholesaler, Cannabis Auctions LLC, which holds monthly fire sales in various undisclosed locations throughout Oregon.Weed auctions operate under a traditional model: sellers submit their wares, and buyers – dispensary owners, intake managers and extract manufacturers – are given an opportunity to inspect products before bidding on parcels awarded to the highest dollar.Duyck sent 60lb of pot to the auction block in December. He had adjusted his expectations downward: he hoped to see something in the ballpark of $400 a pound.It sold for $100 a pound.“The price per pound that it costs us to raise this product is significantly higher than the hundred dollars a pound,” says Duyck. (A little light math points to a $250-per-unit production cost.) “Currently, we’re operating at a $15,000-per-month loss,” Duyck says.If prices don’t improve soon, Duyck says he won’t be able to justify renewing his OLCC license for another year.“The dispensaries that are out there, a lot of them have their own farms, so they don’t buy a lot of product from small farms like us’” Duyck says. “If you really want to grow the product, you almost have to own the store also.”Middlemen – store owners without farms – are also suffering. Take Don Morse, who gave up selling weed on New Year’s Eve.Morse ran Human Collective II, one of the earliest recreational shops in the city, which first opened as a medical marijuana supplier in 2010. At times, Morse stocked 100 strains in his Multnomah Village location.Morse lobbied for legal recreational weed and founded the Oregon Cannabis Business Council.The shift to recreational was costly. With his business partner Sarah Bennett, Morse says he invested more than $100,000 in equipment to meet state regulations.By last summer, new stores were popping up at a rapid pace. Morse’s company wasn’t vertically integrated, which means it did not grow any of its own pot or run a wholesaler that might have subsidized low sales.“Competition around us was fierce, and the company started losing money, and it wasn’t worth it anymore,” Morse says. “At our peak, we had 20 employees. When we closed, we had six.”Morse couldn’t see a way to make the numbers work. Human Collective priced grams as low as $6 to compete with large chains like Nectar and Chalice, but it struggled to turn a profit.“When you’re the little guy buying the product from wholesalers, you can’t afford to compete,” he says. “There’s only so far you can lower the price. There’s too much of everything and too many people in the industry.”So Morse closed his shop: “We paid our creditors and that was that. That was the end of it.”Despite losing his business, Morse stands behind Oregon’s light touch when it comes to regulating the industry.“It’s just commercialism at its finest,” he says. “Let the best survive. That’s just the way it goes in capitalism. That’s just the way it goes.”Just as mom-and-pop grocery stores gave way to big chains, people like Morse are losing out to bigger operations.Chalice Farms has five stores in the Portland area and is opening a sixth in Happy Valley. La Mota has 15 dispensaries. Nectar has 11 storefronts in Oregon, with four more slated to open soon.Despite the record-low prices in the cannabis industry, these chains are hiring and opening new locations, sometimes after buying failed mom-and-pop shops.The home page on Nectar’s website prominently declares: “Now buying dispensaries! Please contact us if you are a dispensary owner interested in selling your business.”Nectar representatives did not respond to a request for comment.Because the federal government does not recognize legal marijuana, the industry cannot access traditional banking systems or even federal courts. That means business owners can’t declare bankruptcy to dissolve a failed dispensary or farm, leaving them with few options. They can try to liquidate their assets, destroy the product they have on hand and eat the losses.Or they can sell the business to a company like Nectar, often for a fraction of what they’ve invested.Deep-pocketed companies can survive the crash and wait for the market to contract again.Oregon faces another consequence of pot businesses closing up shop: leftover weed could end up on the black market.Already, Oregon has a thriving illegal market shipping to other states.US attorney for Oregon, Billy Williams, has said he has little interest in cracking down on legal marijuana businesses, but will prosecute those shipping marijuana to other states.“That kind of thing is what’s going to shut down our industry,” Chadowitz says. “Anything we can do to prevent Jeff Sessions from being right, we have to do.”Ask someone in the cannabis industry what to do about Oregon’s weed surplus, and you’re likely to get one of three answers.The first is to cap the number of licenses awarded by the OLCC. The second is to reduce the canopy size allotted to each license – Massachusetts is trying that. And the last, equally common answer is to simply do nothing. Let the market sort itself out.Farmers, such as Walker of East Fork Cultivars, argue that limiting the number of licensed farms in Oregon would stunt the state’s ability to compete on the national stage in the years ahead.“We’re in this sort of painful moment right now,” says Walker, “but I think if we let it be a painful moment, and not try to cover it up, we’re going to be better off for it.”Walker and other growers hope selling across state lines will someday become legal.Every farmer, wholesaler, dispensary owner and economist WW talked to for this story said that if interstate weed sales became legal, Oregon’s oversupply problem would go away.Under the current presidential administration, that might seem a long shot. But legalization is sweeping the country, Donald Trump is signaling a looser approach, and experts say Oregon will benefit when the feds stop fighting.“The thing about Oregon is that it is known for its cannabis, in a similar way to Oregon pinot noir,” Whitney says. “For those who are able to survive, they are positioned extremely well not only to survive in the Oregon market but also to take advantage of a larger market – assuming things open up on a federal level.”Looking for more great work from the Portland, Oregon, alt-weekly paper and website Willamette Week?

Yesterday was really a powerful sprint on a really steep climb,” said Battaglin, who also won Giro stages in 2013 and 2014. “Today was a steep climb but at two kilometres to go, and I had a little bit of time to rest and recover and do a really good sprint.”Visconti crossed second and José Gonçalves of Portugal finishedthird, both with the same time as Battaglin.Battaglin clocked slightly more than four hours over the 153-kilometre (95-mile) leg from Agrigento to Santa Ninfa in southwestern Sicily.The start of the stage was delayed for 15 minutes due to an accident on the racing route that left a motorcycle driver in serious condition.Simon Yates, the Briton who won the young rider classification at last year’s Tour de France, sits third overall 17 seconds behind Dennis, who claimed the lead after the second stage.“It was a nice day on the bike, on quite a slow pace because of the head wind,” said Dennis, an Australian with BMC. “I felt a bit of stress every now and then but I am glad to be in the Maglia Rosa. We’re only on day five, that means 16 days to go. Tomorrow will be another story with the Etna. I’m looking forward to see how I’ll go up there.”Stage six concludes with an arduous ascent up Mount Etna that should shake up the overall standings. Then the race heads over to mainland Italy and climbs up the peninsula to the defining legs in the Alps.The only overall contender who struggled on Wednesday was Astana rider Miguel Ángel López, who misjudged a turn with six kilometers to go, rode straight off the road and fell into a patch of high grass. He finished 42 seconds behind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd319bd00dd469114d4089006ca1ba00c333b08a/0_58_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c4e70080464553e57e47fee3e6ce8d8","title":"kyle edmumd pulls off shock victory over novak djokovic madrid open tennis","story":"Britain’s Kyle Edmund secured one of the biggest victories of his career by defeating the former world No\u0026nbsp1 Novak Djokovic in the second round of the Madrid Open.Edmund had never won a set in his previous three matches against Djokovic but deservedly came out on top in a high-quality contest lasting an hour and 42 minutes.The 23-year-old Briton saved three break points in the deciding set to seal a 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 victory and set up a meeting with the eighth seed, David Goffin, in the last 16. Edmund made the ideal start with a break of serve in the opening game and, although Djokovic immediately hit back, Edmund broke twice more to take the first set.Djokovic looked to be getting back to somewhere near his best as he took the second set in style to set up a decider, but Edmund recovered from 0-40 down in the fifth game to remain in front and then claimed the decisive break before serving out for the match.“It was a great experience first of all to beat Novak, I’ve lost to him three times,” Edmund told Sky. “He’s a legend so your first match when you share the court is an\u0026nbspexperience but now, especially after reaching the semis of the Australian Open, it’s time to try and beat these guys and I was very pleased today how I managed my game, especially in the\u0026nbspthird set.The win is likely to take Edmund, who has risen to British No\u0026nbsp1 during the extended absence of Andy Murray, inside the world’s top\u0026nbsp20 for the first time next week. “It was a goal of mine to get inside the top 20, there’s no reason why I couldn’t,” he said. “You have to set targets and I thought that was a very realistic target, so I’m pleased it’s happened.

It wasn’t about results, it was about if I can give myself a chance.“I put myself in the final group of the first major of the year and it didn’t quite work out but if I can put myself in the final group of some other events coming up, then I’ll have some recent experience and hopefully I’ll deal with it a bit better.“I’ve got so many opportunities. I’m playing well, my game’s in good shape. We have got this event here, I’ve never won this, I would love to put this on my CV. We have got the other three major championships, everything else to play for, FedExCup, whatever. We’re not even halfway through the season.“It was disappointing that I didn’t get the result I wanted at Augusta but I took a lot of positives from the fact that I probably didn’t have my best stuff and I still was able to play my way into the final group and contend.McIlroy can also, of course, take solace from the fact he has already won this year, at the Arnold Palmer Invitational. And should the 29-year-old need evidence of how the Players can transform attitudes, he needs only look at a Ryder Cup team-mate.Ian Poulter’s share of second place here 12 months ago revived a career that had looked in danger of flatlining. The competitive fires fuelled by the Englishman’s Sawgrass performance led to his victory at the Houston Open last month.“He went through a tough time with injury and then he had a couple other things happen in his life that I think were quite trying for him,” McIlroy said. “So to see him come through the other side of it and win in Houston was really cool. I was really happy for him.“He’s played really well this year, and he seems like he’s came out with a lot of motivation and determination. I don’t think it’s a coincidence it’s a Ryder Cup year, but I’m so happy for him. Poults is one of the best guys out here. He’s great company.”A reinvigorated Poulter has been afforded opportunity to reset his career targets at the age of 42. “I feel I’ve got a lot more in me to give,” he said. “With that in mind, I think I can still win big tournaments. I still think I can win a major. Other guys have done that over the age of 42 and I would like to think I still can.“To play free, to have goals fresh in your mind, long-term goals, is a good position rather than week-to-week goals. It takes a lot of pressure off you.”Another player who will not lack motivation this week is Justin Rose. The Englishman could leap to No\u0026nbsp1 in the world rankings – a position he has never held before – with victory here. Rose’s compatriot, Paul Casey, withdrew on Wednesday because of a back injury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893041489eefcfccf7d927339d5db05b58ba3647/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05387a7d622ae687592c7590c1c14a87","title":"harlem renaissance new york art food history","story":"The Harlem EatUp! food festival starts on 14 May – just one opportunity residents and enthusiastic newcomers have to celebrate and develop the culture of this historic New York districtIt was after midnight on a Wednesday and Paris Blues, Harlem’s oldest surviving jazz bar, was standing-room only. The e has remained, stubbornly, much the way it has since it opened in 1969. There’s neither a cover charge nor fancy cocktails and patrons can help themselves to barbecued chicken and other comfort food for free. In the corner, Samuel Hargress Jr, the 81-year-old owner who lives on the premises, was holding court in a fedora and tweed jacket.“I’m old-old-school. Things are real different now to when I came along,” he said. Since purchasing the bar for $35,000, Hargress has been a central figure in one of New York’s most historic – and rapidly changing – neighbourhoods. Though his establishment maintains a local following, these days it’s famous enough to attract international visitors. “You’ve got people from all over. Everybody here’s partying and dancing. They don’t know each other but it don’t matter.”Harlem’s history has long been marked by waves of new arrivals and change. Over the years, it has been home to everyone from George and Ira Gershwin to Duke Ellington. Before it became a haven for African-American intellectuals, poets and musicians during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and 30s it was a stronghold of Jewish luminaries, many of whom were displaced by rapid development on the Lower East Side. After a period of decline in the 1970s and 80s, the neighbourhood is once again a hotbed of cultural activity.“It’s an evolving community. I’ve been here since 1980 and it didn’t just change overnight,” says John Reddick. A Harlem historian and preservationist, Reddick leads neighbourhood walking tours.“A lot of tourists have all this baggage and it takes a certain willingness to get beyond that. They think I’m just showing them the nicer side of Harlem, even though these buildings have been here for more than 100 years. I get this all the time: ‘Where in Harlem should you not go?’ There’s nowhere in Harlem I would not go.”Reddick urges visitors and newcomers to make a more meaningful connection with the existing community, whether by visiting a local church or enjoying the free art and live performances at Marcus Garvey park, St Nicholas park and Jackie Robinson recreation centre. Above all, he hopes that everyone who comes gains an appreciation for the neighbourhood’s near-mythic quality and what that has meant for different generations.“Look out of your window and it’s like this Fred Astaire-and-Ginger-Rogers view,” he says. “There’s this exhilaration of being in Harlem this sense that you’re part of this great metropolis. I feel it now, so you can imagine what it must have been like in the 1920s or 30s for somebody such as the poet Langston Hughes.”While there is much that Hughes would still recognise, it is impossible to ignore some of the changes. As with almost any neighbourhood in Manhattan, particularly one marked by handsome, turn-of-the-century brownstones and broad boulevards, Harlem’s property values have skyrocketed, causing residents to question what the future holds. A recent attempt by developers to rebrand the desirable area between 110th Street and 125th Street as SoHa resulted in a backlash by activists. Yet despite the Whole Foods on 125th Street and the queasy spectacle of a townhouse going for more than $4m, Harlem and its cultural institutions have managed to hold on to a distinct identity.“Harlem, throughout all the waves of gentrification and forced migration, has maintained a sense of itself,” says Nico Wheadon, director of public programmes and community engagement at the Studio Museum on 125th Street, which showcases work by African-American artists. “That’s because in its essence, it is an artistic, creative place. There is a history of struggle and protest to maintain that.” As with the National Black Theatre, another important Harlem institution, the Studio Museum turns 50 this year.Some of the efforts to maintain a sense of community have been quieter endeavours such as The Laundromat Project, which provides support for local artists and hosts programmes in laundromats and other public spaces. Another small startup is Hot Bread Kitchen, a non-profit project based in La Marqueta in East Harlem that provides female immigrants facing economic insecurity with a living wage, job training, and support.Meanwhile, the Studio Museum is in the process of redefining itself, moving beyond the walls and connecting with the broader public through art installations in parks and libraries, creative workshops talks, and even dance parties, such as its popular summer series, Uptown Fridays! Though the museum has shut its doors (there are plans to demolish the existing property and rebuild on the same site) it remains an active part of the community, including as its links with El Museo del Barrio, a Spanish Harlem art showcase.As with many Harlem residents, Wheadon finds the neighbourhood fulfils most of her social and entertainment needs. For an evening out, she heads to Vinatería, a stylish Mediterranean spot or 67 Orange Street for cocktails. She’s equally in love with the classics, from the amateur nights at the Apollo Theater to live music at Showman’s Jazz Club (375 West 125th Street), which she says feels “like the Harlem that I imagined before I moved here. It’s a time warp.”Change has, in part, been driven by Harlem’s thriving culinary scene. At its forefront is Marcus Samuelsson, the celebrity chef behind the Red Rooster restaurant, its subterranean sister venue, Ginny’s Supper Club and the Streetbird Rotisserie. Born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, Samuelsson spent eight years learning about the neighbourhood prior to opening Red Rooster, attending church events, eating at places such as Silvia’s – a soul-food staple opened in 1962 – and listening to residents.“When you think about the Studio Museum or the National Black Theatre, you’re thinking about this incredible depth of art, of music. We want this to be a destination for food as well,” Samuelsson says. “For me it was about working where you live and creating jobs to restore your community.”Samuelsson’s talk of community is more than lip-service. He works closely with the Careers through Culinary Arts Program, a programme that helps disadvantaged teens enter the restaurant industry and is an integral part of Harlem EatUp!, an annual food festival that highlights both established chefs and small-time food entrepreneurs. Samuelsson respects the older establishments, though he does not view the broader range of options as inherently negative.“You have ramen restaurants now, you have mixologist bars, you have craft coffee and I think that’s great. A community should be able to have both. You want it to be a place where people who live there don’t have to leave to go to a great place,” he says.Likewise, Wheadon feels optimistic that the neighbourhood will continue to hold onto that in the future.“Someone asked me the other day: ‘What is blackness to you?’ I said: ‘It’s celebration.’ I can’t walk to or from work without being swept up in somebody’s something,” she says. “There’s something beautiful about that and I think that Harlem will always have an element of that.”At Paris Blues the scene was certainly one of celebration. As the night wore on, musicians from nearby bars stopped by to jam with the band. Although Hargress is constantly approached with offers from developers, he has no intention of retiring or selling the joint.“I have fun with them. One guy offered me $6m,” he said, adding with unrestrained glee, “So I told him, you come up with $10m, then maybe you can call me back.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d923a1b967a417403fea3166a84a4b4adfdbeac/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3baa62f4a694f58c753f9f72a9dfd80","title":"hawaiis kilauea volcano erupts in pictures","story":"The eruption of Kilauea volcano has sent lava flowing into residential areas on Hawaii’s Big Island, with residents ordered to abandon their homes.

The attorney general, Jeremy Wright, is expected to make a statement to MPs on Thursday, and Belhaj, now a military commander in Libya, will make a statement in Istanbul shortly afterwards.It is unclear what the agreed terms are, although Belhaj has in the past said he would settle for just £3 – £1 from each of the defendants, as long as he and his wife also received an apology from the British government.The couple had been suing the former foreign secretary Jack Straw, and Sir Mark Allen, the former head of counter-terrorism at MI6, as well as the agency itself and the Foreign Office.The couple’s lawyers have also brought judicial review proceedings against the Crown Prosecution Service after prosecutors concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against Allen following a four-year Scotland Yard investigation.Among the evidence obtained by Yard detectives was a faxed letter from Allen to Gaddafi’s intelligence chief, Moussa Koussa in which he made clear that MI6 had tipped off the Libyans about the couple’s whereabouts prior to their kidnap. In the letter, Allen congratulated Koussa on the “safe arrival” of Belhaj. “This was the least we could do for you and for Libya to demonstrate the remarkable relationship we have built over recent years.” He added that “amusingly”, the CIA – which had provided the aircraft for the rendition operation – had asked that MI6 channel all requests for information from Belhaj through them.“I have no intention of doing any such thing. The intelligence … was British. I know I did not pay for the air cargo. But I feel I have the right to deal with you direct on this.”In an interview with the , Boudchar described how she had been taped head-to-toe to a stretcher for the 17-hour flight to Tripoli. “My left eye was closed when the tape was applied. But my right eye was open, and it stayed open throughout the journey. It was agony.” Nearby, she could hear the grunts of pain of her husband, who had been shackled into a stressful position. Boudchar was four-and-a-half months pregnant at the time that she was kidnapped. She was set free shortly before giving birth.Two weeks after the couple were renditioned to Libya, Tony Blair paid his first visit to the country, embracing Gaddafi and declaring that Libya had recognised “a common cause, with us, in the fight against al-Qaida extremism and terrorism”. Simultaneously, in London, the Anglo-Dutch oil company Shell announced it had signed a lucrative deal for gas exploration rights off the Libyan coast. Three days after that, a second opponent of Gaddafi, Sami al-Saadi, was bundled onboard a plane in Hong Kong and taken to Tripoli in a joint British-Libyan rendition operation. Saadi’s wife and four children were also kidnapped and taken to Libya. The youngest was a girl aged six. The family was incarcerated at Tajoura for more than two months before being released. Saadi and Belhaj were held for more than six years, however, and say they were subjected to torture throughout this time.Al-Saadi settled his claim against the British government in 2012, receiving £2.2m in an out-of-court payment.Other documents discovered during the Libyan revolution make clear that information extracted from Belhaj was then used to justify the detention in Britain of members of his Islamist opposition group, the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, some of whom had settled in the UK as refugees many years earlier.Before the two families had been kidnapped, the UK and US governments had been pressing Gaddafi to abandon his nuclear and chemical weapons programmes, which he pledged to do in December 2003.It is not yet clear whether the settlement will also terminate the judicial review challenge of the CPS decision not to prosecute Allen. Both the former MI6 officer and Straw deny any wrongdoing."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3488974.1525855023!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"apartments planned for south dublin branded a monstrosity","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            An architect’s drawing of the proposed apartment complex beside the Golden Ball pub in Kilternan. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Georgian-style apartments planned for Kilternan.Residents in south Dublin have objected to plans for a six-storey Georgian-style apartment scheme at the foot of the Dublin mountains in Kilternan on the grounds it would be “totally unsuitable” for the local rural area.Developer Greg Kavanagh’s Calerotech Ltd has sought planning permission from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for the complex of 97 apartments at the Golden Ball pub. If granted permission it would be the first apartment scheme in Kilternan.The design of the complex “seeks to delve into a portion of the nation’s richest historical architectural heritage” the application states, and is based on the Custom House and the “Georgian Squares of Dublin” according to the developers. It also represents a “back to basics” approach in terms of design, Calerotech said.Local resident Anne-Marie Leen described the scheme as a “monstrosity of a development” which is “totally unsuitable to the areas and is only at best suitable for a city centre location, and probably not suitable in Ireland at all”.The apartments would not be in keeping with the “countrysidevillage feel” of Kilternan, she said.Another local, Ciarán Moulton, said the scheme would “adversely effect the views to the Dublin mountains enjoyed by local residents”, would worsen local traffic, and affect visibility on the main road.The Balally Residents Association said the height and scale of the development was “more aligned to a city – not a rural suburb”. It would increase the already “massive traffic delays” and the pressure on the Luas Green line, it said.Several residents emphasised the low-rise nature of the area, which is dominated by bungalows and two-storey houses, and said the additional traffic would damage air quality and affect the health of existing residents.In relation to the scale, Calerotech said when Dublin’s Georgian squares were first planned they were considered “too urban” for their locations, and that 60 years ago “ Cabra, Crumlin, Ballymun etc” were mostly green fields.Local Fine Gael Cllr John Kennedy made a submission in favour of the scheme which he said appeared a more “family friendly” size than most apartment schemes in Dublin“The ornate design of the exterior is of a significantly higher standard than typical apartment scheme designs and would be reminiscent of well-regarded architecture seen in London and Paris,” he said.“I think it would be unlikely that a better designed scheme would ultimately materialise in future on these lands.”Mr Kavanagh, the self-described “Ronaldo of the property market” 18 months ago left New Generation Homes, the high profile development company he founded with Pat Crean. New Generation made headlines from 2011 onwards when it spent up to €300 million buying up development land at the bottom of the market.Submissions on the Kilternan plan can be made to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council until Thursday."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Environmental group critical of State\u0026rsquos failure to clean areas including former steelworks siteAction taken by court-appointed administrator of the estate against widow Sally CoxGarda\u0026iacute investigating invoice redirect frauds that targetted Spanish and Irish firmsMan (30) broke into woman\u0026rsquos home while drunk and then abducted their daughterPro Life Campaign, Save the Eighth and Iona Institute say move \u0026lsquoshutting down\u0026rsquo fair debateFamily of \u0026lsquodisappeared\u0026rsquo IRSP man pleads for information on other abducteesSF leader raises case of Kerry woman who is terminally ill and angry after false negativeMarathon runner Tomasz Wojciechowski claims neck injured in Phoenix Park collisionJudge says scar left after incident noticeable as Conor Casey has \u0026lsquoshort modern haircut\u0026rsquoDubliner (37) has pleaded not guilty to murder of David Douglas on July 1st, 2016Sgt Jim Molloy says Supt David Taylor had a \u0026lsquotendency to gossip and chitchat in the office\u0026rsquoAttempted-murder accused displayed delusionary beliefs, court toldHiqa says abuses at \u0026Aacuteras Attracta in Co Mayo were a \u0026lsquowake-up call\u0026rsquo for regulationObstetrician says claim St Luke\u0026rsquos Hospital to open abortion clinic \u0026lsquoabsolute nonsense\u0026rsquoHundreds of mourners gathered to celebrate the life of teenager who appeared on RT\u0026Eacute\u0026rsquos Room to ImprovePosters depicting Minister\u0026rsquos face alongside aborted foetus erected near his Wicklow homeIrish Rail says attack \u0026lsquoexposes the lie that graffiti vandals are engaged in some sort of artistic endeavour\u0026rsquoLess than half the women calling CervicalCheck helpline have received a call back"},{"url":null,"title":"peston ireland has undermined britain for over 100 years","story":"  May 6, 2018TV presenter Robert Peston makes the claim during interview with Jacob Rees-Mogg   May 9, 2018TV presenter moves to clarify controversial remarks made on his Sunday programme "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"PM Najib Razak\u0026rsquos party loses seats in key states, raising prospect he could be voted outUS secretary of state returning with \u0026lsquothree wonderful gentlemen\u0026rsquo, says TrumpDual citizens are blocked from national elected office under Australia\u0026rsquos 117-year-old constitutionMeeting signals China\u0026rsquos desire for influence ahead of planned Kim-Trump summitChongqing party boss Sun Zhengcai took millions in bribes, court saysAhsan Iqbal (59) is attacked by a gunman during an election rally in Punjab provincePresident says philosopher\u0026rsquos theory still holds true on 200th anniversaryWorkers have started to restore electricity as homes, crops extensively damaged herds killedLiu Xia despairs as talks to free her from house arrest appear to stallMany of the deceased hit by collapsing walls, trees in north and west of countryAnti-ship and surface-to-air systems set-up on reclaimed land in South China Sea, reports sayIndian court tells government to enlist overseas specialists to fix pollution damageReuters journalists working on investigation into killing of Rohingya men and boys were arrested in DecemberAustralian Cardinal is most senior Vatican official to be charged over sex abuse in Catholic ChurchCase brings fresh attention to abuse of power by mighty \u0027chaebol\u0027 conglomeratesCardinal is most senior Catholic official to be tried on such allegationsWang Yi travels to Pyongyang days after landmark summit with South KoreaForeign observers will be permitted to view dismantling of nuclear facilitiesSpecialist fire crews called in to deal with smell at Royal Melbourne Institute of TechnologyState media says discussions wrapped up with amicable \u0026lsquofeelings of blood relatives\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3489187.1525873686!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north korea frees three us citizens during mike pompeo visit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un meeting former CIA director and now US secretary of state Mike Pompeo in Pyongyang over the 2018 Easter weekend. Photograph: US governmentAFPGetty ImagesNorth Korea has released three American detainees in a goodwill gesture ahead of a planned summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, the US president tweeted, and they are on their way home with secretary of state Mike Pompeo.“I am pleased to inform you that secretary of state Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the three wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health,” Mr Trump said in tweet.The three US detainees are a Korean-American missionary Kim Dong-chul, and teachers Kim Sang-duk and Kim Hak-song. All had been working in North Korea and were accused of “hostile acts against the country and were being held as “prisoners of war”.“Also, good meeting with Kim Jong-un. Date and place set,” Mr Trump tweeted. He said he would be there to greet the men on arrival and described it as “very exciting”.The summit is expected to take place in late May or early June and there is speculation it could take place in Panmunjom, a peace village on the South Korea side of the demilitarised zone (DMZ) iding the two countries.Mr Pompeo earlier held talks in the Koryo Hotel in the North Korean capital with Kim Yong-chol, who heads up the United Front Department handling inter-Korean relations.“For decades, we have been adversaries. Now we are hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve,” Mr Pompeo said.Mr Kim, who is a former spy chief, said: “I have high expectations the United States will play a very big role in establishing peace on the Korean peninsula.”This was Mr Pompeo’s second visit to North Korea in less than six weeks.The only American released so far by North Korea during Mr Trump’s presidency was Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old student who returned to the US in a coma last year after 17 months in captivity and died days later.Senior leaders from the region met in Tokyo to discuss the forthcoming summit, including Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean president Moon Jae-in and Chinese premier Li Keqiang.Mr Li said the countries involved should “seize the opportunity to promote denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula”, according to a report on the official Xinhua news agency reported.President Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un held their second meeting in two months earlier this week in the Chinese city of Dalian, during which Mr Kim said he hoped for “phased” and “synchronised” measures to realise denuclearisation and lasting peace on the Korean peninsula.Mr Trump and Mr Xi subsequently spoke on the telephone about developments.Mr Abe said his nation would normalise ties with North Korea if the nuclear and missile issues, along with that of the abduction of Japanese citizens, were solved comprehensively.North Korea kidnapped 13 Japanese citizens decades ago to train spies. Five have returned to Japan."},{"url":null,"title":"national geographic travel photographer year 2018 pictures","story":"The competition continues in the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest!

They seem to be in good health, Mr Trump tweeted.News of the possible release of Kim Dong-cheol, Kim Sang-deok and Kim Hak-seong, who have been imprisoned by the rogue regime for between one and three years, began to break via the South Korean media earlier on Wednesday.But the confirmation from Washington only came after the three men were airborne, with the president announcing that they would land at Andrews Air Force Base at 2am. “I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!” he tweeted.The White House said the three men appeared to be in good health and were able to walk on the plane.Pyongyang was reportedly keeping a close eye on the health of the trio to avoid a repetition of the death of American student Otto Warmbier, who died last summer after he was released from a North Korean prison to his family in a mysterious coma.Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, said: President Trump appreciates leader Kim Jong Un’s action to release these American citizens, and views this as a positive gesture of goodwill.The three Americans appear to be in good condition and were all able to walk on the plane without assistance. All Americans look forward to welcoming them home and to seeing them reunited with their loved ones.The US president has hinted at the possible release of the hostages in the last few weeks. Last week Mr Trump tweeted: “As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail. Stay tuned!”However of the three prisoners only one was detained during the previous Obama administration.People watch a TV news report showing portraits of Kim Dong Chul, left, Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song, right in South KoreaKim Dong-cheol, 64, a South Korean-born American pastor, was arrested in North Korea in 2015 on charges of spying and sentenced to 10 years of hard labour.Kim Sang-deok, 59, and Kim Hak-seong, believed to be in his 50s, were both working as academics at Pyongyang’s University of Science and Technology were arrested last year on suspicion of “hostile acts” during heightened tensions over North Korea’s rapidly advancing nuclear and weapons programmes.Following the announcement, the family of Kim Sang-deok, also known as Tony Kim, said they were very grateful for his release.We want to thank all of those who have worked toward and contributed to his return home. We also want to thank the President for engaging directly with North Korea. Mostly, we thank God for Tony\u0027s safe return, they said in a statement.We appreciate all of the support and prayers of friends and even strangers during this challenging year. You are dear to our hearts. We ask that you continue to pray for the people of North Korea and for the release of all who are still being held.US officials, including Mr Pompeo, are believed to have been working for months alongside foreign diplomats to secure their release.The goodwill gesture from Pyongyang comes amid a growing détente between North and South Korea, and ahead of a historic summit between Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, and Mr Trump.Pompeo\u0026#39s visit was not announced until the last minute Mr Pompeo flew to Pyongyang on Tuesday, for his second visit in just two months. Mr Trump also suggested that he had seen Kim Jong-un, who he first met over Easter, and that they had agreed on a date and location for the upcoming summit. The details have not yet been disclosed.The secretary of state assured North Korean leaders that the White House was committed to working with Pyongyang to resolve a standoff over its nuclear weapons and to bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.He extended Washington’s olive branch as he shared lunch with senior official Kim Yong Chol, who is North Korea’s serving director for inter-Korean relations.For decades, we have been adversaries. Now we are hopeful that we can work together to resolve this conflict, take away threats to the world and make your country have all the opportunities your people so richly deserve, Mr Pompeo was quoted as saying by Reuters.Mr Kim responded by expressing high expectations the United States will play a very big role in establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.(The U.S. is) equally committed to working with you to achieve exactly (that),” replied Mr Pompeo. He praised his host for being a “great partner” in laying the groundwork for a summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, which would make him the first sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader.Mr Pompeo’s trip follows a rebuke by North Korea at the weekend over “misleading” claims that President Trump’s maximum political pressure and sanctions drove Pyongyang to the negotiating table.The North’s official news agency quoted a foreign ministry spokesman warning that the claims were a “dangerous attempt” to ruin a budding détente on the Korean Peninsula, after the country’s leader met with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in April.However, international sanctions over its nuclear and missiles programmes have hit North Korea hard over the past year and Kim is believed to be focusing on rebuilding his flagging economy.During a parallel meeting on Wednesday with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, President Moon and Li Keqiang, the Chinese premier, said that North Korea should be guaranteed economic aid if it were to undertake complete denuclearisation.Of all the US nationals held by North Korea over the last 20 years, Mr Kim has spent the longest amount of time in detention.Born in Seoul but a naturalised US citizen, he had been living in China and operated a business in the Rason Special Economic Zone when he was arrested in October 2015, although that was not confirmed until January the following year.He appeared at a stage-managed press conference in March 2016 and confessed to “trying to steal military secrets in collusion with South Koreans”. Seoul has denied any involvement in the case. Mr Kim was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour after being found guilty of espionage and other crimes against the North Korean state. Mr Kim, also known as Tony Kim, is a Korean-American who had just completed a one-month assignment as a guest lecturer in international finance and management at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. Tony Kim was accused of committing unspecified criminal acts intended to overthrow the governmentHe was also involved in humanitarian work in North Korea, including transporting foreign aid to areas of the country hardest hit by the flooding in the summer, which killed more than 500 people and destroyed tens of thousands of homes.Mr Kim and his wife were arrested on April 22, 2017 , shortly before they were due to board a flight at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport. Mr Kim’s wife was subsequently permitted to leave the country, but he has been found guilty of “hostile criminal acts with an aim to subvert the country”. Kim Hak-song was taken into custody on May 7 2017, and has since been accused of carrying out “hostile acts” against the North Korean state.Mr Kim had also been working at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, where he had been involved in agricultural development work. An ethnic Korean, Mr Kim moved to the US from China in the mid-1990s and studied in California. Colleagues described him as being “devoted” to the development of the North’s agricultural sector so the nation could become self-sufficient in basic foods. Foreigners detained by North KoreaPlease review our commenting policyComment: The twisted, forgotten battlefield that explains Iran\u0026#39s nuclear ambitionsIranian MPs set US flag ablaze in parliament as hardliners rejoice over US withdrawal from nuclear dealProtests after investigative journalist Olivera Lakic shot and injured in MontenegroRoman Polanski\u0026#39s lawyer threatens legal action after director is expelled from Oscars bodyDonald Trump warns Iran of \u0026#39very severe consequences\u0026#39 if nuclear programme is restartedDonald Trump\u0026#39s CIA nominee Gina Haspel says she would not follow presidential order to waterboardIndia rejects deal on return of illegal immigrants from UK amid fears of mass deportationsBeavers reduce river pollution by building dams, study showsBallerinas forced to sew their own tutus after thieves steal £20k costumes during showcase tourMahathir Mahathir, 92, claims win over ruling coalition in Malaysia electionsCare home group to pay £2m in compensation after charging thousands in upfront fees You\u0026#39re not immortal, pathologist tells young people after student\u0026#39s ecstasy deathPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s Royal wedding 2018: date, details and latest newsLead singer of rock band reported missing three hours after urging fans to \u0026#39hug their loved ones\u0026#39Brigitte Macron \u0026#39angry\u0026#39 after claims she was behind \u0026#39revolutionary\u0026#39 anti-ageing wrinkle creamComment: Trump is hoping his good cop, bad cop tactics will force Iran into a new dealLake District mountains to be graded like ski runs after rise in hiker deathsWhat time is the Royal wedding?

These cars may be affected by an electrical fault which could cause the engine to cut out completely while on the road.BMW advert banned for condoning dangerous and irresponsible drivingBMW drivers voted rudest on the roadsThe motor company first issued a recall after the death of Narayan Gurung, a former Gurkha soldier who was killed when his car crashed into a tree after he swerved to avoid a broken down BMW.A spokesperson for BMW said: “BMW is expanding the existing B+ battery connector UK recall. This relates to predecessor generations of the 1 Series, 3 Series, Z4 and X1 built between March 2007 and September 2011.“BMW will be contacting all affected customers by post advising them of how they can book their car in to have the work carried out. We will commence contacting affected customers in the next three weeks.” The car manufacturer said the work should take no more than two hours, and there will be no cost to the customer.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said the recall raised “serious questions about the adequacy of the car recall system in this country”. “Drivers will be asking why it took so long for BMW to fully recall these potentially dangerous cars in the UK, several years later than recalls around the same fault in a number of other countries,” Mr Neill said.“The government must ensure that the DVSA has the powers that it needs to hold manufacturers to account and protect road-users from the dangers of unsafe vehicles.” Mwape Kambafwile said he stopped driving his BMW 3 Series car after it cut out completely while he was driving in December 2016.He said: “I just thought to myself if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous.“I took it to BMW. The next day they called me to say they had found a fault, it looks like the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box. I felt so uncomfortable driving it that we took taxis, I walked to work every day.

These cars may be affected by an electrical fault which could cause the engine to cut out completely while on the road.BMW advert banned for condoning dangerous and irresponsible drivingBMW drivers voted rudest on the roadsThe motor company first issued a recall after the death of Narayan Gurung, a former Gurkha soldier who was killed when his car crashed into a tree after he swerved to avoid a broken down BMW.A spokesperson for BMW said: “BMW is expanding the existing B+ battery connector UK recall. This relates to predecessor generations of the 1 Series, 3 Series, Z4 and X1 built between March 2007 and September 2011.“BMW will be contacting all affected customers by post advising them of how they can book their car in to have the work carried out. We will commence contacting affected customers in the next three weeks.” The car manufacturer said the work should take no more than two hours, and there will be no cost to the customer.Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said the recall raised “serious questions about the adequacy of the car recall system in this country”. “Drivers will be asking why it took so long for BMW to fully recall these potentially dangerous cars in the UK, several years later than recalls around the same fault in a number of other countries,” Mr Neill said.“The government must ensure that the DVSA has the powers that it needs to hold manufacturers to account and protect road-users from the dangers of unsafe vehicles.” Mwape Kambafwile said he stopped driving his BMW 3 Series car after it cut out completely while he was driving in December 2016.He said: “I just thought to myself if I was driving on the motorway with my family in the car, that could have been very dangerous.“I took it to BMW. The next day they called me to say they had found a fault, it looks like the cable had burnt out and no current was passing through the fuse box. I felt so uncomfortable driving it that we took taxis, I walked to work every day.

Sales dropped by 3.1 per cent compared with April last year, the sharpest decline recorded by the BRC and the auditor KPMG since they began monitoring retail performance in 1995. While the figure for last month was affected by the early timing of Easter this year – with shoppers doing more buying in March, ahead of the spring holiday – economists still deemed the data a “weak report”. Sharp drop in retail job vacancies as high street crisis deepensFive things that show how online retailing will transform our lives“It is extremely rare for total sales to fall outright December 2008 was the last time our calendar-adjusted measure of total sales fell for two consecutive months,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Continued weakness in sales in April can’t be pinned on the weather – average temperatures actually were 1.1 degrees celsius above their 1970-2017 April average – or any other one-offs.”Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, said: “April’s figures show retail sales growth falling off a cliff, with sales down 3.1 per cent on last year, but we must exercise caution and remember that the timing of Easter makes meaningful month-on-month comparisons difficult. That said, the three-month average is more helpful to assess, but this too points to sales only growing modestly – these are indeed testing times for retailers.”Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said consumers’ discretionary spending power remains under pressure and added: “The reality is that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.” However, Mr Tombs warned: “The widely anticipated revival in growth in consumer spending is not emerging this year. While wages are no longer falling in real terms, households’ incomes were hit in April by another round of austerity measures and a rise in minimum pension contributions. “In addition, the rise in (interest rates) in November has prompted households to take a more cautious approach to borrowing and has hit the housing market hard, depressing consumers’ confidence.” Pantheon Macroeconomics is predicting that households’ real spending growth will slow to 0.8 per cent in 2018, down from 1.7 per cent last year. Analysts at Shore Capital were more optimistic, and said: “We are encouraged that UK living standards are stabilising as real wages are now broadly matching inflation.”However, they pointed to continued tough trading conditions on the UK high street, and highlighted how polarised trading performances have become among retailers, with weaker brands either folding or being forced to cut back to capacity as consumers increasingly do their shopping online. The BRC’s Ms Dickinson said: “The retail industry is undergoing an unprecedented period of change, the impact of which is being laid bare for us all to see across the nation’s high streets. Retailers are reacting to this change to ensure it represents a positive reinvention of our industry, investing in technology and innovation and providing digital training to employees to improve the customer experience.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They did so this year with added piquancy because it was the 50th anniversary of the famous “Mai 68” when, in the Latin Quarter of Paris, the Left Bank, the whole month was devoted to riotous assembly led by students. In contemplating these events, I recall Wordsworth’s often quoted phrase: “Bliss it was in that dawn to be alive” – unless, of course, you were struck by a cobblestone hurled by a student demonstrator or soaked and knocked off balance by a police water cannon.Presumably those who were demonstrating in Paris last Tuesday have now resumed their normal lives. The point about May 1968, however, is that they didn’t go back to college or to work the next day, they carried on, some of them for the whole month. Why was that? After all, economic growth had been unusually strong, the country was calm, both politically and socially, inflation was weak, living standards had been rising and there was little unemployment.Was it in a way a very 1960s thing? That question is prompted by a French historian of the period, Éric Alary, who observes that “May 68 is seen as a period when audacious moves seemed possible and during which society profoundly changed”. For that is an accurate description of the nature of the 1960s, whether in Western Europe or in North America.At the same time, there was a big rise in the sheer number of young people as a result of an increase in the birth rate in the closing stages of the Second World War and for some years afterwards. Thus, in France, the under-20 cohort rose from 30.7 per cent of the population in 1954 to 33.8 per cent in 1968. At the same time in France (1967), the school leaving age was raised from 14 to 16.  Two men take evasive action during a Paris street riot on 30 May (Getty)This required a massive expansion of teaching staff and building. As a result, students often found themselves being taught by hastily trained teachers in hastily built class rooms. In France, as in Britain, this was followed by a big expansion of the university sector. There was inevitably something ramshackle about it all, and students noticed. Yet the command structures of educational establishments remained unchanged. Nonetheless, universities are never just academic establishments full stop. For their campuses and their indoor and outdoor spaces lend themselves to meetings and debates and even to organising mini demonstrations. The intellectual gods of these 1960s students were Marx, Freud and Sartre, the French existentialist philosopher. In a famous passage, Sartre wrote that “God does not exist, and as a result man is forlorn, because neither within himself nor without does he find anything to cling to”. This struck home. For as Bob Dylan sang in 1965 – “How does it feelHow does it feelTo be on your ownWith no direction homeLike a complete unknownLike a rolling stone?”One had either to start things on one’s own without adult backing, or not at all. This was an unprecedented and intoxicating freedom. As the French student leader Dany Cohn-Bendit told the Paris demonstrators in May 1968: “There are no marshals and leaders today. Nobody is responsible for you. You are responsible for yourselves.”In fact, as is the way of things, Mai 68 began not in central Paris, but in Nanterre, a suburb seven miles to the northwest, and not in May but on 22 March. The construction of the university of Nanterre campus in a bleak shanty town had begun in 1962. In the spring of 1968 it was still not finished. The building were exceedingly functional and contained some 12,000 students. They were particularly shocked to find themselves living and doing their studies in what was in effect a building site. They demanded, too, the right to circulate freely between the residences of males and female students, still forbidden in what one might call pre-1960s style. There was a lot of justified discontent.Daniel Cohn-Bendit  was known as ‘Dany le Rouge’ because of his politics as well as the colour of his hair (Getty)Some 150 students, including far-left groups together with a small number of poets and musicians, occupied a building. The police surrounded it. After publication of the students’ wishes, they left the building without any trouble. But then they took their protest movement to the Sorbonne in the very middle of the Latin Quarter. That was how Mai 68 started.In a drastic action, the authorities shut down the University of Nanterre on 2 May. The students who had decamped to the Sorbonne were bound to think that this was a hostile act, an outbreak of war between the university authorities and the student body. It had been natural to head to the Sorbonne, France’s premier university, which had the prestige of its ancient foundation 700 years earlier. This meant nothing to the police, of course, who invaded the Sorbonne the next day.In response, on 6 May the national students’ union and the union of university teachers organised a protest march. It was one of the key events of the month. The head of the Paris police was obsessed by the need to protect the Sorbonne and its surroundings from a massive invasion by the students. He placed 1,500 officers in defence. But then came 6,000 protesters in waves. Overnight the confrontation was particularly violent. Thousands of cobblestones were ripped up and used as projectiles by the demonstrators. The police responded with teargas grenades. Dozens of gendarmes were taken to hospitals. Students were wrenched from the arms of the police by their colleagues.The next day, students, teachers and increasing numbers of young workers gathered at the Arc de Triomphe to demand that all criminal charges against arrested students be dropped, that the police leave the university and that the authorities reopen Nanterre and the Sorbonne. But negotiations broke down. When the students returned to their campuses to find that the police were still in occupation, a near revolutionary fervour began to grip them.The lyrics of Bob Dylan captured the sense of isolation and alienation felt by many young people (Redferns)The events were broadcast on radio as they occurred, and the aftermath was shown on television the following day. This demonstration of heavy handed police brutality brought on a wave of sympathy for the strikers. Moreover, in a highly significant move, the major union federations called a one-day strike and demonstration for Monday, 13 May. The workers were going to march with the students.They had their own grievances. There had been sporadic industrial trouble since the beginning of the year. More than half of them put in a 48-hour week. They feared that their standard of living had ceased to improve. Unemployment, albeit from a low base, was beginning to rise. As a result this was no longer a Paris event, for workers took to the streets throughout France. Their slogan was “Ten years! That’s enough!” referred to Charles de Gaulle’s long period as president.French politicians Michel Debre and Andre Malraux at the tomb of the unknown soldier, demonstrating their support for De Gaulle (Getty)The events the next day, 14 May, were as important. For workers began occupying factories, starting with a sit-down strike at the Sud Aviation plants near the city of Nantes. If students could occupy their universities, then workers could seize control of their factories. By 16 May, workers had occupied roughly 50 factories throughout France and 200,000 were on strike by 17 May. That figure snowballed to two million workers on strike the following day (18 May) and then ten million, or roughly two thirds of the French workforce on strike the following week (23 May).The unions assumed that the workers simply wanted more pay. So, when they were able to negotiate substantial pay increases with employers’ associations, they thought their job was done. But workers had also demanded the ousting of the De Gaulle government and in some cases demanded to run their own factories.The demonstrations and the strikes went on. Meanwhile on the morning of 29 May, De Gaulle suddenly boarded a helicopter and left the country. He went to the headquarters of the French military in Germany and called a meeting of Council of Ministers for 30 May back in Paris. On that same day, the unions led 400,000 to 500,000 protesters through Paris chanting “Adieu, De Gaulle”. The head of the Paris police carefully avoided the use of force.Sensibly De Gaulle responded by dissolving the National Assembly and calling a new election for 23 June. He ordered the workers to return to work immediately, threatening to institute a state of emergency if they did not. The Communist Party agreed to the holding of the election. Immediately revolutionary feelings began to fade away. The police retook the Sorbonne on 16 June. And the Gaullists won the greatest victory in French parliamentary history.The May days of 1968, it turned out, had been a convulsive moment, nothing more enduring than that. Nonetheless in Wordsworth’s words, “to be young was very heaven”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The European system has a number of technical advantages over the existing generation of GPS and would be operated independently by Europe without reliance on the US.The presentation drawn up by British negotiators outlines how the UK and EU could build a strong security partnership after Brexit, but adds: “The arrangements for any UK cooperation on Galileo are an important test case of the depth of operational cooperation and information sharing envisaged under the security partnership.”British officials said it would be harder for the UK to work closely with the EU on security without full participation in the scheme.The UK negotiators said they want “continued UK participation in the development and operation of the open signal” of the system despite the UK leaving the bloc, as well as access to the private regulated signal for British armed forces.One year to Brexit: What is still needed to complete a deal with the EU?They have also demanded that British defence firms must be allowed to bid for contracts on the EU’s secure network on the same “fair” basis as EU firms despite Britain’s departure.The European Commission has already moved to relocate a backup control centre for Galileo from Britain because of Brexit, with operations underway to relocate it to Spain.Brussels has also moved to lock Britain’s defence industry out of bidding for contracts related to the €10bn (£8.8bn) programme – which prompted the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, to warn that the move would be “detrimental to European security”.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

This short quote from Lorde\u0027s 1982 essay Learning from the 60s\u0026nbspmight not have much to do with professional wrestling but, in many ways, it encapsulated everything that happened in the building - and indeed the ring - that evening.\u0026nbspPro-Wrestling: EVE\u0027s Wrestle Queendom, the largest all-female wrestling show in Europe ever, was a prime example of what a revolution looks like. This wasn\u0027t just a huge step for wrestling, but for women, feminism and equality as a whole. As indy100 detailed last week, EVE\u0027s progressive liberal politics and ethos supporting women\u0027s rights, LGBT+ equality, body positivity and mental health discussions have helped create a wrestling promotion unlike any other.\u0026nbspAs a wrestling fan from the age of six, I\u0027ve seen a lot of events and many at York Hall but, in all honesty, I\u0027ve never experienced anything like what happened at Wrestle Queendom. The energy in the building and the collective sense of being part of something historic resonated with everyone inside. Not only was this a fantastic wrestling show but it was an all-encompassing example of how society can learn to treat everyone better.\u0026nbspWe did it 💚💪🍏 #wrestlequeendom #girlgang #womensrevolution #womenswrestling #womenswrestlingrevolution #feministlondonA post shared by  EVE Wrestling (@prowrestlingeve) on May 7, 2018 at 1:20am PDTThe show started out with EVE co-owner Emily Read addressing the crowd from the stage. Although the show started later than planned, the emphasis on creating a safe space for everyone in attendance was clear from the start. When taking a not-so-subtle dig at WWE\u0027s recent controversial show in Saudi Arabia, Emily demanded that no racism, homophobia, hate speech, body shaming, sexism or harassment would be tolerated.\u0026nbspIt seems bizarre but oddly encouraging that a wrestling company - where staged violence is the main port of call - should be promoting these values. Seriously, other sporting events and music festivals could learn so much from the way EVE value their fans and their safety. It creates an environment where everyone feels comfortable, no matter who they are, and are allowed to enjoy themselves without feeling threatened. Cheer and boo who you want, by all means, but be respectful.As for the actual show, it has potential to be one of the best wrestling shows to take place anywhere on the planet this year. It featured a brutal \u0027War Games\u0027 cage match (the first time a women\u0027s match of this kind has ever happened), a hilarious contest featuring the incredibly charismatic Kris Wolf and Jetta, a breathtaking ladder match, a show-stealing bout between Meiko Satomura and Kay Lee Ray, an international dream battle pitting Viper against Japanese legend Aja Kong and the main-event, which featured possibly the biggest reaction and outpouring of emotion ever heard in York Hall as the inspirational Charlie Morgan defeated Sammi Jayne to win the EVE championship.\u0026nbspThe quality of this show cannot be underestimated and the wrestling community, fans and performers alike, came out to praise the event and what EVE stands for.Besides the wrestling, one of the biggest announcements of the evening was the introducing of the EVE Hall of Fame, which will be housed at the Bishopsgate Institute in London and will champion the shining lights in female wrestling from all over the world.\u0026nbspThe library has one the largest archives of feminist and women\u0027s history, and LGBT+ history and activism, in the UK - and EVE will now have their own place in their hallowed walls. This prestigious moment was confirmed by Emily at Wrestle Queendom, with the first official inductee being British wrestling icon Klondyke Kate.\u0026nbspIf you have any negative preconceptions about what women\u0027s wrestling is or can be I would implore you to go and see an EVE show or check out their online streaming service. This is a genuine grassroots movement\u0026nbspwith a sense of family and with an attitude that should be applied to all walks of life. EVE is uplifting, empowering and promotes positivity for women and any minority through the vehicle of professional wrestling. They will change your opinion on what wrestling can and should be and, judging by Wrestle Queendom, they\u0027re only just getting started.\u0026nbspMore:\u0026nbspA feminist group are trying to ban a game about picking up women for next articleWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Sales dropped by 3.1 per cent compared with April last year, the sharpest decline recorded by the BRC and the auditor KPMG since they began monitoring retail performance in 1995. While the figure for last month was affected by the early timing of Easter this year – with shoppers doing more buying in March, ahead of the spring holiday – economists still deemed the data a “weak report”. Sharp drop in retail job vacancies as high street crisis deepensFive things that show how online retailing will transform our lives“It is extremely rare for total sales to fall outright December 2008 was the last time our calendar-adjusted measure of total sales fell for two consecutive months,” said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “Continued weakness in sales in April can’t be pinned on the weather – average temperatures actually were 1.1 degrees celsius above their 1970-2017 April average – or any other one-offs.”Paul Martin, head of retail at KPMG, said: “April’s figures show retail sales growth falling off a cliff, with sales down 3.1 per cent on last year, but we must exercise caution and remember that the timing of Easter makes meaningful month-on-month comparisons difficult. That said, the three-month average is more helpful to assess, but this too points to sales only growing modestly – these are indeed testing times for retailers.”Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said consumers’ discretionary spending power remains under pressure and added: “The reality is that with only a gradual return to solid growth in real incomes expected, the market environment is likely to remain extremely challenging for most retailers.” However, Mr Tombs warned: “The widely anticipated revival in growth in consumer spending is not emerging this year. While wages are no longer falling in real terms, households’ incomes were hit in April by another round of austerity measures and a rise in minimum pension contributions. “In addition, the rise in (interest rates) in November has prompted households to take a more cautious approach to borrowing and has hit the housing market hard, depressing consumers’ confidence.” Pantheon Macroeconomics is predicting that households’ real spending growth will slow to 0.8 per cent in 2018, down from 1.7 per cent last year. Analysts at Shore Capital were more optimistic, and said: “We are encouraged that UK living standards are stabilising as real wages are now broadly matching inflation.”However, they pointed to continued tough trading conditions on the UK high street, and highlighted how polarised trading performances have become among retailers, with weaker brands either folding or being forced to cut back to capacity as consumers increasingly do their shopping online. The BRC’s Ms Dickinson said: “The retail industry is undergoing an unprecedented period of change, the impact of which is being laid bare for us all to see across the nation’s high streets. Retailers are reacting to this change to ensure it represents a positive reinvention of our industry, investing in technology and innovation and providing digital training to employees to improve the customer experience.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The arrests were often violent, and sometimes with the support of unofficial vigilante forces. Police released Mr Navalny later that evening, but many of his supporters remained in custody throughout the inauguration. Today’s ceremony mainly followed the protocol of previous years, but there were departures. The major innovation was the debut of Mr Putin’s new 12.5bn ruble limousine, the “Kortezh”. But the car would not sweep through central Moscow as six years ago. The image of a depopulated city centre on lockdown that day left an awkward aftertaste, and today there would be no repeat.Instead, Mr Putin’s new limousine made the short trip from his Kremlin offices to the ceremonial halls. Key Putin opponent among hundreds arrested in violent Moscow clashesTrump targets Russian oligarchs and Putin allies in fresh US sanctionsDonald Trump suggested meeting Vladimir Putin at the White HouseTrump ‘tells Vladimir Putin: “If there is an arms race, ‘I’ll win’”Inside, dignitaries included some of Mr Putin’s closest friends, like the former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and American actor Steven Seagal. There were the stars of Russia’s beau monde – from film director Nikita Mikhalkov to rapper Timati. And there was a mix of the stranger symbols of Mr Putin’s rule: biker Alexander Zaldostanov, aka “the surgeon” the uber-loyal head of the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill and the tsar-worshipping, ultra-conservative Natalia Poklonskaya. Pro-Kremlin youth and the heads of the regional electoral commission were also on the guest list. These groups were the sergeants of March’s presidential elections, considered a great success. That vote returned Mr Putin with a 77 per cent share, and proved to be a disaster for the liberal opposition. Looking relaxed, contented, and not without swagger, Mr Putin delivered a short address. The message was simple enough. The president repeated the promises of a decisive technological breakthrough he first made during his state-of-the-nation speech in March. But he was notably less belligerent this time. Nuclear weapons had given way to motherhood, youth and raising living standards. “Russia has been through troubles before,” he said. “And we always rise above them, like a Phoenix.” Later in the day, the president confirmed that, as expected, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev would retain his role as head of the government. According to some sources, Mr Putin was also likely to appoint the liberal reformer Alexei Kudrin to a top economic post. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIranian MPs burning a US flag in the parliament in Tehran.

These will mostly be paid for by increased taxes, given the limited appetite for serious reform.“No one is debating whether to reject crony capitalism, state control of business and the economy, or the confrontation with the West,” said Valery Solovey, professor of the Moscow State Institute for International Relations. “Of course, this is why there will be no real breakthrough”.According to a poll published on Monday by the independent Levada Centre, Russians say welfare and inequality remain the government’s biggest failure to date. The Kremlin fares better when it comes to foreign policy, with half mentioning the return of great power status as Mr Putin’s major achievement. The combination of both factors means political liberalisation is unlikely to be around the corner, Mr Solovey said.“It is too early to make strategic conclusions,” said Mr Solovey. “But if confrontation with the West and social tensions continue on their current trajectory, domestic policy is only going to get tougher.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There is nothing lowlier than a shoe in Japanese culture. Not only do they not wear shoes at home, you also won\u0027t find shoes in their offices.

This is a high-quality piece of art made of cast metal in the shape of a shoe it is not a real shoe, Segev\u0027s publicist said in a statement, according to Yediot Aharonot.On Instagram, however, some of his 72,000 followers offered a different opinion:When you cook at a diplomatic meal, the minimum you can do is enquire about the guest. In Japan, shoes are considered contemptible, they always take off their shoes at the entrance to every home, both for themselves and for others, wrote one person.Another person wrote: you don\u0027t need to know any culture to know that serving shoes at a dinner is WRONG!World news in picturesWorld news in picturesIranian MPs burning a US flag in the parliament in Tehran.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No, these are the views of Labour’s Big Beasts on the Marxist puppet who stole their party.Brighty - The SunThursday’s local elections suggest Brexit will be the battlefield for the next election, with Labour alienating millions who voted Leave.Alastair Campbell and David Blunkett led the attack on Jeremy Corbyn, blaming him for allowing Jew-baiting anarchists and union paymaster Len McCluskey to kill Labour’s dream of power.“If we cannot beat this shambles of a Tory party, we don’t deserve to be in the game,” warned Tony Blair’s old spin doctor.Campbell, a ferocious Remainer, tore into Corbyn for missing open goals over Brexit, Windrush deportees, the Grenfell inferno and the never- ending NHS ­crisis.But he is especially appalled by Labour’s “Militant-style nastiness . . . anti-Semitism . . . and the feeling that some in the leader- ship feel greater animus against Labour supporters than the Tories.”Blunkett’s attack is even more personal. “Jeremy’s ­leadership is going nowhere,” he warns.The ex-Home Secretary blamed Corbyn directly for the wave of anti-Semitism that cost Labour dearly in London and the reign of terror against anyone who dared to speak out.“He could have cauterised the loathsome views of a very small group of far-Left fanatics who joined the party only after he became leader,” fumed Blunkett. “He has fudged and prevaricated.“I’ve seen the personal vitriol activists endure from some Corbyn supporters. I’ve seen the threats of deselection from Len McCluskey.“I’ve seen good Labour MPs traduced and insulted.”Such vicious public attacks from Blairite heroes make nonsense of pundits’ claims that nothing has changed since last week. Labour is in meltdown.Tories bracing themselves for humiliation on Thursday night were let off the hook. Labour’s retreat across swathes of ­Britain prove JC will never be PM. Labour should be 20 points ahead, not level-pegging.They are lumbered with their useless leader. The legion of “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” fans adore him. And who would take over if he stepped aside?Not John McDonnell, for sure.This new blame game exposes the quiet but corrosive civil war tearing Labour apart since Jezza seized the crown.Last year, moderates had been secretly plotting a leadership coup on the assumption Labour would lose the General Election.That was before JC emerged startled but triumphant from Theresa May’s “strong and stable” fiasco.Now the knives are out. And Brexit is splitting Labour as much as it is the Tories.Ex-Europe minister Caroline Flint ripped into Corbyn for siding with Brexit wreckers and using the issue to bash the Tories. Intriguingly, she believes Britain would have voted OUT whenever the referendum was staged in the last ten years — even if Labour had been in power.Now she believes Remainers should accept the voters’ ­verdict and help deliver the best Brexit deal possible.The Doncaster MP aimed her remarks at Corbyn but she might as easily have been talking about Alastair Campbell, who is campaigning for a ­second referendum.“Two-thirds of Labour MPs represent Leave-voting areas,” says Ms Flint. “We are alienating many traditional Labour voters.”Even Corbyn’s own supporters want him to ditch his opportunistic sabotage tactics.Steve Howell, who helped run his 2017 election bid, ­predicted a voter backlash with Labour shut out of power for a decade.“Labour is seen as too Remain,” he said. “We ignore this at our peril. We would hand Leave-voting areas over to the Tories and be destroyed at the next General Election.”Thursday’s elections prove voters of all parties are sick of Westminster shenanigans and will punish the party they blame most for a bad Brexit.Right now, that looks like Labour.“I feel pity for the women and contempt for the men,” she writes. “The man walking in pride, showing us his caught prey.“The law of this country, the law of all countries, should change. Covering a face is literally killing an identity. I would love to see men covered with burkas, for a few hours, when it’s hot.“Let’s ask them, ‘How are you feeling?

They’re following the only possible logic of the Referendum result, the Prime Minister’s own speeches and the Tory manifesto – a document that those remoaning rebels seemed perfectly happy with when they were re-elected off the back of it last year.If a deal between the UK and Brussels stops Britain making independent trade agreements with the rest of the world, or leaves us subject to rules over which we have no say, then it would be a betrayal of the 17.4million people who wanted out of the EU.The Europhile backbenchers know that. If they win this battle, they’ll have succeeded in keeping us in Europe by the back door. They’ll mark it up as a victory, but this isn’t a political game.It would be an insult to democracy and hold our economy back.We must start work on building a truly Global Britain — now.THAT brickies and nurses are now having to scrimp and save for six-figure deposits is nothing short of a national scandal.No recent Government has been willing to grasp this particular nettle.Our housing crisis has been brewing for decades and sorting it will require real radicalism from the new Communities supremo James Brokenshire.He must fight the Nimbys head-on and demand Treasury cash to unleash a building programme.He must also tear up planning laws and look again at the Green Belt. The Tory leadership will be worried about their voters in the shires. But that’s nothing compared to the hit they’ll take for generations if they don’t face up to the challenge.MOTORISTS have been treated like cash cows for far too long.Plans for new “toxic taxes” rub salt in the wound, especially for diesel drivers.It wasn’t that long ago punters were told it was greener to buy diesels, so fining them years later in the name of environmentalism is especially unfair.It must be possible to “go green” without piling misery on hard-working Brits who rely on their motor to get to work, take the kids to school and visit the GP.Time for a u-turn on yet another fuel tax.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heleena wanted to keep her Australian passport so she didnt need a visa every time she went back to visit her elderly mother.The Home Office demanded she re-apply for her right to stay with reams of documents proving her years in Britain, and pay hundreds to do so.Rules were changed in 2006 which required additional information to apply for the right of abode.She had to track down her now ex-husband to get his birth certificate, passport, and proof of her National Insurance payments and every single address shed lived in since she arrived in the UK.After struggling with the situation and being made to feel like an illegal immigrant, she was then forced to hire lawyers which cost her thousands of pounds to work through all the documents.She claimed that officials said she was vulnerable to deportation at the border if she travelled to visit her family in Australia without the right paperwork.I felt suicidal, she revealed today, lashing out at the hostility of the Home Office.I thought, I dont want to live like this. I appreciate living in this country, but I dont feel valued.No one would listen to me.I was told if I didnt pay a certain amount to the Home Office that I could be deported.She claimed staff who she called to try and resolve the dilemma were rude to her and had picked on her case in order to meet the numbers required because she was an easy target.I was white, Im old, and they picked on me, she added.I was being deliberately targeted in order to reach their own targets set by the then-Home Secretary Theresa May without any intelligent thinking as to the consequences on entirely upstanding honest people like myself.Its an abuse of me as a human.After years of battling, Heleena finally secured her British citizenship in February 2017, and now has a British passport too.But she wants an apology from Theresa May and Sajid Javid - and compensation for the years of anxiety and uncertainty.Its all well to say for Theresa May to say that these people gave so much to this country... but you know what? So have I, Heleena said.Ive worked here for years, I had my children here.Why was I treated like this? Its absolutely disgusting.It seems they are only interested in ticking a box.Im not saying I should be treated specially, but I feel like Ive been completely victimised by a system that fails to understand the people.I have every sympathy for the Windrush generation.Last week Amber Rudd was forced to resign after getting swept up in the saga.She had claimed there was no such thing as deportation targets - but leaked letters proved they did and she knew about them.The desperate plight of Windrush generation immigrants has been highlighted in recent weeks after it emerged that thousands had been at risk of deportation for not having the correct documents.Despite coming to Britain in the 1950s and 1960s from Commonwealth countries and had been living here ever since, they had told to produce proof of their right to stay.One was denied NHS treatment for his cancer, and another missed his own mothers funeral because of the bungle.A Home Office spokesperson said today: UKVI staff are committed to providing people with appropriate and timely advice on how to progress their immigration case.Where we receive a complaint about the service provided, we will investigate thoroughly. UKVI use the complaints to constantly review and improve the service."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000391680056.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baldness cure shampoo","story":"Scientists found the therapy promotes speedy sprouting of hair in lab tests.It works by blocking a naturally-occurring protein that kills off growth and plays a key role in male baldness.Experts are “optimistic” the treatment, known as WAY-316606, could one day help millions of men.Researchers found the drug – originally developed for osteoporosis — boosted growth from human hair follicles in just two days.They now hope to carry out clinical trials on blokes with thinning patches.Lead researcher Dr Nathan Hawkshaw, from Manchester University, said: “The fact this new agent, which had never even been considered in a hair loss context, promotes human hair growth is exciting because of its translational potential: it could one day make a real difference to people who suffer from hair loss.“I’m very optimistic it could work. In lab tests, the drug started promoting growth in hair follicles in just two days – that’s pretty quick.“We are looking at using it as a topical treatment, a gel or shampoo that could reach the follicle.”Dr Hawkshaw said there are no known side-effects of the bone drug.The study, published in the journal Public Library of Science Biology, involved hair follicles donated by more than 40 men struggling with baldness.The tissue all started sprouting hair within days of being treated with the drug.Male-pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss, affecting around half of all men by 50 years of age.Currently only two drugs, minoxidil and finasteride, are available to treat the condition.But both have side-effects and do not always work.The only other option to balding blokes is hair transplantation.Scientists have also discovered a new drug that could cure baldness, especially in patients with alopecia.Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center found 75 per cent of patients with moderate to severe alopecia showed significant hair regrowth after taking the drug ruxolitinib.By the end of the treatment the average hair regrowth among patients was 92 per cent.Previous research has found that football players are more likely to go bald as repeated trauma to the hairline can cause chronic inflammation, which in turn can cause alopecia.Male pattern baldness is the most common type of hair loss in men.It is a genetic condition that follows a pattern of a receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown of the head.It is caused by a hormonal and genetic predisposition.Each strand of hair you have sits in a tiny hole in the skin called a follicle.Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair until, eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair.There are several options available to men who suffer from hair loss.Hair transplants: Removing tiny plugs of hair from areas where the hair is continuing to grow and placing them in areas that are balding. The procedure usually requires multiple sessions and may be expensive.Minoxidil: A solution that is applied directly to the scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. It slows hair loss for many men, and some men grow new hair but hair loss will return when you stop using it.Propecia: A drug that interferes with the production of a highly active form of testosterone that is linked to baldness. It slows hair loss. It works slightly better than minoxidil but hair loss will still return when you stop using this medicineOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every paper, that is, except the Labour-supporting .Incredibly, it is exempt.The free Press would reject such control — so new rules would force us to fund any legal claims against us even if we WON. Investigative journalism would be axed overnight as too risky. Hundreds of papers could be bankrupted and thousands of journalists dumped on the dole.The winners would be crooked politicians, tycoons and celebrities — placed in effect beyond scrutiny — and the Labour Party, having silenced its critics.Ed Miliband’s “Leveson 2” is just as bad: ANOTHER public inquiry, at vast cost, to rake yet again over the ashes of Press wrongdoing two decades ago.Even  opposes that.Maybe Miliband missed “Leveson 1” and all the (failed) trials of journalists.Maybe he hasn’t noticed that the Press is fighting for life in a totally new media landscape dominated by Facebook and Google, that it has changed its practices entirely and has a new regulator, IPSO, far more potent than any before it.The truth, though, is that neither Miliband nor Watson really care much about improving Press practices or securing justice for victims of intrusion. They seek revenge for The Sun abandoning Labour in 2009 and then exposing Miliband’s unsuitability to run Britain.They want a tame media “free” to churn out left-wing positions.If these amendments go ahead, the rest of the civilised world will regard Britain with horror.Dictators crush free speech . . . liberal democracies don’t.The Government, to its credit, opposes both proposals. Our free Press is not perfect, nor can it be.But Britain is better for its newspapers, and these toxic plans will damage our country immensely.They must be voted out.They have been unhappy about stories written about them in the past.I too bear the scars of having had tabloid press stories written about my private life.Some of these were inaccurate or purely salacious.That is the price of being in the public eye, although I also know the distress that such coverage can cause to others, particularly the families of those involved.However, the alternative of state controls on the Press is far more damaging and dangerous.The media play a vital role in a free society in exposing wrongdoing and holding governments to account.It is no accident that it is the world’s most authoritarian states which impose strict controls on their media.Britain is seen across the world as a bastion of liberty and human rights.It is essential that we reject these amendments and not put that reputation at risk.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

When I do talks on obesity one of my top ten tips is pay at the pump, don’t go into the kiosk, and people really get that.”Industry claims that regulations on advertising are already tight are a “shocking sham”, MPs were told, as junk food adverts regularly appear on YouTube and Facebook.Dan Parker, an advertising executive turned obesity campaigner, said rules that prohibited online advertising for junk food on sites where more than a quarter of the audience were children were useless.“This code does not include Google, or any search engine,” he said.“It does not include YouTube, it doesn’t include Facebook, Twitter or any other social networks.“It is a shocking sham. If I type My Little Pony into Google, do I see junk food ads? Yes.”Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, said: “My view, which is in line with a consensus of academics, is that advertising has a small impact on food preference.“It has even less impact on overall diet and even less on overweight and obesity.”Obesity levels in the UK have more than trebled in the last 30 years and, on current estimates, more than half the population could be obese by 2050, according to the NHS.About 27 per cent of the UK population is considered obese and a further 34 per cent are considered overweight, according to the latest Government statistics.Carrying excess weight, even if its just a little, has been linked to type 2 diabetes, stroke, heart disease and 11 different types of cancer.World Cancer Research Fund estimates 25,000 cases of cancer could be prevented every year in the UK alone if everyone was a healthy weight.According to the World Health Organisation heart disease was the biggest killer in 2015 followed by stroke, both of which were responsible for 15 million deaths worldwide."},{"url":null,"title":"labours emily thornberry suggests little miss books should be renamed because little implies women are worth less","story":"The Shadow Foreign secretary suggested the Little should be dropped from the female versions of the kids books because it implied that women were less.She told ITVs Good Morning Britain today: I dont like this thing about being little.

Some of the cracks that have appeared have been several feet back from the edge.He said that the selfie culture had increased the danger near rock faces, with people keen to capture a dramatic photograph of themselves.He said: No selfie or photograph is worth risking your life for.It comes after pictures emerged showing parents allowing their toddlers to peer over the edge of the dangerous Beachy Head cliffs for a photo.Coastguards and the local council have put up prominent signs urging members of the public not to stand too close to the cliffs in case of a landslip.Mr Guy added: When standing at the bottom of a cliff, we would always advise people that they shouldnt stand less than the height of the cliff away. That means that if the cliff is 25 metres high, dont go closer than 25 metres towards it.Our advice would always be to take notice of any warning signs and fences in place, be responsible and don’t take an unnecessary risks.In 2012 tourist Charlotte Blackman, 22, was crushed to death when a huge landslip occurred as she walked under the cliffs further along the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site at Burton Bradstock.Tragically, in June last year, South Korean student Hyewon Kim died after taking a trip to the Seven Sisters cliffs alone.She had asked a stranger to take her picture but as she jumped in the air for a shot, the 23-year-old lost her footing and plummeted from the cliff edge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It had been mentioned in a previous school newsletter but I must admit I hadn’t read it properly.I then wrote a status on my personal Facebook page alerting other parents who may have missed the newsletter about what was happening.Myself and others also agreed that the fact the child would be taken away from their friends and given a different ‘lunch’ in a separate room seemed like a punishment to a child and could easily create upset or bullying opportunities.I also find it appalling that if indeed a parent was struggling to pay lunches for whatever reason, it is the child who would suffer.”The school said they reluctantly introduced the policy after a number of parents persistently failed to pay for their kids’ meals - forcing them to write off the money.They insisted pupils with no packed lunch or dinner money are provided with bread and butter, a selection of fruit and vegetables from the salad bar and a choice of milk or water.They apologised for the lack of clarity around the issue and added: “We take utmost care to listen to and help parents and carers who may be experiencing financial difficulties so that we can ensure their child still receives a meal.“For the children who continue to arrive at school with no meal plan in place, we will endeavour to work with the responsible adults, including those who persistently don’t pay, to find the best solution possible.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404690378.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle royal wedding prince harry schoolgirl surprise invitation","story":"Leonora Ncomanzi, 13, met the royal couple when they arrived at her school during their first public visit in December last year.The youngster made such an impression on the American actress, 36, that she promised she would return to the Nottingham Academy to see her for a second time.Palace officials then contacted Leonora and the schools deputy principal to say that they have two tickets for the special occasion at Windsor Castle.Leonora received a number of acting tips from her idol during their brief encounter and she has already picked the dress she will wear when the pair tie the knot.She said: When I found out that I was invited to the wedding, I was speechless.

Iran is getting the direct assistance from the North Koreans.“The Iran regime shares its own experience and expertise with North Korea”The report alleges that Iran pays the impoverished hermit kingdom in oil in exchange for its nuclear expertise.Despite the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Trump has withdrawn the US from, Iran has continued to develop nuclear-capable missiles, claims Jafarzadeh.He added: “These missiles are not being developed for defensive purposes.“One of the main goals is the missile programme is to develop nuclear-capable missiles that are able to carry nuclear warheads with a range of over 2000km.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404722026.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ants home invasion what to do","story":"Heres all the information you need to know.Ants love your home, especially your kitchen as it is one huge source of food for the pesky insects.An scout ant will leave the nest in search of food, leaving a trail of pheromones.Once it finds food it will follow the trail back, leaving even more pheromones, which then other ants will follow as they go out for food.Soon enough youll have a whole army running all over the place in search of everything from grains of sugar to dirty dishes.Store all food away, ideally in airtight containers, if possible.Dont leave food outClean up any food and drink spills as soon as possible.Clean thoroughly, including cupboards.Wash pet bowls regularly - ants are also partial to cat and dog food too.Take out your rubbish regularly.Clean your entire kitchen with a natural, homemade anti-ant spray, made with one part water, one part vinegar - this destroys their pheromones.Hopefully this will mean the ants move elsewhere in their search for food.Use various ant deterrents such as salt, chalk, curry powder, pepper and cinnamon and line doors and windows with any of these - but these might not be ideal if you have pets and/or small children.If you can follow the ants back to their nest find out how they are getting in and block up any holes with sealant, especially around doors and windows.Perhaps as a last resort, if you know where the nest is, open it up with a knife and then pour a kettle full of boiling water down it.A bit drastic but this will kill all the ants, including the queen. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They can uphold 350 years of press freedom or stop newspapers from holding the rich, the powerful and the corrupt to account. In Britain we believe in decency and fairness. We want those who rig the system, whether it is MPs fiddling their expenses or slum landlords ripping off tenants, to be held responsible. And the main champion of the underdog in our open and democratic society is the Press. Yet the freedoms the Press enjoy – and with it the ability to expose wrongdoing – are under threat.  In the latest World Press Freedom Index, the UK was ranked 40th in the world behind countries such as Jamaica and Chile. And if two Labour MPs have their way today, those freedoms could be further eroded. Tom Watson and Ed Miliband have hijacked the Data Protection Bill by tabling amendments which could have serious consequences for investigative journalism, the viability of local papers and the openness of our democracy. What will the Tom Watson amendment do? The Shadow Culture Secretary is trying to resurrect a modified form of Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Court Act. This proposes that unless papers sign up to the state-recognised regulator IMPRESS, they will have to pay the legal costs of both sides in data protection cases, even if they win. The amendment exempts not-for-profit publishers such as the  and the Observer and titles in specific regions with a turnover below \u0026pound100million. But it would still cover 85% of local papers as most are owned by media companies, such as the Mirror’s publisher Reach, with turnovers above that amount. Watson is a friend of former Formula One boss Sir Max Mosley, who has harboured a deep loathing for newspapers since the News of the World revealed he took part in an S\u0026ampM party with prostitutes. He bankrolls IMPRESS through an arms-length charity and also gave Watson a \u0026pound500,000 donation to fund office costs and staff – money Watson has declined to give back despite the revelation Mosley published a campaign leaflet in the 1960s which linked non-white immigrants to diseases such as VD and leprosy.  Why should it be resisted? Local newspaper editors and freedom of speech campaigners say the amendment will cause irreparable damage to journalism. Editors will not be able to risk running stories exposing corruption or wrongdoing if they know it will result in expensive legal action. Jodie Ginsberg of Index on Censorship said it could be used by people to avoid exposure, even in cases such as the Windrush scandal where exposure is in the public interest. The main beneficiaries of Watson’s amendment would be those who want to wipe their grubby reputations clean by removing stories from the internet. This could include paedophiles with historical convictions or shady businessmen who want to start up their next dodgy venture. These are the sort of people who would threaten us with a data protection claim, knowing we would have to pay all the costs of the case unless we removed the articles about them from our websites, preventing you from seeing the truth. Mosley recently threatened the Mirror with a Data Protection Act claim concerning revelations about him that were heard in open court and are still available online. We are defending it vigorously. However, if the Watson amendment goes through, Mosley would get all the costs of his claim even if he lost, unless we were to join IMPRESS, the regulator HE helped found and finances through a trust. Media lawyer Antony White says the Watson amendment could also be illegal.  Who regulates the press? In the wake of the phone hacking scandal, the British press has changed the way it operates. Following the recommendation of Sir Brian Leveson’s inquiry, the majority of the country’s papers set up an independent regulator called IPSO. More than 2,600 print and online titles are now covered by IPSO which has the power to impose fines of up to \u0026pound1million and demand front page apologies for serious breaches. An independent review of IPSO by Sir Joseph Pilling found it to be independent, effective and compliant with most of Leveson’s recommendations. What is wrong with IMPRESS? No title of any significance has signed up to IMPRESS – and there are not just concerns about the motives of Mosley. It is governed by a Royal Charter, which in turn is overseen by politicians on the Privy Council. Any organisation that accepts it as its regulator also agrees, by extension, to state control. While the present regime may not interfere through the Privy Council, a future regime could use it to exert control over the press.

Managing Director Colin Paynter said work on Galileo, currently run out of Portsmouth, will move to France and Germany “on day one” if the firm wins a new \u0026pound175m contract. He said Brussels made a condition that the work, on ground control operations, “has to be led by an EU-based company by March 2019.” He told MPs on the Brexit Committee: “We have committed to, should we win that bid, we will do all the work in the EU27 at our sites in France in Germany.  Britain could launch its own satellite GPS system if the EU bans it from the Galileo programme after Brexit  “That has made us slightly less competitive because we’re moving away from where the heritage and skill is, which is in the UK.” “And I think a number of companies are in the process of moving that work so they comply with conditions of the tenders.” Airbus put in its bid last month.  It is the latest twist in a Brexit row over Brussels’ \u0026pound9bn satellite navigation network. Brussels has reportedly threatened to cut UK ties with Galileo, an EU rival to the US-controlled GPS network, on security grounds. In turn UK sources are threatening to block Galileo from using UK overseas territories, block UK firms from passing sensitive information to the EU - or even set up a \u0026pound3bn rival UK system. A top military chief branded the EU’s threats “odd”. Air Marshal Edward Stringer, RAF Director General Joint Force Development, told the Policy Exchange think tank: “European defence is a nicety - the defence of Europe is a necessity. “When you consider how much we share with our European allies it does seem odd that security questions are raised over something like Galileo. I’m sure those are not insurmountable.”  Top Lockheed Martin executive Patrick Wood added the row was “a small glitch along the way”.

And he made a very good fist of it.  Given Labour’s own difficulties on the issue as illustrated by last night’s rebellion in the Lords you could understand why Corbyn might have wished to avoid the subject.  Clearly the Cabinet’s disarray was too tempting to ignore for the Labour leader. Corbyn’s questions were uncharacteristically sharp and direct. Does the Prime Minister agree with the Foreign Secretary that her plans for a customs partnership were crazy? was his opening gambit.  Theresa May immediately relapsed into her dismal speak-your-weight machine mode. We are, she said, leaving the European Union and leaving the customs union. As with all her subsequent answers these words were delivered with a weight and importance that belied the triteness and inadequacy of their content. Perhaps she surmised that if she feigned the role of Prime Minister nobody would realise she was a malfunctioning hologram bereft of any answers. Corbyn briefly acknowledged her non response before moving on to the the wider Cabinet confusion. He noted the differing views between the Business Secretary and the Foreign Secretary on the proposed customs arrangements. He pointed out that neither of the Cabinet’s preferred options were workable. And he noted that after 23 months the Government had failed to come up with a solution. When, he asked, would the Government bring forward the trade bill and the customs bill?  The Prime Minister did not such much duck the question as run to the other side of the country, hide under a blanket and put her fingers in her ears before muttering “can’t hear you, can’t hear you.” We are working for the best deal, was the best response she could muster. Which you suppose is reassuring when the alternative would be a government knowingly working for the worst deal. Mrs May ended with a feeble attack on Labour’s performance in the local elections. Six times she was asked a direct question by the Labour leader and six times she failed to give a straight answer. Who knew that Brexit could prove such fertile ground for a Labour leader generally regarded as ambivalent on the subject?

Kaylene Vymola, 21, wanted to get in shape in time for a dream holiday to Mexico, so she\u0027d feel confident in a bikini on the beach. Though the instructional technology rep cut out unhealthy food she says she didn\u0027t hit the gym once - and instead opted to start walking everywhere. Kaylene would trek on her lunch breaks and go for hour-long strolls around her neighborhood each night. By the time she and boyfriend Alex Lo Monaco flew to Playa Del Carmen six months later she had dropped an impressive 40lbs, losing another 20lbs when she returned. Kalyene says she felt good in her bikini and to top it all off, romantic Alex, a customer service rep, got down on one knee while they were away and asked her to marry him.  Now the beautiful bride-to-be said she feels happier and more confident and has revealed her simple secret to success. Kaylene, of Niantic, Connecticut, said: It was just walking. I never stepped foot in a gym, I just walked and walked and walked and walked.I would walk about 15,000 steps a day - six miles. I would always walk during my lunch breaks. It was either sitting at my desk or sitting in a cafe, or going outside and going for walk. Every day after work I would go for an hour long walk through my neighborhood.Honestly I didn\u0027t feel that I needed to go to the gym. I didn\u0027t want to spend the money on it. I had a lot of people come up to me and ask me, \u0027How did you do it?\u0027 I had a lot of family members who said, \u0027You look great. \u0027I feel a lot better now. I feel much more confident, not only in my looks but in my personality. I feel like I can talk to more people. I definitely have more energy as well. I could go all night walking around my neighborhood now.  Kaylene decided to make a change in July 2017 in time for her vacation that December, firstly by cutting out some of the junk she was eating. She stuck to her favorite breakfast of eggs but switched chips and sandwiches from Subway for grilled chicken and salads at lunch. For dinner, she ditched carb-heavy pizza and pasta in favor of protein-based meals and she completely cut out her guilty pleasure - chocolate. Instead of munching on Kit Kats and Reese\u0027s she opted for healthy snacks and she swapped coffee for tea, always ensuring she was in a calorie deficit for the day. Kaylene also took up her walking regime and by the she stepped on the plane to Mexico she had lost 40lbs. She went on to lose a further 20lbs after returning home.  I have always kind of been on the overweight side and I was self conscious, she said. Through my teens, being in school and comparing yourself to other skinny little girls who get all the attention from the guys - it was very frustrating. I wasn\u0027t extremely down about it but it always kind of bothered me. I felt unhappy. In summer you want to wear bikinis and dresses and I was very hesitant because I didn\u0027t feel great in them. We have four beaches in the town I live in and my friends would always go, but I would avoid it. I wasn\u0027t worried about comments, it was more that I didn\u0027t want to be around a bunch of really good looking people and I felt I didn\u0027t look good. My goal was to feel confident in a bikini. I just wanted to feel better and more confident and not worry about people staring. It was torture in the beginning but Mexico was keeping me going because I had it booked.

Laura Jackson, 32, says becoming a single parent had a dramatic financial impact leaving her living on \u0026pound2,000 less every month. Instead of spending money on healthy meals for herself, she made sure her children ate good food and she would sit alone in the house and snack on pizza and chips, chocolate and 50p biscuit packs.  Cooking a healthy meal for one is expensive and I wanted to save my money to make sure the children had enough, she told Mirror. I always fed them good quality food but biscuits, chips and pizza are so much cheaper than a chicken breast so that\u0027s what I would eat. And I\u0027ve always loved chocolate!  Laura would also make \u0027bad choices\u0027, eating too many takeaways and meals out in restaurants. I was going out loads and enjoying life too much, Laura said. I was a single mum and I gorged if I had a good day and I gorged if I had a bad day. I ate to console myself when things went wrong and to reward myself as a treat.  However, it wasn\u0027t long before Laura, then 28, piled on more than 6st and went from a size 14 to a size 22. One day while out shopping with friends she realised that she had gained so much weight that shops did not stock clothes big enough to fit her.  Determined to lose weight she started a meal replacement programme and a high protein diet but she still craved cake and found that many supermarkets did not stock any healthy alternatives to her liking. So Laura went home and started experimenting in the kitchen, baking healthy, protein-based snacks for her and her family and in doing so, she stumbled on a major gap in the market. Since starting The Protein Bakery in August last year, Laura has piled on the pounds again by building a multi-million pound business in just eight months creating \u0027healthy\u0027 guilt-free cakes. Her business has a projected turnover of almost \u0026pound3m for the first year and she has secured deals with two national supermarket chains. She counts Strictly Come Dancing and Emmerdale star Gemma Atkinson, a host of sporting professionals and The Real Housewives Of Cheshire among The Protein Bakery\u0027s celebrity fans.  Laura believes her determination was key to making it a success. People said \u0027you can\u0027t do it, you have no experience, you won\u0027t get retailers to listen to you.\u0027 But I was determined. I wanted a better life for my kids and I believed there was a gap in the market, she said. Her children, William, 10, Gabriella, 9, Elodie, 5, and Mila, 2, were her chief product testers and once they loved her cakes and could not tell that they were \u0027healthy\u0027, she knew she was onto a winner. I invested my own money in it. I Googled about business and recipes all night. I went into sales meetings and had to look up what business terminology meant on my phone to learn that language. I sent samples to celebrities like Gemma Atkinson, Christine McGuiness and Duncan from Blue with a handwritten note asking them to mention the product on their social media accounts if they liked them. Usually you have to pay for endorsement but I could not afford that. They were so kind and it really worked. After Gemma Atkinson shared my product on Instagram I got 700 new followers almost instantly. I think my story also inspires a lot of people. I was a single mum, struggling with my weight who became a business entrepreneur creating healthy snacks. I was scared at first to put myself out there but I realised that if you want people to buy your product they need to know who you are. Sharing my personal story really helped me build the business.  Her experience as a cash-strapped single mum also inspired her to keep the cost down. Her protein snacks will sell as three bars for \u0026pound2 as opposed to \u0026pound2.49 for one. I used to feel guilty as a single mum that I could not afford to buy healthier snacks for my kids. I want everyone to be able to afford these. I select my ingredients carefully and really think about how to produce them cost-effectively. I\u0027m also careful not to be greedy. I would rather work on lower profit margins so the products can be accessible to everyone. As a former dieter, she was inspired to create a high-protein product sold on the baked goods aisle instead of being hidden away on the healthy foods shelf - a first Laura claims for that product category. I want my products to be accessible to everyone so that someone like me can walk by and buy a guilt-free treat. A high-protein diet is beneficial to many people, not just body-builders or gym fanatics. They\u0027re made with healthy, everyday ingredients and you can make them at home so they belong on that aisle. Before her baking revolution she had a beautician business in her home town of Congleton, Cheshire, which employed three people but did not have enough to pay for extras like holidays. And in just eight months, what she hoped would be a \u0027pocket-money\u0027 business with an aim of turning over \u0026pound600 a month to save for a a family holiday, quickly became a booming business with a multi-million pound projected turnover.  She just signed a major deal with Asda which will stock her products in 350 stores nationwide from May 17 and in September she will launch with other major retailers. Laura said: I burst into tears when I was told about the deal. I had to really cut back on the kids to pay for packaging and ingredients for the business so to have that financial pressure lifted was incredible. It was like light suddenly dawning at the end of the tunnel. Suddenly I knew I could pay for simple things like my kids\u0027 school trips next month. Laura has an exclusive deal with a bakery to produce her recipes under her guidance and she will employ administrative staff this summer. I need to manage the business but keep time for my kids, I started it for them so if it takes my time away from them the whole thing loses its point, she added. A cookbook is also in the pipeline, followed by baking sets designed to make healthy baking affordable and easy and a cookware and utensils range. While she was on her weight loss journey, which began with meal replacement and a high-protein diet, she met her now husband Dylan in a bar in their local town. The couple welcomed their first child, Mila, into the world in January 2016 and married last year. Laura explained: I was a size 18 at the time and a single mum but he loved me for who I was. He helped me through the dark days when I just wanted to give up. He\u0027s been hugely supportive. Fake it \u0027till you make it: Have confidence in yourself. You can learn something really quickly if you put the effort in and it may surprise you just how much you can achieve. Networking is key: I had no contacts before I started using LinkedIn. Use networking events. By the end of the event you will have helped other people and found solutions for issues of your own. Use social media: LinkedIn was a vital tool for me to make contact with suppliers and retailers. Instagram was a great tool to promote my brand and the business. Goals: Identify what motivates you, focus on what you want to achieve and make small, achievable goals. Keep a clear budget: Costs can quickly spiral and cash-flow issues can arise quickly when you have to pay suppliers before payment comes from sales. Be realistic and very strict with your budget. Use Google and teach yourself: I used to spend all night researching the business online. Initially I did not understand what people said in meetings. Now I walk in and I understand it all. Have a story: Build your personal story and motivation into the identity of your business. A genuine personal story and sharing yourself with your audience helps them relate more to your product."},{"url":null,"title":"couple who weigh 55 stone","story":"NewsCouple who weigh 55 stone \u0027banned\u0027 from taxis after car suspension broke\u0027Marcus Edwards and Taylor Faulkner, from Hodge Hill in Birmingham, used to use Centrex Cars up to four times a day\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter11:38, 9 MAY 2018Updated11:42, 9 MAY 2018NewsMarcus Edwards weighs 36 stone and claims he has been banned from using Centrex Cars\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A couple who weight a combined 55 stone claim they have been banned from taxis because the 36-stone boyfriend broke the suspension of two different cabs.  Marcus Edwards and Taylor Faulkner, from Hodge Hill in Birmingham, used to use Centrex Cars as many as four times a day for rides to and from Edwards\u0027 mother\u0027s home a mile away from where the couple live.  But on Tuesday the overweight pair were attempting to book a cab and they claim they were told they had been banned because the 29-year-old had damaged two cabs due to his weight.  Faulkner, 26, who weighs 19 stone, and Edwards claim they are being discriminated against because of their size. Centrex Cars have denied they are banned and a spokesperson said they do not have vehicles big enough for Edwards.  Edwards is registered obese, has cellulitis in his legs, body fluid problems, and has blood clots in his lungs and heart.  He is appalled by the company\u0027s decision, as he has been a loyal customer\u0027 for the past five years and spends up to \u0026pound20 a day on the rides, he told the Sun .  He even books a five seater van when taking rides so they can fit his girth. Edwards told The Sun: I am obese because of my medical problems but this is discrimination against larger people like me, pure and simple. I don\u0027t believe I have knackered two cars\u0027 suspensions but I think they just don\u0027t want a person of my size around them. They should realise I suffer from a disease called obesity. After all the money we have spent with them they should be ashamed.

Mike Savage entrusted his 4x4 to Meet and Greet Manchester Airport Parking before jetting off on holiday to Majorca on Friday, April 13 with his wife. But on the day they were due to fly back to Manchester, he received a text from the firm informing him his car had been involved in crash. Bosses at the meet and greet firm, which is not affiliated with Manchester Airports Group, confirmed the car had been involved in a crash with two buses on the M60 on Friday, April 13. Mr Savage, from Glossop, believes his vehicle must have been driven at speed to have ended up so badly damaged.  The firm denies this is the case. Retired Mr Savage said: “We got back to their compound in Stockport and there it was, all smashed up. “I know accidents happen but you don’t expect to come back and find your car smashed to smithereens. “It was badly damaged at the front and the back. That can only have happened if it was being driven at speed. “There’s been so much confusion about what actually happened.

A poll of 2,000 parents of children up to age 10, also found 41 per cent have abandoned attempting to get greens into kids’ diets because they are more concerned about ensuring they eat full stop. Twenty-nine per cent have lost their patience trying to get their youngsters to eat a healthy diet, with one in five saying they have given up because they were tired or in a rush. And shockingly, five per cent confessed they simply don’t think it’s important for their children to get their five-a-day. The research was commissioned by home appliance manufacturer Beko to celebrate the launch of its new ‘Eat Like A Pro’ campaign in partnership with FC Barcelona, which aims to help parents inspire their kids to eat a little bit healthier and tackle a global issue of childhood obesity.  Donald Shepherd, Marketing Director Beko UK said: “Our research shows that the battle to achieve a balanced diet continues and it’s as challenging as ever for some mums and dads to get fruit and vegetables into their little ones. “It’s been widely reported that in the UK, 25% of 2-10-year olds and one third of 10-15-year olds are overweight or obese*. “One of the challenges that has come out of this new research, is that 27 per cent of parents say that they need more exciting recipes that include fruit and vegetables, to help them achieve getting their kids to eat five-a-day. “With that in mind, through Eat Like A Pro we’re working with FC Barcelona’s nutritionist to create over 100 recipes that are simple but nutritious for all the family to enjoy.” In addition, three quarters of parents surveyed admitted they struggled to feed their youngsters fruit and vegetables, with one in 10 stating fresh food goes off before they have a chance to eat it. And 28 per cent of children avoid their veggies because they simply don’t like the taste.  Ironically, it would seem the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree with parents getting just three portions of fruit and veg daily themselves. As a result, six in 10 have resorted to ‘tricking’ their children into eating their veggies such as hiding them in other foods or bribing them. It’s fair to say parents are giving it their best shot, with 85 per cent explaining the value of a healthy diet to their little ones, but just half think their wise words actually have an impact. One in five said their kids’ friends have the most influence on their choice of foods, with an equal number in agreement their school plays the biggest part. Mums and dads admitted to first ‘giving up’ on getting greens in their kids at the tender age of four, but nearly one third confessed to exaggerating their veggie feeding endeavours to keep up appearances. Seven in 10 parents have confessed to battling with their youngsters to try and get them to eat their greens when they don’t want to.

Flat Earth truther Gerrard Gallacher has been rejected by a number of the main national bookies because his request is invalid. The Grimsby man firmly believes it\u0027s a bet he would win - and says it would cost bookies millions of pounds.  Gerrard, who doesn\u0027t believe manned rockets have been sent into space, told the Grimsby  that the bookmakers know I am right and they should at least accept his wager.   He first began thinking that the Earth was flat a few years ago after becoming curious about the subject. Since then he has done his own research and is now even more convinced that Earth isn\u0027t round. Gerrard, who has tried to bet up to \u0026pound100, said: I think the reason that they won\u0027t accept my bet is because they know that I am right in saying that the Earth is flat, and if other people joined me in placing the bet they could lose millions. But then even if I am proven wrong and the world is round, then why would they not take my bet? It is just easy money for them.  William Hill are known for taking on crazy bets, I could go in now and bet my son will play for Celtic and score a hat-trick in 20 years, and they have even accepted one saying Elvis will come back from the dead, so why not that the Earth flat? I have tried everyone - Paddy Power, Bet 365, William Hill and Coral - but none of them are interested. I thought I had made some progress with SkyBet as they were open about it when I spoke with them, but yet again they came back to me and said they wouldn\u0027t do it. One of the main reasons he believes Earth is flat is the conspiracy theory that there are no real photos of the planet from space, and the existing images were generated by a Nasa computer.  Gerrard said: I just don\u0027t believe that we have ever sent rockets into space. I cannot comprehend that if space is a vacuum where there is no air, then what do the rockets propel against? I have also viewed footage of amateur weather balloons that clearly show to me that the Earth is flat, as I cannot see a curvature anywhere. Another reason that has convinced me is that apparently water is always meant to fall at a level and does not bend. So then how does the Earth manage to bend water all the way around a globe, it just doesn\u0027t seem to add up.

In her first full interview, for which she was not paid, she told the Mirror that she is not evil and insists she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Shannon was found sedated at the home of Michael Donovan, uncle of Matthews’ boyfriend Craig Meehan, after a search lasting 24 days. Matthews and Donovan were found guilty at Leeds Crown Court of \u0026shykidnapping, false imprisonment, and perverting justice. Both were given eight-year prison sentences. Last year, the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside about Shannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Karen Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. Here is what has happened to the people involved in the real life drama on the Moorside estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire in 2008.  Shannon was taken into care after the trial, and now lives with a new family. She is 19 years old now and was given a new identity which cannot be revealed. Karen Matthews Shannon\u0027s mum Karen was released from jail in 2012 after serving half of her eight-year sentence. The 43-year-old, who has a new identity, was relocated away from her home in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. She has dramatically changed her appearance as the Mirror\u0027s exclusive pictures show.  Julie Bushby Played by Sheridan Smith in the series, Julie led the search for Shannon after her \u0027disappearance\u0027. She still lives in Dewsbury and has admitted she feels sorry for Karen Matthews after the ordeal. She visited her friend in prison monthly for four years in an attempt to discover the truth about what happened - but stopped when she didn\u0027t get answers.  “I just wanted the truth,” said Julie. “She kept saying other people were involved, I wanted the truth, to know who, why, what.” After Karen was released from prison, her contact with Julie stopped as the terms of her release meant she was unable to communicate with her.  Natalie Murray was another of Karen\u0027s friends who helped her in the search for Shannon. She is now a stay-at-home mum and left Dewsbury in 2009. Appearing on TV ahead of the drama\u0027s airing, she revealed she will never be able to forgive Karen. “It started when she did the very first interview outside her house,” recalled Natalie.  “I was there when the family liaison officer told her not to do the interview or speak to the press until they had as much information as they could get, and then they’d deal with that side of the press. It was due to previous cases when a child has gone missing and it could put their life at risk. But Karen did the interview. To me, as a mum, why would you do that when you’ve been told it could put a child’s life at risk?” Natalie said she “went straight down and asked her” why she did it, and claimed Karen’s answer was “everybody told me” to do it. “[I felt] angry that nobody listened to me or saw what I was seeing about her behaviour or things like that,” added Natalie.  Craig Meehan was Karen\u0027s boyfriend at the time - and his uncle Michael Donovan was found to have planned Shannon\u0027s disappearance to generate money from the publicity and search. Although he wasn\u0027t involved in the kidnapping, he was convicted of possession of child pornography after police examined computers at the home.  He was sentenced to 20 weeks imprisonment, but was released on the same day as he had spent longer on remand than the length of the sentence. The ex-fishmonger, now 30 and with a new name, had no part in the fake abduction. Michael Donovan  Michael was found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice for his role in the stunt. Along with Karen, he was sentenced to eight years in prison - and by the time she was released after serving half the sentence, Donovan had already been released. The Sunday Mirror published a new picture of Donovan snapped outside a coffee shop watching children playing nearby from 2012.

At a first glance, Carole Middleton and Doria Ragland appear to be polar opposites.  One is a yoga-loving, free-spirited social worker. The other is an uber-coiffed home counties matriarch and self-made millionaire.  Come May 19 , however, Doria joins the strange club that Carole has inhabited for the last seven years - an in-law to the royals.   This weird world they\u0027ll be thrown into - with it\u0027s unforgiving spotlight - might not be the only thing they have in common though.  1. Closeness to their daughters  The first time we ever heard the then-Kate Middleton speak was during her engagement interview, when she painted an image of a close-knit family and a happy upbringing. Fast-forward nearly eight years, and it\u0027s clear the Middletons are as tight as ever. In those early weeks after Prince George\u0027s birth, Kate and William relocated to Carole and Michael\u0027s house in Berkshire. Set on 18 acres of land, it provided a haven for the new family.  Carole is believed to be a hands-on granny with her grandchildren too. It\u0027s believed she\u0027s stepped in to give her daughter a helping hand now she\u0027s a mum-of-three , and is frequently seen at royal events - at the invitation of the Queen no less.  Despite geography keeping them apart, Doria and Meghan are no less close.           After divorcing Meghan\u0027s dad, Thomas Markle, when Meghan was six, Doria had Meghan live with her (although the Suits actor did see her dad regularly). On her now-defunct blog, The Tig, Meghan rather sweetly revealed her mum\u0027s pet name for her was Flower and has written about her several times.  In a post called Love Letter, she wrote: Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. And if the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic \u0027Call Me,\u0027 just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance you\u0027ve ever seen, swaying her head and snapping her fingers to the beat like she’s been dancing since the womb. And you will smile. You won\u0027t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy. I\u0027m talking about my mom. It appears Harry is a fan of Doria\u0027s too, in the BBC interview following their engagement he enthused: Her mum’s amazing!  2. Work Much is made of Carole and Michael Middleton\u0027s success, but before Party Pieces elevated them into the category of the super-wealthy, Carole worked as a flight attendant.  As, apparently, did Doria in the years after her divorce from Meghan\u0027s dad, the Mail Online reports.  Since the Middleton\u0027s launched Party Pieces in 1987, the company is now believed to be valued at \u0026pound30 million.  Doria\u0027s long career is as social worker is no less impressive. The yoga fanatic is nicely tucked away from all the crazy circus of the royal wedding, and still works Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services in Culver City, California. 3. Marriage Carole and Michale Middleton married in 1980 and have presented a pretty solid front ever since. They\u0027re never not smiley and seen to be loving life. Doria and lighting-director Thomas married in 1979 in a wedding that is a far cry from the pomp and ceremony their own daughter will experience.   The bride wore flowers in her hair and the whole day had a New Age feel about, taking place at the Self-Realisation Fellowship Temple on Sunset Boulevard.   Sadly they divorced eight years later, but it\u0027s believed the split was amicable, and they will be presenting a united front at their daughter\u0027s wedding.  They both issued a joint statement following the news of Meghan and Harry\u0027s engagement, which read: We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry.  Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. We wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together. 4. Style and health Of the two women, Carole is the undisputed queen of splashing the cash on looking good. She\u0027s been known to frequent Richard Ward’s salon in Chelsea, where a Cleanse, Condition, Cut and Finish can set you back \u0026pound225.  According to the Mail, Carole is also partial to facial courtesy of celebrity facialist Linda Meredith, whose anti-ageing treatments cost around \u0026pound150.  That said, Doria\u0027s no slob when it comes to skincare.  When I was 13 years old, my mum had me start getting facials, Meghan has said. It seemed so silly at the time, trekking in my school uniform to see a woman named Anika who slathered my skin with Yon-Ka products and chatted away about the importance of eye cream.

But the 43-year-old has spoken out in a bid to convince the nation she is not evil and insist she knew nothing of the snatch plot that shocked the nation. Matthews even offered to take a lie detector test about what happened to her daughter when she vanished in February 2008 before being found at an accomplice’s flat tethered to a bed. And without any hint of remorse over the sick kidnap, she pointed to other vile criminals to justify her claim that she should not be branded evil.  Mum-of-seven Matthews said: “I’m not Britain’s worst mum. I didn’t kill anybody. “Baby P’s mum and Maxine Carr don’t get the abuse that I do. “None of it’s true. I’m on the edge. It makes me want to kill myself but I’d never do that. I’m scared I’ll die lonely and alone.” Despite being found guilty of snatching Shannon when the youngster was nine and serving four years of an eight year sentence, Matthews still refuses to accept she took any part in the plot to cash in on \u0026pound50,000 reward money. She said she was made a “scapegoat” and added: “From the start I didn’t know where she was. Others were involved. I didn’t have a clue. “You can’t kidnap your own child. I know the truth and I wasn’t involved in it. I still have nightmares thinking that it’s all going to happen again.  “I want to take a lie detector test to prove my innocence.” But she says she fears she won’t be forgiven.  Shannon was kidnapped from near her home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorks. Her disappearance sparked a massive month-long police search. Matthews and her then boyfriend Craig Meehan joined the hunt and she made several public appeals for help to find her daughter. Shannon was found on March 14 at Michael Donovan’s flat in nearby Batley Carr. She had been drugged. Donovan was also found guilty of kidnap, sentenced to eight years and released after four. But he was recalled to prison in 2012 after a bust-up in Leeds. Born-again \u0026shyChristian Matthews spoke about her time behind bars. She said: “When I was first in jail I thought I was going to die. I panicked.  “They were banging on my cell door saying, ‘Come out here, you dirty nonce.’ Prison made me weaker. I don’t feel like the same person any more. I was beaten up inside because of who I was. “Once they threw a snowball with a rock in it at me and other times I was punched. I didn’t say anything, I was too scared.” But Matthews insisted she did make friends, including a transgender prisoner in Peterborough’s segregation unit. And she claimed she had admirers on the outside. She said: “Men used to write to me with semi-naked pictures and ask if I fancied meeting up because everyone makes mistakes.” Matthews also used our interview to deny claims she has a 72-year-old “sugar daddy”, Eric Anderson.  She said: “I have standards. I’m very lonely and I found a friend who I thought I could trust. A true friend. “He was just somebody to talk to because I’ve got nobody else. Somebody has blown our relationship out of context. He did give me money because he wanted to help me. “He got the money from some inheritance and said he wanted to help me out because I’m struggling. “He’s like a father figure to me, like an uncle. There’s no sex involved. I’ve known him for years. Eric takes me for coffee and KFC and tells me not to go with the nasty men I have met and not to be taken advantage of. I’ve sworn off men. I will never get married. I don’t trust them at all. “I’m trying to get my life back on track and everything that is being said is not true.”  Matthews also denied claims she was selling sandwiches to the \u0026shyhomeless that had been handed out free by Pret a Manger shops. She said: “I never sold them I gave them to the homeless. “This woman that’s a church person was handing them out. “It was getting dark earlier and I used to go to help pick them up and take them to the homeless around the station. Sometimes I’d take them to the \u0026shySalvation Army. It makes me sick what was said, that’s not me. I was doing it out of the goodness of my heart.”  Matthews was relocated to a town in the south of England for her own safety after being released from prison. She said she spends her days walking from charity shop to charity shop, trawling for bargains. But she also works as a volunteer in a \u0026shyChristian charity shop. She added: “I am really proud of getting a job. It makes me feel like I’ve achieved \u0026shysomething for myself. “I feel I’m not being judged when I’m there. I love my job and I love going in every time. They say I’m a good worker, one of their best and I could get a paid job in the future.”  But Matthews revealed she has now stopped going to church. She said: “People found out who I was and I was getting grief there, people saying, ‘Oh, do you know who that is?’ “I felt uncomfortable and there were kids there as well. I still believe in God, I just don’t go to church now.” Matthews lives in a one-bedroom basement flat with her budgie Bob. She said she is still “terribly lonely” and added: “I talk to Bob when I get home. I feed him from my hand. “I don’t want a man. I don’t trust them. It’s just me and the budgie now.” Because of her time behind bars Matthews said she is uncomfortable indoors. She added: “I hate being trapped. I have to get out.”  When she goes out she puts a head band on to cover up her roots as her natural ginger hair starts to appear. She isn’t very well – doctors said she has gallstones – and she is on pills to ease the pain as she awaits surgery. Matthews said: “It scared me. I’ve lost six stone since because it was down to fatty foods. I used to eat lots of sweets but now I try to eat better.” Last year the BBC screened a drama, The Moorside, about \u0026shyShannon’s kidnap. Gemma Whelan starred as Matthews, Sheridan Smith played her best pal Julie Bushby and Sian Brooke was neighbour Natalie Brown. In the past, Matthews has spoken to the Mirror about how the only thing she missed in jail was sex and \u0026shyshopping. In another interview she claimed she knew where Shannon was after she had been snatched – contradicting her own story. Karen Matthews has not been paid for this interview.

But in the last few years it\u0027s gained a new lease of life thanks to the young royals, and it now seems to be an appealing place for many of them to call home. The Cambridge gang now live in a lavish home on the site, and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be moving in next door after their wedding. At the moment the couple live in the small two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage, but they\u0027ll be upgraded to Apartment 1 after their wedding. It\u0027s the second biggest on the site, and work is already underway to get the lavish 21-room wing all ready for them.  But the Cambridges won\u0027t be their only royal neighbours, as Kensington Palace is full of members of the royal family - 15 to be exact. So let\u0027s take a look at all Harry and Meghan\u0027s neighbours.  The Cambridges - Apartment 1A Wills, Kate, George, Charlotte, baby Louis and Lupo the dog now live in the biggest home on the site - Apartment 1A.  It boasts six-bedrooms and was once home to Princess Margaret. After their wedding Kate and Wills spent \u0026pound4.5million doing it up. Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank - Ivy Cottage The engaged couple are the newbies in KP, having moved in just last month.  They live in Ivy Cottage, which is just around the back from Harry and Meghan\u0027s current home. Eugenie is Prince Harry\u0027s cousin, and they\u0027re said to be good pals who enjoyed partying together. The couple will marry in St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle, the same venue as Harry and Meghan, in October. The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester - Apartment 1 (for now) Prince Richard, the Queen\u0027s cousin, currently lives in Apartment 1 however he\u0027s about to be booted out to make room for Harry and Meghan.  The couple\u0027s children have now all grown up and flown the nest, so they\u0027ve agreed to move out so the new couple can have more space. But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re not being turfed out into the street. According to the Daily Mail, they\u0027re moving into the Queen\u0027s private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt\u0027s old apartment. It\u0027s a lot smaller, but apparently they don\u0027t mind... The Duke and Duchess of Kent - Wren House Prince Edward is also the Queen\u0027s cousin and he lives in an apartment with his wife Katharine.  We don\u0027t know much about their home and they\u0027ve always kept the details very private. Prince and Princess Michael of Kent - Apartment 10 Michael is another of the Queen\u0027s cousins, but their living situation caused a bit of controversy back in 2001 when it was discovered the couple were paying peanuts to live in KP.

Mandisa Mayne\u0027s strange habit began when she was still in school and saw her stealing bits of chalk from the classroom blackboard to munch on. By the time Mandisa, 36, reached secondary school her chalk-eating habit was in full throttle an saw her consuming more and more. The mum-of-two, from Birmingham, admitted her two children, and business owner husband, who she does not wish to name, find her eating habits very strange. She said: My cravings started with chalk. I used to steal it from the blackboards and nibble it during lessons as a child. The more I did it, the more I enjoyed it.  “By secondary school, I was full-on craving it and needed to eat more and more. “I used to take the chalk from the art department and eat that. Then, when I started getting pocket money, I would go to the shops and buy my own supplies.” Buying ten packets of chalk at a time from her local Wilko shop, as she got older, Mandisa struggled to control her cravings at work. She admitted: “When I became a teacher, I’d eat clay and chalk in my classroom in my breaks. Before that, working in admin, I remember one time when I was pregnant, when my work building was being refurbished and plaster was hanging off the wall, I couldn’t resist getting a screwdriver and hacking more plaster off, just so I could eat it. It was an uncontrollable craving - I just couldn’t help it.”  After she had been with her husband, who she met in 1999, through mutual friends, for two weeks, she revealed her peculiar food choices. Remembering his reaction, she said: He was shocked, but that wasn\u0027t going to stop me - nothing would. But, Mandisa\u0027s palette changed with age and, in 2011, when she discovered clay, it wiped clean her craving for chalk. She continued: I\u0027d had enough of chalk, I’d got to the point where it really wasn’t doing it for me. “All the shops I was buying it in were cheap and it didn’t taste like it used to. “I tried everywhere to find something which was as good as the old stuff, but I had no luck.” Admitting that her husband and her kids still find her clay eating habit strange, she said: I\u0027m passionate about clay. I started selling it, as I wasn\u0027t passionate about teaching anymore. I order in up to 40kg a week, keep it all around my house and then distribute it. Now I\u0027m a successful businesswoman, selling it to people just like me. “Eating clay makes me feel healthy, it’s just like a detox. I even eat it off a spoon, sometimes, like yoghurt or ice cream.”  Mandisa discovered her new favourite snack after finding an online forum, where people discussed their non-nutritious eating habits - stumbling on the condition, pica. “I’d never heard of it before, but it sounded just like me, she said. I asked if anyone had any other alternatives to chalk and someone mentioned clay. “I ordered 300g of the stuff from Georgia, USA, for \u0026pound30, and other types from Africa, Russia and the Ukraine ... and I was hooked.” Before she set up her business she was spending \u0026pound20-a-week on a 500g bag. And Mandisa, who eats it as chunks, is particularly partial to a bite after a helping of fast food, like pizza. She continued: “I’ll take it to the cinema in a little bag and eat it after my popcorn, have it on a night out, after we\u0027ve been to the chip shop, or nibble on a small amount if I have indigestion. “It’s always in my bag, wherever I go.” Mandisa has been warned by colleagues she could be damaging her body, but she remains adamant that her weird snack is good for her.

Parents and students at Mount Pleasant Primary School in Shrewsbury, where a school dinner costs \u0026pound2.20 per day, have been warned in a newsletter that arrears exceeding \u0026pound6.60 will mean the school will only be able to offer bread, fruit and water to pupils. Children falling foul of the policy are also being sat away from other pupils to eat. Mum Jamie-Lee Heath, whose daughter Madison attends the school, for four to 11-year-olds, said the rule was shocking and showed no compassion whatsoever to the children they see every day. Jamie-Lee received a text from the school just one hour before lunchtime to say \u0026pound4.40 was owed and no dinner had been ordered for Madison. She said Madison had accidentally left her lunch in her father\u0027s car the day before and was given a hot meal, leaving her owing \u0026pound2.20. Madison went to school without money or lunch the following day and despite her father agreeing to pay at the end of the day because he had no cash on him, the school text Jamie-Lee who quickly managed to pay the arrears in time.  The 30-year-old kitchen designer said: My daughter left her lunch in her dads car and was given a hot lunch instead, putting her in arrears of \u0026pound2.20. I was completely unaware of this as we share custody and she was with him that entire week. The very next day the school refused to order her a lunch and text me about an hour before lunchtime stating so. I called up immediately and explained I would pay online straight away as I didn\u0027t realise she had arrears or no dinner money but also asked about what she would have been given if I hadn\u0027t managed to read the text in time. This is when the bread, fruit and water policy was explained to me. It had been mentioned in a previous school newsletter but I must admit I hadn\u0027t read it properly. I then wrote a status on my personal Facebook page alerting other parents who may have missed the newsletter about what was happening. People caught on pretty quickly and it was shared and commented on quite a lot with most people agreeing that this was just a step too far. Not only was my child not in the arrears amount threshold, I also pay \u0026pound50 plus a week in advance for her breakfast clubs, dinners and after school clubs which the school are well aware of. To withhold a hot dinner from her over the matter of \u0026pound2.20 seemed shocking to me and many others. Myself and others also agreed that the fact the child would be taken away from their friends and given a different \u0027lunch\u0027 in a separate room seemed like a punishment to a child and could easily create upset or bullying opportunities.  To take such a sharp stance on such a small amount of money just doesn\u0027t tie in with how I imagine schools would like to be seen. No compassion whatsoever to the children they see every day. I would have been at work when the text was sent. If I had missed that text due to being in a meeting or with a customer I have no doubt that they would have followed through with the bread and water. I work 40 plus hours a week as a kitchen designer but luckily that week was my first week of maternity leave and I was off. I also find it appalling that if indeed a parent was struggling to pay lunches for whatever reason, it is the child who would suffer. Surely the first port of call is offering support and help to the parent and a point in the right direction. Not segregation of the innocent child. My issue is with the policy and how it may affect a child. To be taken away from your peers and not fed the same meal that you would normally expect. For this to happen regardless of whether the parent is a repeat offender or it\u0027s a one time genuine error as it was in this case, is just not a reasonable method. We want our children to be alert and happy at school, as we all know children learn better this way. To do this they need a full stomach. I understand repeated missed payments must be frustrating to deal with, and it\u0027s surely not the best use of school resources chasing up parents who have forgotten to pay or are struggling to pay. But they are children. It is not their fault. There surely needs to be a rethink at Mount Pleasant and indeed at any other school adhering to this policy. The school highlighted the policy in their June newsletter last year.

Now experts have worked out Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s big day could come with a hefty price tag - a cool \u0026pound32million. The average person spends \u0026pound17,913 on their day, but the royal couple\u0027s comes with a lot of extras - from bespoke silver plated fanfare trumpets to a drone destroyer. Wedding planning company Bridebook has calculated the cost based on flowers, food, entertainment and the main attraction, the dress coming in at \u0026pound1,969,873, but there\u0027s also the \u0026pound120,000 honeymoon and \u0026pound30m security costs. It\u0027s unsurprising then that the wedding, which is being held at Windsor Castle on May 19 , is expected to make the list of one of the top ten expensive weddings of all time. The main cost is down to security, as Windsor will be locked down for the day, bumping up that security bill, including snipers, undercover police and a counter-drone system - it\u0027s estimated to all cost \u0026pound30million. The bill is expected to come in higher than brother Prince William\u0027s wedding, which cost \u0026pound20m - though it was a larger affair - because of the ongoing terrorist threat level. Venue - Free  The ceremony is taking place at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle while the reception will be in St George\u0027s Great Hall, within the castle.  Marquee - \u0026pound350,000 Later the party moves to the Upper Ward grounds of Windsor. While the pair don\u0027t have to pay for the venue, they will have to fork out for that marquee.  A luxury glass marquee, similar to Pippa\u0027s cost \u0026pound300,00- plus additional catering and staff.  Catering - \u0026pound286,000 There\u0027s the formal lunch reception for state guests and the dinner reception for their family and friends. This will end up being one of the more costly parts of the wedding. Sausage rolls and hot tea for the members of the public won\u0027t come cheap either, with 2,640 of them it could come in at \u0026pound26,000! Cake - \u0026pound50,000  Harry and Meghan are opting for a banana wedding cake (we know) as well as a second cake. The unique cake will be made by pastry chef Claire Ptak , - owner of London hipster hotspot Violet Bakery. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers. Drinks - \u0026pound193,000 It\u0027s not a party, without a tipple or two! The drinks will most likely come from the Palace Cellars, but they\u0027re still worth a fair bit. If we\u0027re looking at the number of guests, they\u0027ll probably need 2,300 bottles to keep guests happy. Bridebook works out roughly 1,700 bottles of champers will be served throughout the day and 650 bottles of wine, whiskey and cocktails. A bottle of Bollinger, the family\u0027s favourite champagne, comes in at \u0026pound80 a bottle - that\u0027s \u0026pound136,000 overall. Prince Charles enjoys the 15-year-old Laphroaig Scotch and the multitude of bottles of Tignanello Wine (Meghan’s personal favourite according to her old lifestyle blog, “The Tig”) so the bill really adds up. Prince Harry\u0027s fav drink comes in a little cheaper - it\u0027s a Vodka Redbull. Dress - \u0026pound300,000 Meghan is expected to rack up quite the bill with her wedding dress , which is fair enough considering all eyes will be on her. Most of the budget will go on her first dress, which will be made just for her. There\u0027s a lot of rumours as to who will design it and what it will look like, but you can expect a clean, classic look with a modern twist. A dress like this, plus her second outfit for afterwards will come in at \u0026pound300,000 plus. She\u0027s teaming it up with a tiara .  Other sources have predicted that Meghan\u0027s dress will cost far less. Royal expert Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss and Love, told The : “Meghan is very mindful of wanting to send the right message with her gown. “It’s going to be iconic and fit the backdrop of Windsor Castle, but it would send off the wrong message to wear a dress that in cost alone would upstage Kate’s.” Kate\u0027s dress, Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, came in at \u0026pound250,000. Flowers - \u0026pound110,000  This often costs more than you expect, and with two locations it\u0027ll cost even more. Flowers for the marquee alone cost cost approximately \u0026pound70,000. The flowers in St George\u0027s Chapel and at the formal reception which follows will be provided by self-taught florist Philippa Craddock. Photos - \u0026pound17,000 Cheap hey? Dorset-based Millie Pilkington, the private wedding photographer for the William and Kate’s wedding and Pippa Middleton’s, is expected to take the pics, though Hugo Burnand should also be around for the official snaps. Stationary - \u0026pound20,000  Kensington Palace has announced Barnard and Westwood made the beautiful bespoke invitations for the Royal Wedding. A 200 piece Bespoke Stationery set from Barnard and Westwood exceeds the \u0026pound10,000 mark. The invites, with the Three-Feathered Badge of the Prince of Wales printed in gold ink, could cost a total of \u0026pound200,000 for the circa 4000 invitees, including members of the public, or \u0026pound50,000 for the VIP guests alone. Music - \u0026pound300,000  That\u0027s the bell ringers, organist, choirs....then the music for the reception too. Rumours are flying around as to who will perform - from the Spice Girls to Elton John in the running, Coldplay\u0027s Chris Martin or Meghan\u0027s mate Rihanna...but there\u0027s still the church music to pay for. Trumpets - \u0026pound90,000 Yes, trumpets. The Ministry of Defence has made a request for 20 silver-plated fanfare trumpets stamped with the Royal Coat of Arms. Made in the same workshop where Will \u0026amp Kate’s wedding and the London Olympics’ trumpets came from, each bespoke trumpet costs between \u0026pound3,000 and \u0026pound6,000. Decorations - \u0026pound130,000 The lighting for the church, marquee and furniture all rack up the cost.  Wedding rings - \u0026pound6,000 Since 1923, it has been a tradition in the Royal Family to use Welsh gold for the wedding ring of the bride. Royal warrant holder Wartski, with ties to Wales, created Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge’s ring, so could be the same choice of Meghan’s.  Prince Phillip and Prince William chose not to wear a ring, but it\u0027s thought Harry will opt to follow in his father\u0027s footsteps and wear a band. Charles\u0027 is on a ring on his little finger on his left hand, but Harry may opt for the traditional fourth finger.  While Meghan isn\u0027t opting for adult bridesmaids she is having the kids as flower girls and the boys as page boys. A page boy outfit will cost around \u0026pound226 each, and flower girl dresses \u0026pound340. Groomswear – \u0026pound8,000 As a qualified Apache Helicopter Commander, Prince Harry is likely to be wearing a tailor-made Royal Air Force uniform to his wedding. He\u0027ll need to change later too, so a tuxedo or suit also needs to be bought. Hair and Makeup – \u0026pound10,000  Belgravia’s Neville Hair \u0026amp Beauty is a favourite of Meghan’s, or she may opt for Hannah Martin of Bobbi Brown and Richard Ward, who did Kate and Pippa’s wedding makeup and hair. Church Fees – \u0026pound175 The couple have to pay their fees just like everyone else.  Security - \u0026pound30m This is the most expensive elements of the day. A hefty \u0026pound30m was spent on Kate and Wills\u0027 big day so expect more of the same. While the wedding isn\u0027t in central London, there\u0027s still a huge number of members of the public attending. With the threats made against the couple ahead of the service, security is sure to be tight - with drones, snipers and undercover cops. There\u0027s a British counter-UAV system, costing \u0026pound1m, used to deactivate intruders and sneaky drones - including pap ones! Entertainment – \u0026pound55,000 This is mostly a guest. Expect the Royal Air Force to be in there somewhere, maybe some fireworks, entertainment for all those children... it all adds up The Honeymoon \u0026pound120,000  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are reportedly heading to the exotic country of Namibia for their honeymoon . Sources have also revealed that Meghan will be the one paying for the honeymoon as gift to the Prince and that the cost will be upwards of \u0026pound100,000.

James Shaw, whose eldest daughter, Ella, reached the talent show\u0027s semi-finals in 2015, was out with his wife during the \u0027girls-only\u0027 house party. He was supposed to be out for the night with partner Janine, but could not resist logging on to their home security system using the app. He was horrified when he saw four young men at the party - which was supposed to be \u0027girls-only\u0027 - and rushed back home to break it up.  Mr Shaw, 50, arrived to find Cameron Hull, 18, kissing one of his other daughters, and the teenager was given his marching orders, a court heard.   Hull was going to leave quietly but then realised he had forgotten his brand new jacket. When he went back to get it, he found the dad barring his entry and there was another bust-up in which Mr Shaw was punched in the face. Hull, who lives around six miles away from the Shaws\u0027 home in Langho, Lancashire, admitted assaulting the dad during the incident in March. He was handed a conditional discharge for eight months by Blackburn magistrates, and ordered to pay \u0026pound100 compensation.  Last night, the labourer claimed he and his pals did not know 21-year-old singer Ella\u0027s family lived at the home, the Daily Mail reports.   He reportedly said: We got invited to a party that night by the hostess’s friend. I did not know the name of the girl I was kissing. He added: We did not know it was Ella Shaw’s family place. Mike Church-Taylor, prosecuting, had told JPs that Mr Shaw had gone out with his wife but was keeping an eye on his home via the cam app. The prosecutor said: He saw four young men in the house and decided to go home. The four males ran from the house but the defendant then tried to get back in. Mr Shaw blocked his way and was punched in the face for his trouble. Damian Pickup, defending, said his client had never been in trouble with the police before and had been invited to the party.  He was kissing the girl when her parents returned home unexpectedly, said Mr Pickup. It is clear she had been told she could have a small party but it appears they didn\u0027t expect males to be there.

Kevin Cooper taught at the St James School in Grimsby until he was suspended in July 2016 when the nature of his relationship with the pupil came to light.  At a disciplinary panel by the Teaching Regulation Agency, Cooper was banned from teaching againafter being found guilty of unacceptable professional conduct which could bring the teaching profession into disrepute, reports the Grimsby  .  Cooper\u0027s relationship with the girl was described as sexually motivated and he admitted he hoped they could start a \u0027romantic relationship\u0027 when she left school.  The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) hearing in Coventry was told that he had also contacted the girl via social media and gone with her to London. Imposing the ban on behalf of the Education Secretary, TRA decision maker, Dawn Dandy, said the ban was both proportionate and in the public interest.  She said she had taken into account that the disciplinary panel had found that Mr Cooper lacked insight or remorse in respect of what he had done. In some cases when bans are imposed on teachers a period of years is set after which they can apply to another panel to have the ban lifted. But Ms Dandy said she considered that, in order to satisfy the maintenance of public confidence in the teaching profession, there should be no review period.

The Hollywood starlet, 36, best known for her role in hit series Suits, has wowed the world while accompanying husband-to-be Prince Harry at events across the globe. And since their engagement last November, excitement about the royal wedding has rocketed with fans, royal-watchers and media around the world fascinated by every last detail. Meghan has already given up her acting career as she prepares to become an official royal, undertaking royal duties and charity work as a full-time job. But while her life has taken a dramatic aristocratic turn, the brunette-haired beauty has far more humble roots than Prince Harry.  The actress was born to Thomas Markle Snr and Doria Ragland in 1981, who divorced in 1987 - around 10 years after first meeting. Meghan has two half siblings, Samantha and Thomas Jnr, who are the children of Thomas Snr from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless. While Meghan\u0027s parents will attend the wedding together and her father will walk her down the aisle, her frosty relationship with her half-siblings mean they will not feature in her big day. Here, we\u0027ve taken a closer look at who Meghan Markle\u0027s family are. Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s age-defying yoga teacher mum  Meghan has previously gushed about her \u0027free spirit\u0027 yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland, who lives in Los Angeles and rocks dreadlocks and a nose ring. We first got a glimpse of Doria at the Invictus Games last October. After 17 months of keeping a low profile while dating, Harry and Meghan stepped out together for their first properly public display of affection - and she brought her mum too. Meghan\u0027s mum is in her early 60s, but her youthful complexion makes her look more like a sister than a mother to Markle. Born in 1956, Doria later became a social worker and yoga instructor in California, and the latter might give us a clue to her age-defying physique. She met Meghan\u0027s lighting director dad while working as an assistant make-up artist at ABC television. They married in 1979 and Meghan arrived in August 1981. The couple were to split citing irreconcilable differences when their daughter was just six. Meghan has previously revealed that her African-American mum used to be mistaken for her nanny, and that she was once called the N-word because she wasn’t pulling out of a parking space quickly enough for another driver. My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I’m half black and half white, Meghan wrote in an essay for Elle magazine. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating. While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.” Doria will be playing an important part in the royal wedding, accompanying Meghan in the bridal car on her way to the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Thomas Markle Snr, the reclusive dad who\u0027ll walk her down the aisle  Meghan\u0027s father was a workaholic who already had two children from his first marriage to Roslyn Loveless when he met Doria. According to his son Thomas Jnr, his life was to change when Meghan came along. “Before then, dad’s work took priority over everything, but she became his whole world,” he said. I remember when she came home from the hospital, he had decorated the bathroom with little angels and fairies. Like his daughter, Thomas Snr worked in entertainment, winning awards for his lighting direction. He worked on iconic America shows including Married with Children and General Hospital. The family\u0027s situation was to improve when Thomas Snr won \u0026pound560,000 on the lottery. This allowed Meghan to be privately educated, and she regularly visited the TV sets were her father worked, including Married With Children. “There I was, behind the scenes of a glossy soap opera and a TV sitcom, surrounded by famous actors and their glam teams, multi-million dollar budgets, and crew lunches that always included filet mignon and enough sweets to make you think you were at Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory, Meghan on her blog, The Tig.  Thomas Snr\u0027s split from Doria was bitter and he decided to leave LA for Mexico after declaring himself bankrupt with credit card debts of \u0026pound24,180. He now lives a reclusive existence near Rosarito Beach. There had been some debate about whether Meghan\u0027s 73-year-old dad would be lured from his retreat to walk her down the aisle. But Kensington Palace has confirmed he will be at her side on her big day. Thomas Snr will meet son-in-law to-be Prince Harry for the first time in the week before the wedding. Meghan\u0027s parents will also spend time with the Queen and Prince Philip, Prince Charles, Camilla and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  Thomas Markle Jnr shares his moniker with his father, Thomas Snr. He was 14 when Meghan was born after his father met Doria Ragland in the late 1970s. Thomas Jnr then grew up in the same household as his father, sister Samantha, step-mother Doria and half sister Meghan. Now living in Oregon, the window fitter is married to Darlene Blout and has two sons of his own. While the world will watch his father walk Meghan down the aisle on May 19, Thomas Jnr will not attend the Royal wedding. The 51-year-old has reportedly battled alcohol issues in the past and was arrested in 2017 for threatening his wife with a gun. Thomas exclusively spoke to the Daily Mirror about the frosty relationship with Meghan. He said he was left \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 by the royal wedding snub and that fame had changed the American actress. Thomas Jnr said: She’s clearly forgotten her roots. It’s torn my entire family apart. He added: Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family. She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person. He has gone so far as to write an open letter urging Harry to call of the wedding before it is too late. Thomas Jnr was a little kinder during an interview he gave just after the news of the couple\u0027s relationship emerged. It was just obvious from day one that she was destined to be somewhere really big. She\u0027s always been a princess. She\u0027s carried herself on that level from day one.” Thomas Jnr is currently estranged from his full sister Samantha, who he believes is trying to ride Meghan’s coattails. She\u0027s battered this whole Meghan thing since day one and she\u0027s obviously doing this for her little flash in the pan fame and fortune. Telling the whole world about her pushy princess sister, which is just horrible [and] not even true,” he said. Samantha Grant, the step-sister who\u0027s writing a tell-all book  Samantha Grant - born Yvonne - lives in Florida and has three children. She lived with Doria, Thomas Snr and her brother during Meghan\u0027s early years. But like her brother, she now has a difficult relationship with the bride-to-be and will not be at the wedding. Now a writer and counsellor, she is confined to a wheelchair after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2008 The 53-year-old claims she has not spoken to her half-sister for three years. All hell broke loose when she revealed plans to write a tell-all book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister. She has also accused Meghan of behavior \u0027not befitting of a Royal family member\u0027 and accused her half-sister of distancing herself after the MS diagnosis.  However, Samantha did have some positive things to say during an interview with Good Morning Britain. She\u0027s very strong she\u0027s very worldly and educated, graceful, Samantha told the show, discussing Meghan\u0027s future royal role as Harry’s wife. I think she will absolutely be a compliment to her role and I think the public will be surprised by how graceful and lovely she is. Despite the animosity, Samantha wanted a royal wedding invitation. She is not believed to have received one. Tyler Dooley, the cannabis farmer nephew  Meghan Markle\u0027s 25-year-old nephew has revealed he is a proud cannabis farmer who will reportedly make a special potent batch of the drug called Markle\u0027s Sparkle. Tyler lives in Oregon, where recreational marijuana was made legal in 2015. Reports say Tyler is proud of being part of the industry, which remains illegal in the UK. The 25-year-old, who remembered being babysat by Meghan when he was a kid, told the Daily Mail : We are passionate about marijuana and all the good things it brings. Prince Harry enjoys a good party. I’d be happy to show them around if they ever come out here and educate them on the medicinal benefits of marijuana which helps everything from post-traumatic stress syndrome to insomnia to pain in cancer patients. Tyler, the son of Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, reportedly tried his first joint at high school but says he no longer uses the drug. Since it was made legal in his state, Tyler got involved in the business and is paid a commission for sales and marketing jobs.  Frederick Markle, the \u0027recluse\u0027 bishop uncle with a \u0027congregation of one\u0027 Frederick Markle, 75, is the brother of Meghan’s dad, but their lives couldn’t be more different. While Thomas’s career too him to Hollywood, Frederick’s took him to Sanford, Florida, where he runs a ramshackle chapel and goes by the name Bishop Dismas. But despite being the leader of the Eastern Orthodox Catholic Church, he’s reportedly a recluse who can’t even work a mobile phone. “He is basically a real friendly guy but he doesn’t go for new ideas. He lives like a hermit. He’s got a cellphone but he can’t figure out how to switch it on. As for emails and computers, that’s all Greek to him,” a source said. However, while it attracted a congregation of around 40 in the eighties, these days reports claim that the only person who visits the church is the Bishop himself.

Mr Fogleman, 36, said he spoke to the employee after his girlfriend had complained about their room after arriving at the hotel with his mother and young family because of a strong smell of smoke.  The dad-of-two said he began filming the worker when he told him to leave the hotel and later shared the resulting video on his Facebook page.  In the footage, the visibly agitated worker can be seen opening a door which leads to the hotel reception before approaching Mr Fogleman and telling him please get off of my property.

As the pair squabble back-and-forth, the hotel attendant repeatedly orders Mr Fogleman to get out before uttering f****** monkey as he returns to the reception.

Little Spencer Devlin, whose dad is British, was tragically pronounced dead in hospital after plunging from the second-floor balcony last Saturday. His heartbroken family have described how he climbed through a window after his mother Holly Bishop opened it a little bit as she cleaned. The 18-month-old had reportedly been following Holly, 28, around as he always did in the moments before the tragedy in the Algarve region. After he went quiet and out of view, his mum initially thought he was getting up to mischief and searched for him, his aunt, Jess Marach, said.  But as she struggled to find him, she reportedly began to panic. She then noticed the window was “fully open” and ran over to look outside. Horrifically, she saw Spencer lying on the ground, surrounded by people. “[Holly] saw little Spencer on the ground outside with people surrounding him and she ran straight down the stairs to him,” Jess told news.au . The tot, whose breathing was laboured, was rushed to the local hospital before being transferred to Faro\u0027s Algarve University Hospital Centre. He sadly died as a result of his injuries. His mum Holly, from Perth, Australia, and dad Robert Devlin, from the UK, are said to have been left utterly devastated by his death.  The parents live in the holiday resort town of Lagos, where Robert, 32, runs a business and where the tragedy happened at the weekend. Recalling the moments leading up to Spencer\u0027s fall, Jess said Holly had opened the window a little bit to air the property and let the floors dry. “She said he was then playing in the bathroom banging around on the cupboards and she went to tell him to come out and he followed her back to the living room.  She then continued to clean the apartment and again couldn’t see Spencer or now hear him either, she told news.au. She went on to describe the horrifying moment Holly - her sister - discovered her little boy had fallen 25 feet from the balcony.  The tragedy was a freak accident, Jess told the news site, adding that Spencer, born in Portugal, was a happy and smiling youngster. A GoFundMe page has now been set up to help Holly and Robert pay funeral costs and other bills while grieving for their son. A post on the page, set up last Sunday, a day after Spencer\u0027s fall, reads: Yesterday was the worst day of rob and Holly’s life’s (sic). Yesterday morning their little baby boy Spencer had a tragic accident and was taken to faro hospital in Portugal where they did all they could for him but unfortunately he just couldn’t fight any longer and last night their beautiful baby boy Spencer grew his little wings and left all of his family behind. They are beyond devastated and would like to let everyone know but at the moment would just like some time to come to terms with their loss and be around family.

The appalling story made headlines around the globe after the children\u0027s parents were arrested.  But what happened to the family since January?  Parents Louise and David Turpin are now facing 42 charges including torture, false imprisonment and child abuse after allegedly shackling their children to a bed in California. The pair are accused of subjecting their brood to frequent beatings and even strangulation over the decades they were kept locked up in filthy conditions. The children had so little contact with the outside world, one reportedly didn\u0027t know what a police officer was. When officers discovered their filthy living conditions at their home in Perris, in January this year, they were horrified. David Turpin 57, and Louise Turpin, 49, began tying the children up as a punishment many years ago, according to prosecutors. It allegedly began with one of the boys being tied to the bed with rope, but when he escaped they started using padlocks and chains to control their children. What happened to the Turpin children?  Police discovered the Turpin children living in horrifying conditions, with three children chained to a bed in Perris, California. The horrifying scenes were uncovered in January when one of the 13 children, aged 17, escaped before making a desperate bid to inform someone of the siblings left locked up. Seven of the Turpin\u0027s 12 remaining children in captivity were adults, with all their ages ranging from two to 29. The conditions in the filthy four-bedroom Perris home were said to be dark and foul smelling and the children and young adults were malnourished and dirty after years of captivity. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said: All 13 of the victims and defendants would typically sleep all day and be up through the night. Starting many years ago, the victims would be tied up as punishment. These punishments would last for weeks or even months at a time. Police arrested both parents who are facing a total of 42 charges with a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 20. Several of the children were said to have cognitive impairment and nerve damage from extreme and prolonged physical abuse. Attorney Mike Hestrin added: None of victims were allowed to shower more than once a year. What happened to the children after their rescue?  Following their rescue, the children were taken to a police station where they were given food and drinks after they told officers they were starving. They were then taken to different hospitals for treatment and to be given to chance to wash. Police said the parents “were unable to immediately provide a logical reason why their children were restrained in that manner. After recovering in hospital, CNN reported the children are now happy living in three separate homes in Riverside County. Six of the children are minors and seven are adults.  The adults spent time in recovery at the Corona Regional Medical Centre hospital for two months.  The centre\u0027s CEO Mark Uffer spoke about the moment they left hospital, saying There were some tears flowing, both for the staff and the Turpin children, he said.  They said they loved us, they were going to miss us, they hoped to see us soon., reports CNN .  All seven adults are now living in a home together. Two of the youngest children were put into foster care, while the remaining four are at another home after authorities struggled to find accommodation for all six together. The children are reportedly regularly in touch via Skype. How were the children discovered?  The children were discovered when a 17-year-old girl plotted her escape alongside others help in captivity. Early one Sunday morning, she climbed out of a window with a one of the younger children, before the younger child became frightened and turned back. The teenager managed to alert police by that 12 of her siblings remained in captivity. She used a deactivated mobile phone to call 911. Police at the time mistook her for a child aged around 10 due to her severe malnourishment. When police arrived at the house, it was reported the Turpins desperately attempted to untie two children shackled up at the time. The parents were immediately arrested.

Now, though, we will fancy our chances going back to Tannadice.”And Fraser believes the United playing surface will give them an added advantage in the second leg.“It was a typical play-off. There’s a lot of pressure on teams in these situations and you know winning or losing can come down to small margins, so it was all a bit frantic at times.“We were trying to get our game going on a pitch that wasn’t great, so that was difficult and it suited them to put the ball in behind and run.“Tannadice should suit us better because our surface there is good and we can pass the ball. We’ll water the pitch and that will suit us when we get the ball down and try to pass it out from the back.”He’s also in no doubt knowledge gained from previous play-offs also has to give them an edge.“We do have a few boys who were in the play-offs last year with us or have played in them for other teams in the past and that helps. We know what to expect and how to handle it.“Last year at this stage we went down to Morton and got a good result, then came back to Tannadice and won well and we’ll be looking to do the same again tonight.“We’ve also got a lot of experienced boys like Scott McDonald, Bilel Mohsni and Willo Flood and they’re all a big help.”After his long injury lay-off because of well-documented problems with a broken foot, starting two games in three days will be a challenge, but he reckons he’s back to 100% fitness.“I’ve been working hard on it over the past couple of weeks and I was happy with the way I got through the 90 minutes on Tuesday.“We had the wee break last week in terms of no midweek game for a change and that meant I was able to put in some good work in training.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish football pays tribute to legendary dundee football writer ron scott","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish football has paid tribute to a respected and popular Dundee sports writer  who has died after a short illness.Ron Scott, a former chief football writer at the Sunday Post passed away in Ninewells Hospital on Sunday.

However, they are not mathematically safe from falling into the play-off spot which Partick Thistle currently occupy.The Dee host Thistle in the last game of the season and are currently six ahead with a better goal difference – meaning they are practically safe. However, Neil is not taking anything for granted.He added: “Clearly we’re safe from the automatic spot but there’s still work to be done. We’ve put ourselves in a really good position.“You can’t be too complacent, you can’t take anything for granted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win like the new dundee shirt here is how you can get it for free","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee this week unveiled their sharp new home kit for 2018/19 – and the Tele has teamed up with the Dark Blues to give a free shirt away to one lucky winner.The hooped dark blue Puma kit was launched with the help of 50 young Dees at Dens Park on Thursday ahead of the strip going on sale on Friday.An adult shirt would cost £45 for an adult or £35 for children and £37 for a full infant kit.Answer the following question correctly, though, and you’ll get yours for free.So, thinking caps on, here it is:\t\t\t"}]
