Heard filed for orce the following year, and the orce was finalized in 2017.The former spouses have both been in court during three weeks of testimony at the grand neo-Gothic court building.Ms Wass reminded Mr Justice Nicol there were \u0027well-documented episodes of violence and destruction\u0027 over Depp\u0027s adult life and that the actor had accepted he was violent to inanimate objects but not people.However, she said there was an incident earlier in his career when he assaulted a photographer with a plank of wood when under the influence of drink and drugs.She also said his evidence that he was not violent towards people was \u0027meaningless\u0027 when he was as intoxicated as he was on occasions and \u0027wouldn\u0027t have known what he was doing\u0027.Ms Wass continued: \u0027In answer to what we suggest is overwhelming evidence of domestic violence or wife-beating behaviour, catalogued over a three-year period between 2013 and 2016, Mr Depp\u0027s response is to claim that he is a victim of an elaborate hoax that has been perpetrated against him by Ms Heard and her friends.\u0027The barrister said Depp had accused Heard and her friends of \u0027having painted on injuries, manipulated photographs and destroyed property which they then went on to photograph in order to create what he describes as some sort of insurance policy for Ms Heard\u0027.Ms Wass added: \u0027What exactly Ms Heard was insuring against in the course of this hoax remains unexplained.\u0027She told the court that such a hoax \u0027would have entailed Ms Heard engaging in a pre-planned conspiracy over the period of the entire relationship with Mr Depp\u0027, adding: \u0027Such a suggestion, we say, is risible.\u0027Ms Wass told the court: \u0027The approach taken by Mr Depp from the time Ms Heard obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him on May 27 2016 was as follows: to deny that he ever assaulted Ms Heard, to accuse Ms Heard of being the violent party and to reverse his role with hers.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Oregon governor says federal agents start withdraw Portland","story":"Share this articlePortland issues ¿maximum fine¿ on feds for unpermitted fence outside courthouse bill is $192,000 ¿and counting¿ -

For it to be a successful night, remember it’s all in the planning ... Since coronavirus has shrunk our social spheres, intimate garden parties have become something of a trend. Thanks to street-wide WhatsApp chats and local volunteer groups, eclectic new friendships have been forged – and as the weather’s improved, online quizzes with distant relatives have segued into alfresco drinks with new and nearby friends.While we’re all being urged to stay alert, the easing of lockdown rules means we can meet up with more of our friends. Outside the permitted bubbles in each area, the 2-metre rule remains in place in Scotland and Wales, while iniduals in England and Northern Ireland must stay at least 1 metre apart.But groups of friends can now gather together outside – any sized group from up to two households can meet in Wales up to six people from different households in England, with no limit on people from two different households in Northern Ireland, groups of up to 30 people can meet and in Scotland, up to 15 people from up to five different households can meet outside per day – all while keeping a distance.All of which means summer isn’t cancelled, it just looks somewhat different to how we imagined – but we can still get ready to brush up on our barbecuing and hosting skills.Now it’s trickier to go to the corner shop for extras, planning is of the essence. Here are our tips for hosting the perfect post-lockdown barbecue, and enjoying a safely sociable summer.Be considerateThe first rule of new-normal socialising is to be respectful of everyone’s boundaries. You might not mind sharing food with your guests, but others might be more anxious. Find out what everyone’s comfortable with before you plan your party – and if one of your friends would prefer to bring their own food, be prepared to be OK with that.Shop smartThanks to socially distanced shopping, the etiquette of putting on a barbecue has changed, too – it’s now perfectly reasonable to ask people to bring their own food or drink if they want something specific. Meanwhile, make sure you provide enough basics, to avoid a dash to the shops, mask in hand. You can find barbecue calculators online that will tell you how much meat, veg, side dishes and drink to buy depending on the number of people attending.Buy localWhile your online shop is ideal for stocking up on basics, a barbecue is the perfect excuse to explore your local area and uncover some hidden foodie gems. From artisan ciabatta rolls and locally produced meats, to small-batch chutneys, cheeses and ale, it’s a great time to support the independent stores reopening after lockdown. As well as boosting the economy, buying locally sourced produce keeps your carbon footprint clean, too.Stock up on masksJust as you’d make sure a guest didn’t drive home after a few drinks, protecting them if they have to get a cab or public transport home is equally thoughtful. Buy some masks to hand out to anyone who might suddenly need one at the end of the evening.Play it safeYou can’t control the weather – but you can make sure staying safe feels like a natural part of the party, rather than a chore. Put out plenty of hand sanitisers and wipes for guests, hand out glasses marked with their names, and hang 2-metre-long strips of bunting as a visual reminder not to mingle too closely. Spacing out your garden furniture around a central hub, such as a fire pit, will also help remind people to keep a distance without dampening the atmosphere.Create a signature dishWith more of us cooking at home than ever, it’s worth taking the time to develop a dish that will really wow your guests. Whether it’s making a lip-smacking vegan pulled “pork” (try BOSH’s for inspiration) or perfecting an all-American regional burger (make George Motz your go-to for recipes), head to your local butcher or farmers’ market, and start planning a grill everyone will remember for the right reasons.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

And we are doing exactly that.”The other draw is Minerva’s unusual curriculum, which is rooted in Nelson’s student campaigning at the University of Pennsylvania 25 years ago. “I realised that colleges were fundamentally failing in their promise to educate,” he says. “A liberal arts education is supposed to teach students to think freely, critically and logically. But our elite universities no longer do that at all.”The Minerva offering is very different to what most UK students were accustomed to, prior to the coronavirus pandemic shifting universities online. There are no lectures, faculty buildings, or exams. All teaching is done through online video classes. There is only one programme of study for first years, and rather than reading maths or history, students take courses aimed at teaching transferrable skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving, through classes named “multimodal communications”, “empirical analyses” and “complex systems”. Subject specialisms are chosen in the second year. There is no campus students are housed in a residence hall in San Francisco in their first year. Subsequent year groups spend semesters variously in Seoul, Hyderabad, Berlin, Buenos Aires, London and Taipei.The first undergraduate class enrolled in 2014. Among them was British teenager Kayla Cohen, who, armed with top A-level grades, had been selected out of 2,000 applicants to join a cohort of just 30 freshers. “It was a privilege, it was exciting,” says Cohen, now a 25-year-old graduate. “I remember the thrill of going to San Francisco, meeting my class, and feeling like I was joining the birth of something special.”Twenty-year-old Jade Bowler has just completed her first year at Minerva, and admits she was sceptical when she first learned about the institution from an online advert. “I was half-convinced it was a scam, it sounded like a cult,” she says. Bowler originally planned to read biology at Bristol University, so there was surprise when she decided to go to an obscure new US university. “I posted about my choice on social media and had thousands of people telling me not to go. But I just had a gut feeling that this was the future of education.”Minerva’s appeal, Bowler says, was its practical teaching style. “It’s so different from just sitting in a lecture theatre. You learn as you do, not learn by rote. And I have learned so much more in the past year than in any year of my life.”Study after study has shown the efficacy of active learning, and Nelson says Minerva has taken that research and implemented it. As such, professors are not supposed to speak in classes for any longer than a few minutes at a time, and students are expected to contribute to class discussions and group work.The online live video platform Forum is instrumental in facilitating this. “To achieve this kind of education, you have to have data,” says Nelson. “You have to actually be able to track how engaged every single student is.” This is achieved through a system that colour-codes students based on how much they talk in class.Allison Littlejohn, professor of learning technology at University College London, worries about the implications of data gathering for students. “Staff can see when a student logs on, how long they spend on an activity, how much they contribute to a discussion. There are real problems with this method: it puts a lot of pressure on students, and there are issues with privacy and surveillance. Everything a student does is monitored.”Currently half a dozen UK students have offers to study at Minerva this autumn. But despite its undeniable novelty, Littlejohn is doubtful that a university without lecture halls, societies and sports teams has mass appeal. “Lots of people go to campus-based universities not just for love of their subject, but for the whole experience of being a student on a campus, and all the social and extracurricular opportunities that offers,” she says. But Nelson believes the lack of a campus is a draw for some students. “At Minerva, you live in the heart of a city, in seven different countries,” he says. “There’s no campus cafeteria, or bar, or gym – your gym is the gym at the end of the road. Instead, you live as an adult in a city. You learn to be a global citizen.”Either way, Minerva’s innovations certainly pose a challenge to a sclerotic university model in both the US and the UK. Even if the venture does not upend the landscape of higher education in the way Nelson intends, campuses across the world will at some point have to address the deficiencies he identifies – and many already are as a result of the pandemic.“Many campuses are now realising the importance of flexible online learning, flipped classrooms, and interdisciplinary programmes,” Littlejohn agrees. But she adds: “There will always be a place for the campus, and for in-person teaching. At a campus with world-leading researchers, you see how academics spend their time and what they do. You see first-hand how knowledge is created.”The other crucial question is what’s really driving the success of Minerva’s graduates. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says: “A mix of excellent pre-university qualifications and a hyped-up higher education is likely to be a winning one. It is worth noting that it is much easier to deliver an excellent education to people with high prior qualifications than to students with more challenging backgrounds.”For the time being, Minerva graduates seem satisfied with their gamble. “I’ve learned so much, and I’m not sure I’d leave any other university with that same conclusion,” says Liberty Pim, who has just finished her final year. “Minerva built a completely new university without the constraints of a traditional university. When I applied it felt like a big risk, but it paid off.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5390906082c236a013494e14959bad0980e13e8/0_24_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=a5b5d64bfe1ab49565a2aa6b357086a3","title":"around the sun review multiple worlds romance oliver krimpas","story":"Oliver Krimpas’s flirty, sweet drama recalls Greenaway, Rohmer, Kieślowski and Kaufman and is uniquely weird and pleasingShot a few years ago in Normandy and shown at a few small film festivals back in the Before Times of 2019, this intimate and yet deliciously cerebral romance perfectly suits the lockdown mood of 2020. There are effectively only two, socially distant characters (if you don’t count the chap in golfing kit who passes fleetingly through silently towards the end).English northerner Maggie (Cara Theobold, from Downton Abbey, Last Tango in Halifax and Call the Midwife) is a young estate agent way too smart for the job. She has been assigned to show posh-spoken location scout Bernard (Game of Thrones alumnus Gethin Anthony) around an empty chateau. As they amble through the rooms and grounds, she explains to him how this was where Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle conceived his sui generis book Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds (a real thing indeed) in the 1680s – a scientific-philosophical musing on the heliocentric model of the universe that’s constructed as a series of conversations between a young marquise (much like Maggie), and Fontenelle himself, who shares a first name with our hero.As you would expect of a film about a book about multiple worlds, there’s some spiralling back and restarting of the story from different perspectives with key details changed, suggesting the fragile, random contingency of emotional entanglements, or maybe just because it can. It is as meta as a sentient ouroboros on a psychiatrist’s couch reviewing its own self-inflicted trauma, but also flirty, sweet and sort of breezy with melancholy bass notes.There are a hundred touchstones that could be invoked to suggest what it’s like: a Peter Greenaway script directed by Eric Rohmer, say, or a real-time Before Sunrise concept channelled through Krzysztof Kieślowski’s Blind ChanceSliding Doors parallel-world fiction, with a sugar dusting of Eugène Green highbrow whimsy and Charlie Kaufmanesque anxiety disorder. But fundamentally, this confident feature debut by British-Greek director Oliver Krimpas, elegantly written by Jonathan Kiefer, is unique, its own special, weird thing that leaves a long, pleasant, earthy aftertaste, like vintage calvados.• Around the Sun is available on digital platforms from 4 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29da1f88e9bb61b60b3669e0398eec279abb660d/0_183_4366_2620/master/4366.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=01358f37f3457b7ff054755e3ff49045","title":"how to make hummus recipe felicity cloake","story":"How to make the nation’s favourite dip with just a few store-cupboard ingredientsRemember the great hummus crisis of 2017, when the country went into meltdown over a temporary shortage of chickpea puree? Ah, they were happy days … Anyway, now the problem is more likely to be that you can’t face going to the shops to buy hummus, but the solution is the same: if you’ve got the ingredients, make your own.Prep 10 min, plus soakingCook Zero to 2 hr+, depending on the chickpeasServes 4200g dried chickpeas, or 1 x 400g tin or jar (see step 1)1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda (optional)3 garlic cloves, or to taste6 tbsp tahiniJuice of 1 lemon, or more to taste1 generous pinch ground cuminFine salt, to tasteExtra-virgin olive oil, to topIf you’re using dried chickpeas, which is my preference, because I think they have a better flavour, put them in a large bowl and cover with twice the volume of cold water.If you’re using a tin, skip straight to step four – the jarred Spanish kind are pricey, but their buttery texture makes it worth it if you can run to the expense.Stir in a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda, if using, and leave to soak for 24 hours – this will help the chickpeas soften more quickly, and give the finished hummus a creamier consistency, but if you don’t have it available, or really don’t like the flavour even in small amounts, leave it out.Drain and rinse the chickpeas, put them in a large pan with the remaining bicarb and cover again with cold water. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and leave to simmer gently until tender, adding more water if necessary – this will probably take a couple of hours, depending on the age of the chickpeas they should be easy to crush, but not falling apart.Leave the chickpeas to cool in the cooking liquid, then drain well, reserving the water. If using tinned or jarred chickpeas, drain them, and likewise keep their liquid. Set aside a spoonful of the chickpeas to use as a garnish. If you’d like a really silky end product, remove the papery skins (which should be falling off by this point anyway), by rubbing the chickpeas between your fingers it’s a fiddly job, true, but I think well worth it.Peel and crush the garlic (three cloves are my preference for this amount of chickpeas, but you may wish to add more, or less, depending on your tolerance for raw garlic), and put half of it in a small bowl.Stir in the tahini and half the lemon juice, to make a stiff paste, then gradually beat in just enough of the reserved chickpea water to loosen it to a pourable liquid consistency.Put this and the drained chickpeas in a food processor (or, if you’re using a stick blender, a sturdy bowl if you don’t have either, you can use a pestle and mortar to crush the chickpeas in batches, provided you have the time and patience – though you’ll need then to press it through a sieve to get the mix to the right texture.Blitz the chickpeas until really smooth, then add the cumin, a good pinch of salt and the rest of the garlic. With the motor still running, drizzle in enough of the reserved cooking water to get the desired consistency – the hummus should hold its shape, but not be heavy or claggy. Taste and add more salt, lemon or garlic, if you think it needs it.Spoon the hummus into a serving bowl and then pour a little olive oil around the side. Finish by scattering the reserved chickpeas in the centre you could also add a sprinkle of sesame seeds, za’atar, sumac or smoked paprika, if you fancy it, or indeed some fresh herbs such as finely chopped coriander or mint.Purists may be horrified, but hummus is a very versatile base. Add pureed cooked beetroot or other vegetables (roast red peppers or squash are particularly nice), or swap some of the chickpeas for other beans or pulses, if you prefer. Homemade (or, indeed, shop-bought) hummus is the perfect home for that almost empty jar of harissa or the last handful of frozen peas, so be creative."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2502a160c8289869466ffe3ec5c14307eff4457/0_0_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea93a56230d081047c14274bd942d822","title":"michelin quality food aldi prices lockdown how make most summer surplus british produce","story":"From artisan cheeses to king scallops, lockdown has left high-quality British produce looking for a home. Here’s what to do with it Coronavirus was an earthquake for British food and drink producers. With restaurants, pubs and office canteens shut, exports disrupted and Britons hoarding for lockdown, mismatches in supply chains were created, along with temporary shortages and huge gluts of surplus produce. All this meant farmers, fishermen and processors needed to find new retail opportunities.The aftershocks are still reverberating. Lockdown is easing, but British food is far from back to normal. From supermarkets selling seafood once destined for Michelin-starred restaurants to artisan cheesemakers offloading stock on waste-food apps, British producers are desperate for your support. For shoppers, there are bargains to be had. But which products are affected by surpluses? And what exciting things can you do with these ingredients?Usually sold to top restaurants, the Dorset Shellfish Company’s cockles and clams (£10.99£13.99 a kilo, respectively), which are approved by the Marine Stewardship Council, are available at 150 Waitrose fish counters. The supermarket says this offers a “lifeline” to the Poole harbour fishermen involved.Chilli-laden spaghetti alle vongole is an obvious dish for such clams, but Sai Deethwa, the owner of the Birmingham street food business Buddha Belly, recommends “clams stir-fried with roasted Thai chilli paste – AKA nam prik pao – tons of Thai basil and a little oyster sauce and water to create a liquor. It’s incredible.”At the Dining Room in Abersoch, Gwynedd, the chef-owner Si Toft loves cockles with fattier lamb cuts, such as rump: “Roast it in the pan then, while the lamb is resting, chuck the cockles through the rendered fat for two minutes with a little butter and cider, reduce it all and bang it over the lamb. It’s stunning.”Chip-shop closures left at least 95,000 tonnes of excess spuds in circulation. Versatile varieties such as Markies, Agria and Eurostar – usually described as chipping potatoes because they are bigger and uglier than their retail cousins – are circulating in Morrisons’ Wonky range and at other supermarkets. Such spuds are good for sautéing and making wedges – or what Toft describes as “the absolute king of family teas: dauphinoise layered with onions and bacon”. And the secret to perfect mash? Butter. And lots of it.“If you don’t have contracts, you don’t grow. If you stop, you don’t go back,” says Ali Capper, a hop grower at Stocks Farm in Worcestershire. “If this surplus halves prices, am I going to grow next year? No. We risk a significant proportion of hop growers leaving the industry.”The message is simple: drink more real ale made with English hops. Work it into your baking and cooking, too. “We use a half-beer base in cheese sauces,” says Sam Grainger, the executive chef at Belzan in Liverpool. “That yeasty, hoppy flavour really pushes it up.”Ordinarily, Britain eats medium and large brown eggs. Smaller and white eggs go into manufacturing, catering or fast food. But to cope with increased demand, Tesco is stocking surplus white eggs and Waitrose mixed-size boxes of 12 for 20p less than the equivalent weight of uniform eggs.With Easter and Eid celebrations quieter this year, and older shoppers who prefer it often isolating at home, lamb had a tough lockdown. Restaurants and export markets are opening, gradually, but there is a danger, particularly in September as new-season lamb comes through, of problems with so-called carcass balance – whereby lamb mince sells well, but roasting joints and other cuts are neglected. Chefs find that baffling. “Cider-braised lamb breast is amazing” – cover in foil and cook for three to four hours at 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4 – “as are lamb shortribs,” says Toft.Deethwa is a big fan of lamb massaman curry: “Because it’s slightly sweet, lamb lends itself to the tamarind’s sourness – and you can slow-cook shank, neck and shoulder because it’s nice and fatty.”The Cornish Cheese Co is selling frozen 5kg bags of blue cheese – which is fine for cooking – for £25 through the food-waste app Too Good to Go, while Aldi, after buying four tonnes of surplus stock, has launched 475g mixed boxes of small-producer British cheese for £1.49. That illustrates how traumatic 2020 has been for some artisan cheese producers.At Belzan, Grainger is amazed more people are not cooking with blue cheese: “We do a delicious wild mushroom and baked eggs dish with it,” he says. “You can coat salads in blue cheese sauce blended with yoghurt – beetroot is great, as are roasted peaches baked with blue cheese and parma ham.”If you are quick, you will catch the back end of asparagus season at Waitrose, which is stocking larger, smaller, fatter, thinner and curved asparagus that, historically, it would have rejected. Toft suggests gently barbecuing it: “Dressing-wise, go burnt lemon” – char half a lemon, then mix the juice with oil and salt – “or bacon-fat hollandaise. You wazz rendered bacon fat through hollandaise instead of butter. It’s amazing on asparagus.”In what it says is “a bid to make sure homegrown produce doesn’t go to waste”, Waitrose has relaxed its rules on the blemishes and bumps that would normally result in carrots and parsnips being sold to mass-catering outlets rather than gracing its aisles.If you have an abundance of carrots, the Indian dessert halwa – 1kg of carrots to serve four(!), although it varies by recipe – is one way to deploy them. For those with less of a sweet tooth, Mayur Patel, the co-owner of the northern mini-chain Bundobust, recommends sambharo, “a kind of desi slaw, served on the side of every curry”. Temper mustard seeds, green chillies and a little asafoetida in oil. After this cools, add lemon juice and mix through shredded carrot. Let it marinade for a couple of hours before serving.From Belzan’s carrot-top pesto (200g carrot tops blended with 50g Parmesan, 1 tbsp dijon mustard, juice of one lemon, eight brown anchovies, 100ml oil and seasoning) to Buddha Belly’s som tam green papaya salad, in which carrots add “sweet, crunchy balance”, this is a versatile vegetable. But faced with a bag of wonky carrots or parsnips, many of us will think soup – so how do you make those soups sing?You need, suggests Elaine Mason, from the soup bar Union of Genius in Edinburgh, acid: “Lemon, lime, a touch of vinegar cooked off. Parsnips loves the tart sweetness apple adds. Roast them first if there’s time, but tinker with acid and spices like coriander seed, cumin and sumac.” And don’t forget garnishes: “Soy-roasted seeds on top add texture, salt and savour. Harissa-roasted chickpeas bring heat and crunch.”Supermarkets sold hundreds of thousands of discounted steaks at the peak of lockdown. With restaurant recovery patchy and markets volatile, stay alert for more beefy bargains. Grainger recommends marinating cheaper steaks in “soy, fish sauce and palm sugar to get the caramelised crust you get from expensive cuts with better fat”.Dire as such prices sound for fishermen, one major supplier, Ocean Fish, considers this moment an opportunity. (Its Cornish sardines are £5.99 a kilo at Waitrose.) “Supermarkets should play a role in backing British fish,” says a spokesperson, adding: “Selling greater volumes into supermarkets could even support the drop in market value for certain species.”Grainger soaks sardine fillets in sherry vinegar before breadcrumbing and frying them. Toft also keeps it simple with dover sole: “Barbecue it. You get a higher temperature, char and that smoky thing going.” Rub the slashed skin with oil, lemon, rosemary and salt – flavoured salt if you have something suitable. “Flavoured salts will lift any white fish.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d483b6d3c1f2c1b4654925485c476091c2b18ac/0_154_3300_1980/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b588b34f79547322f5337577e129944a","title":"brentford swansea city championship play off semi final second leg match report","story":"A night for moving on. For shedding baggage, and laying the past to rest. On the night Brentford said their farewells to Griffin Park, they came closer to top-flight football than they have done at any point since 1947. They did so with a sparkling modern brand of football quite at odds with the weathered girders and sardine seats of their old home.Fulham or Cardiff lie in wait at a deserted Wembley Stadium on Tuesday, the final fixture in this strangest of seasons, and if Brentford are to break their hoodoo of eight successive play-off failures they can ask for few better platforms. Few better front-threes than Saïd Benrahma, Ollie Watkins and Bryan Mbeumo. Few better midfield conductors than Mathias Jensen, who amid the mayhem and flying tackles ran this game on strings.Few better owners than the visionary Matthew Benham. Few better managers than Thomas Frank, who as well as instilling an elastic, spine-tingling, relentlessly percussive style of play has also forced Brentford to dream big, to write a new chapter in a cherished history.Of course, breaking into the world’s richest league requires more than a healthy sense of predestination. You need to suffer and you need to sweat, and on a warm evening both these sides played their part in an arrestingly physical encounter. Frank had promised in the buildup he would carry his exhausted players off the pitch at the end if necessary, and in a stunning, full-throttle opening 15 minutes that turned the tie on its head, his team were as good as his word.It began, as so many of Brentford’s moves do, from the very back: the goalkeeper David Raya finding Jensen, the Denmark Under-21 midfielder on the fringes of the full team. All night Jensen pulled Swansea this way and that, and here he played the sort of defence-splitting pass – fully 60 yards, all along the ground, straight down the middle – that you wanted to watch again and again. It was a pass with its own impossible choreography, right down to the perfectly-timed run of Watkins, who finished with an assassin’s cool for his 26th goal of the season.Perhaps Swansea were a little concussed by the brutal, geometric coldness of that goal. Certainly that would explain the momentary loss of defensive shape that allowed Benrahma to advance to the edge of their area just moments later. As Swansea’s midfield collapsed on to the back three like a boxer sinking into the deadly embrace of the ropes, Benrahma had all the time in the world to flop a delicious cross on to the head of Emiliano Marcondes. In the space of four minutes Brentford were 2-0 up and Swansea’s one-goal cushion had turned into an ejector seat.The dangerous Benrahma was beginning to grow into the game, enjoying a string of decent openings, at one point clattering the inside of a post after a magical little exchange with Jensen. Swansea’s best chance came through Conor Gallagher, and as half-time approached they had just about managed to stem the bleeding. But within barely a minute of the restart, Brentford hit them again: Jensen again, releasing Rico Henry (reprieved from suspension after being sent off in the first leg), crossing for Mbeumo to volley home with authority and swagger.With 12 minutes to go, Pontus Jansson’s terrible fluffed clearance was punished by a marvellous bit of inspiration from Rhian Brewster, lifting the ball over the advancing Raya from 30 yards. Now, as Swansea threw themselves into one last effort, Brentford’s defence would step up. Raya made a wonderful save from Connor Roberts. Christian Norgaard made two or three crucial clearances in a row. And for all the miles in the legs, the 101 matches these two sides had already dragged themselves through this season, remarkably the final stages of the game were just as intense and spellbinding as the first.A striking and unfamiliar sound filled the air in the minutes after full-time. Fans pouring out of the pubs and the terraced houses into Braemar Road, gathering outside the ground and giving the old place a raucous send-off. There is talk of a proper farewell at some point, perhaps even a socially-distanced exhibition game. But in a sense, this was the perfect way for it to end. The stands will soon be houses. A gleaming new chapel awaits just one stop up the line at Kew Bridge.Time, in more senses than one, for Brentford to take the next step."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97da1919c657b21428d93fe573776065f0c7ad95/178_162_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2fb290aaced0301cfdca783c858bf33","title":"paulo dybala juventus footballers presidents common goal serie a champions league","story":"The Juventus forward on joining Common Goal, winning another Serie A title and the Champions League challenge aheadIt is only a few days since Juventus beat Sampdoria to seal their ninth consecutive Scudetto, and Paulo Dybala already has his mind on other challenges. Football still has plenty of those in store for him, of course, particularly with his team taking a one-goal deficit into next Friday’s Champions League game at home to Lyon, but recently he has been considering other matters entirely.“I’ve given to charity before,” he says, “but I’ve always done it anonymously, because the purpose is not to get publicity but to help those in need. But I think to be part of this initiative, to be one of 159 people working together, is important in a different way. We’ve come together as a group and we want to work as a team in solidarity with people less fortunate than ourselves.”Footballers who sign up to Common Goal can input into where they want their money to be used, and Dybala’s will go towards projects not only in his native Argentina but also in Israel, Palestine, Pakistan, India and Rwanda. “It is something that I decided with my family and the people I work with, and my mother is going to be very involved in the movement,” he says. “For her this is a very beautiful and very important project. We have always tried to help people – my mother always likes to tell me it’s something I have to do, and of course I have to respect her opinion.“Sometimes I look at society and I see things that I would like to change. It sounds ridiculous, but I would love to be able to change the world in just a small way. The truth is that football is a powerful weapon. For whatever reason, the things we say are heard around the world, and lots of people pay more attention to footballers than they do to presidents and prime ministers and important politicians. I think we have to use the power we are given to send positive messages, and to be strong role models. I believe that if everyone in football came together we could give so much and achieve so much, to help people in need and to fulfil the ambitions of so many children.”Dybala says that “football is my passion and it has been my life since I was three years old”, but he is aware that had he failed to make it as a player he would have faced an uncertain future as someone with no qualifications and few outside interests, and the focus of his charitable work is informed by his own experience.“I know so many people, friends of mine, who came so close but football is like life – a lot of the time it is not just about what you do, but about who sees it, and what they think about it. Along the way you need a lot of luck. A lot of my friends never made it, and at a certain moment found themselves a bit lost, not knowing what to do and which way to go.“I had the good fortune to get where I have, but if it hadn’t happened for me I’ve no idea what I would have done. That’s what I keep thinking about. Many young people who dream of going into football never learn anything else, and they never know about all the alternative paths that might have been there for them. I think education is such a powerful tool for giving people a helping hand. Once a person has an education there is so much they can achieve that might otherwise have been beyond them. Football can help bring people into education, give them a future and the potential to live a full life.”Dybala talks of his life after football, in which he hopes “to have more time to spend with my family, but also more time to help other people”. He has much to achieve before that, with his sporting CV featuring no international or European trophies but plenty of Italian domestic honours including five Scudetti. In England no team have won more than three league titles in a row, and before this Juve side the Italian record stood at five.“It can be hard to maintain concentration and ambition, but every victory is special,” he says. “I think that’s the most important thing. I like to win, my teammates like to win, and the club likes to win, and it’s that desire that makes us winners – but of course it helps that we have the strongest players in the world in every position. We’re proud of ourselves, to win nine titles in a row is incredible, and we’re already thinking about a 10th.“First though we need to turn our attention to the Champions League. It’s been such a long season already. The first game against Lyon was five months ago and so many things have happened in between, but we know what we can still achieve. It’ll be strange to play in the Champions League without fans, and to play just one tie in each round, but first we have to win in Turin. For now, that’s all that matters.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/673a3cedac3944159f37743eb7580e96e6453e34/0_108_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a459d795209e823bb5f7cb64df74bc2","title":"ciro immobile goldilocks footballer or deserved goal record chaser lazio serie a","story":"The Lazio striker stands one shy of Gonzalo Higuaín’s record and, 14 penalties or not, he has enjoyed a stellar campaignTo listen to Ciro Immobile on Wednesday night was to wonder whether he might be in the wrong line of work. “I hate it when I absolutely have to score,” he said at the end of Lazio’s 2-0 win over Brescia. “It just doesn’t sit right.”A surprising sentiment, for a man who has made his living scoring goals – and who happens to be very good at it. Immobile netted his 35th of this Serie A campaign just a few minutes earlier, running on to Joaquín Correa’s through-ball and sweeping one of his calling-card sidefoot finishes beyond the goalkeeper Lorenzo Andrenacci.Yet this was an occasion when Immobile really ought to have had a hatful. Moments before, he had missed from an almost identical position. Afterwards, he had a shot well saved by Andrenacci before seeing another crash off the post. He made no attempt to hide his frustration, collapsing on his back following the first of those misses and glaring at the night sky. After the last, he pelted the ball into an advertising hoarding. Even at the final whistle, he stood and gesticulated grumpily by the centre-circle.All this, for a game Lazio had won – not that the result mattered a great deal. Their place in the top four was already guaranteed, as was Brescia’s relegation.When Immobile spoke of an obligation to score, he was referring only to his personal bid to beat Gonzalo Higuaín’s record for most goals in a Serie A season. Wednesday’s strike leaves him one short of the mark set by the Argentinian four years ago. Immobile had hoped for more against opponents who have conceded 78 this season.He still has one more game to reach his target. Fittingly, it is against Napoli – the team for which Higuaín was playing when he set the record. Naples is also where Immobile grew up. As a youngster, it was his dream to play for the Partenopei, though these days he says his heart belongs only to Lazio.How could it not? Immobile’s career was drifting off course when the Biancocelesti signed him in the summer of 2016 for less than €10m. He had swapped Serie A for the Bundesliga two years before, scoring just three times in 24 league appearances at Borussia Dortmund before enduring a similarly unhappy spell at Sevilla, who packed him off on loan after six months.At Lazio, things were different from the start. Immobile arrived in the same summer as Simone Inzaghi, who structured his whole team to play to the striker’s strengths: a fast-breaking, vertical football designed to draw opponents on and then release No 17 into the spaces they left behind.It has been an unqualified success, Immobile scoring 102 times in 141 Serie A appearances. He was the ision’s top scorer in 2017-18 despite missing five matches with a hamstring injury. Without it, he might even have challenged Leo Messi for that season’s European Golden Shoe.He is in position to claim the award this time around, his goal against Brescia moving him ahead of Robert Lewandowski. Cristiano Ronaldo could yet overtake him, but now sits three behind with one game remaining – which he might not even start. Maurizio Sarri has threatened to field Juventus’s Under-23s against Roma so that first-teamers can rest before their Champions League last-16 clash with Lyon.Immobile has been aided by Serie A’s implementation of VAR and strict interpretation of the new handball rule. A whopping 14 of his goals have come from penalties, in a season when the league long ago shattered its record for most spot-kicks awarded. Only three of Higuaín’s 36 goals came from penalties in 2015-16.Does that diminish the achievement? For many, it will. Even if you were to discard penalties completely, however, he would still be Serie A’s top scorer this season on 21.Whichever way you slice it, this has been an impressive campaign. Yet Immobile has been the first to criticise his own performances. As Lazio’s title challenge evaporated following the restart – with four defeats in their first five July games – he shared his frustration at not feeling able to get himself back in the zone. “The team plays for me,” he told the in-house radio station, Lazio Style. “I still have personal objectives to chase but I must not get myself nervous. Since lockdown, I have not been myself, I need to get back to being calm.”These felt like telling remarks from a player who has been accused many times by his critics of lacking the steel to succeed at the highest levels. A player who successive Italy managers have looked to for leadership up front, but who has delivered only 10 goals in 39 appearances for the national side – and almost all of those against lesser footballing nations.Is his simply the story of a “Goldilocks” footballer, one who needs a team set up just right to exploit his undeniable talents for timing a run, for finding space and for beating a goalkeeper one-on-one? Or is there another layer, hinted at again by his comments on Wednesday, of simply putting too much pressure on himself at times, of building a layer of unnecessary burden?Immobile’s season for Lazio has been another brilliant one – regardless of whether Higuaín’s record falls. His goals have been supplemented with nine assists, including one for Correa against Brescia. Even as teammates fought furiously to force the ball to him in scoring positions, he continued to serve them as well.You would be hard-pressed to find any colleague of Immobile’s who feels that he has let them down in the final part of this season. You would find many who are desperate to help him to claim his record on Sunday, and finish on a happier note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecce4f2a81f8c7df3c59fc5edc716cb91f88c331/17_526_6121_3672/master/6121.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=eec990bfc13f33cfb494df22b49cbe39","title":"unwind in malta your long weekend itinerary for a dose of r and r","story":"With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, it’s always the right time to kick back and relax in this culture-rich countryWritten about by Homer as the archipelago where the nymph Calypso so beguiled Ulysses that he stayed for seven years, the Maltese islands remain idyllically beautiful. They offer visitors spectacular beaches, cobalt sea, prehistoric sites dating back more than 5,000 years, and soul-soothingly beautiful natural landscapes. With more than 300 days of sunshine a year, Malta is ideal for some restorative R\u0026ampR, and you can get here with minimal stress, no jet lag, and only a short-haul flight from the UK.Day one: soak up VallettaStart to unwind in Valletta, Malta’s elegant coastal capital, where five-star and boutique hotels offer spa treatments, massages and hot tubs and pools overlooking beautiful views. You could spend your first day exploring some of the attractions of this Unesco world heritage site, one of the world’s most beautiful and unspoilt cities. Its pedestrianised centre is full of pavement cafes to relax and enjoy a drink in the warm sunshine. You can dine in the evening at outdoor, sea-facing restaurants, eating fresh seafood and other delicious local cuisine, and enjoy the warm Mediterranean sun.Day two: more spas, speedboats and the ‘silent city’Valletta is renowned for its spectacular boutique hotels, such as the glorious Palazzo Consiglia with an underground spa and rooftop pool. One suite in SU29 has a rooftop Jacuzzi-with-a-view, as do the suites in the historic townhouse of Casa Ellul. Locanda La Gelsomina, over the harbour in the even-more-relaxing small town of Birgu, offers in-house massages, private yoga and a Japanese Zen sound bath.Once you’ve spent a day smoothing out any knots, it’s an easy trip by bus or car to take it easy on the beautiful beaches of Golden Bay or Għajn Tuffieħa for a day of beach relaxation. This astoundingly scenic chain of soft-sanded beaches is lapped by the warm Mediterranean Sea, and offers every kind of watersports: indulge in some stand-up paddleboarding, waterskiing or take a speedboat along the coast to see the otherworldly rock formations and caves that glint with reflected blue light. The beachfront Radisson Blu Resort \u0026amp Spa has superb spa facilities, or you could base yourself in a seaside town such as Mellieħa, close to another white-sanded beach, with lots of hotel choices.A cobweb-clearing walk along Malta’s Dingli cliffs offers sweeping panoramas for miles across the ocean, and you could finish the day with a meal in the tranquil “silent city” of Mdina. This hilltop, walled, golden-stone old capital, with its atmospheric and historic narrow lanes, is best experienced after all the daytime visitors have ebbed away.Days three and four: go Zen in GozoOn your third and fourth days, slow down your pace even more by heading to the neighbouring smaller island of Gozo, only a short trip by ferry. Hidden coves are reached via flights of vertiginous steps, with pale copper sands lapped by azure waters. Artist and poet Edward Lear visited in the 19th century and was so taken with this curious, dramatic landscape that he invented words to describe it: calling it “pomskizillious” and “gromophiberous”.Gozo’s country roads are ideal for cycling or walks, with sea views and seemingly hugely outsized churches in the middle of the countryside. The island’s famous for the warmth and hospitality of its locals, and is the kind of place where no one bothers locking their front door. Gozo is famous for its large, rentable “farmhouses” with gardens and pools, as well as some spectacular hotels, such as chic haven ThirtySeven and the five-star hideaway Kempinski Hotel San Lawrenz. You can also dine on spectacular fresh Mediterranean produce here. Gozo has many renowned restaurants, serving zero-mileage local cuisine cooked by some of the best chefs on the archipelago, with ingredients such as the local fresh cheese, locally grown tomatoes and olives, fresh fish, and local wines.Gozo’s five-star spas offer a wide range of treatments and therapies from across the world as well as saunas, Jacuzzis, steam rooms and indoor swimming pools.A longer restIf two days isn’t long enough, extend your Gozo trip with yoga and pilates retreats, which are ideal for longer wellness stays. The week-long Paola’s BodyBarre retreat, for example, gives you the chance to take part in daily pilates, barre, fitness and yoga fusion sessions, as well as excursions to copper-sanded Ramla Bay, the cerulean Blue Lagoon, Gozo’s coastal salt pans, and the vast Ġgantija temples, which predate Stonehenge. The next retreat will take place in 2021, for more information email: office.uk@visitmalta.It’s remarkable how many relaxation and wellness activities you can fit in over a four-day weekend trip to Malta, recharging in beautiful settings or keeping active outdoors (although longer trips to Malta and Gozo are to be encouraged – there’s a lot that cannot be covered in a four-day trip). Book your wellness trip to Malta today to restore a sense of balance, for a holiday whose effects will last long after your return.In the wake of Covid-19 things are changing fast, so do check the latest advice from the Foreign Office before making any travel decisions and contact any hotels, restaurants or attractions mentioned in this article for the latest information on availability and opening times.

And can these ideas be fought with education? We spoke to experts to see whether it will work.Russell Muirhead, who co-authored the book A Lot of People Are Saying, which digs into how misinformation spreads online, says that social media work to validate and legitimize conspiracy theorizing and misinformation.“On a platform like Twitter, and to some extent on Facebook and YouTube, repetition comes to substitute validation. If enough people like the tweet, or watch the video, or like the video on YouTube, it confers a kind of legitimacy,” he says.He gives the example of a common refrain of Donald Trump’s to exemplify this: Trump will say “I don’t know if it’s true but a lot of people are saying it” – as if people simply repeating misinformation means it must have some truth to it.“That’s very threatening to our ability to understand the world and to democratic politics. Because anything people retweet enough times seems true – regardless of whether or not it is,” he says.Muirhead points out that before social media, it was the norm for media outlets to have a gatekeeping function. Editors, the gatekeepers of traditional media, are tasked everyday with deciding what makes it on air or into print – and an established first criterion is truthfulness:“The more likely a claim is to be judged false, the less likely the editor will decide to put it in the paper or on the air. What’s happened with Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is the gatekeeping function has been displaced: anybody can say anything to anyone in the whole world, pretty much for free,” he says.Dr Whitney Phillips, author of This is Why we Can’t Have Nice Things, points out that a “marketplace of ideas approach” to misinformation (which posits that if you combat problematic speech with more speech, the truth will eventually prevail) doesn’t work in our current online environment.“That ideal does not take into account algorithms the various affordances of digital media that float and incentivize certain types of sensationalist content – it is simply not the case that all voices carry equally on social media or that all information carries equally,” she says.But one problem is that misinformation and conspiracy have generally found fertile ground on social media, according to Phillips.But does refusing to publish misinformation and baseless conspiracy feed into the conspiracist mindset, making conspiracists more determined in their worldview?Muirhead suggests not. He mentions Spotify’s decision, followed by subsequent outlets such as Apple, YouTube and Twitter to take conspiracist Alex Jones’ radio show Infowars off its platforms. Jones spread a debunked conspiracy theory about the Sandy Hook massacre, suggesting it was staged by actors. He was held liable for defamation in US courts for those claims that also led to real-world, palpable harm: a grieving father was subject to death threats, and the woman who hounded him was given a five-month prison sentence.Phillips explains that the conspiratorial mindset does, of course, affect the ways that conspiracists take in information, but argues that the cost to society of letting these ideas flourish is too great to ignore.“But QAnon is not just a random narrative with no consequences – for years it’s been bubbling up and people have been conducting violence under its auspices … For Twitter to take that stance, that they are acknowledging harm and predicating moderation decisions based on harm I think that’s good,” she says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b19d8e31d91efcaf484d023e31e8957d9b04947c/0_90_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ab36af472711eba69ff54732c1b498c","title":"how did britain get so overweight podcast","story":"As the government launches a newly interventionist strategy to tackle obesity, the ’s Felicity Lawrence looks at whether it goes far enough to take on the might of the food industryBoris Johnson once scoffed at what he saw as the “nanny state” instincts of politicians who sought to tackle the growing waistlines of the British public.

The landing site is one of the most promising spots for any microbial Martians to have been preserved in rock formed when the crater held a lake nine times larger than Loch Ness.The $2.7bn (£2.1bn) rover carries a suite of instruments to analyse rocks for “biosignatures” – the chemical hallmarks of life – but will cache other samples on the surface for collection and return to Earth onboard a future mission.Bad weather and technical glitches aside, the Perseverance mission will embark on its half-a-billion kilometre voyage at 12.50pm BST on Thursday when the engines of the Atlas V rocket it is strapped to light up at Cape Canaveral, Florida.With coronavirus raging in the southern state, few scientists and engineers will be in Florida to witness the launch and will instead follow events online.“It’s an early launch for us,” said Ken Williford, the deputy project scientist at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. “I’ll need to be up around 3am, though I don’t know if I’ll be able to sleep.“Our plan was to have thousands of people there. Our science team alone is 400 people and everybody was going to be invited. It’s very different. We’ll be celebrating remotely.” Even without the pandemic to contend with, the mission has been a challenge. Beyond developing powerful new instruments and an upgraded autopilot system, engineers built a helicopter for the rover to deploy, the first to take to the air on another planet.Named Ingenuity, the 1.8kg helicopter will be a “pathfinder” for future rotorcraft that scout ahead of robotic rovers, and perhaps even astronauts, and explore terrain beyond the reach of either, said MiMi Aung, the Ingenuity project manager. Should Perseverance touch down safely, Ingenuity will attempt up to five flights over 30 days, clawing into the thin Martian air with four 1.2-metre-long carbon-fibre blades spinning at 2,400rpm.“The nervousness and nail-biting will come on the surface,” Aung told the . “Surviving the first night for us is going to be huge.”But first it has to get there. Trips to Mars are daunting feats and the recent successes of Nasa’s Mars Insight and Curiosity missions do nothing to change that. The low Martian gravity and the rarefied atmosphere make entry, descent and landing so fraught that flight engineers are prone to use the word “terror”.After seven months of interplanetary travel, in February 2021 the spacecraft will punch into the Martian sky at such a speed that its heat shield will sear at 2,370C (4,298F). With thrusters for control, the probe will streak towards its landing site, pop a parachute and then cut it loose, descending the final 10km to the surface on eight retrorockets.All being well, Perseverance will land in the Jezero crater on the western edge of Isidis Planitia, a giant impact basin north of the Martian equator. The site was picked from more than 60 candidates because of its promise for preserving signs of life. The crater was once home to an ancient lake and river delta that may have collected and buried Martian microbes and locked them in rocks made from compacted clay or mud.Mounted on the end of its robotic arm are two instruments that Perseverance will use to search for signs of past life, or promising rocks to return to Earth. The Pixl (planetary instrument for X-ray lithochemistry) can blast rocks with a small but powerful beam to reveal their elemental makeup. Another tool, named Sherloc, will scan rocks for organic molecules and minerals. Hints of life may lie not only in organics, but the textures and patterns of compounds scientists see in the rocks.“It is very likely that any signs of life we do find will be very ambiguous, very difficult to interpret, and difficult or impossible to achieve true scientific consensus on,” Williford said. “We have very good capabilities for finding potential signs of life, but we’ll need to get those samples back and have many different people study them with many different techniques for years to achieve anything like scientific consensus.”Mark Sephton, an astrobiologist at Imperial College London, is part of the team that will decide which half a kilo of rocks to bring back to Earth, an unprecedented feat Nasa may achieve with the European Space Agency in 2031.“We could be about to step over quite a profound threshold,” he said. “We talk about the possibility of finding life on Mars, but people forget that if that happens and it’s conclusive, that’s a step change. That’s a line you cross and you never go back. It tells us that everywhere in the universe, where you’ve got the right conditions, the right raw materials, and a bit of time, that life should spring up.“I’m excited, but nervous that anything might happen which stops the opportunity of a lifetime. It’s such a privilege to be involved. It’s historical. I don’t want anything to go wrong.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fb872d95c23d1ae49d8af51b7e9e752e6658396/0_0_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d303e4348354c7f24155bdbbb4d8ef82","title":"mps say government must appoint food security minister in wake of pandemic","story":"Report warns second wave could see food poverty increase and suggests enshrining ‘right to food’ in lawMinisters should consider enshrining in law a right to food and must appoint a new minister for food security, according to an influential committee of MPs, after the coronavirus pandemic exposed serious problems with the government’s handling of the food system in a crisis.A second wave of Covid-19 could sharply increase the number of people at risk of food shortages and hunger, which already stands at 6.6 million, including 1.7 million children, the report by the environment, food and rural affairs select committee found.Panic buying – which was often just consumers responding to the need to eat all meals at home – and shortages of some staples in the shops, characterised the start of the Covid-19 crisis after the government failed to communicate properly with the public and the food industry, the MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee found in a new report.The government “appeared unprepared” for the impact of the closure of restaurants and cafes, they said, and was too slow to provide guidance for workers in the food supply sector.They warned that the UK faces more serious threats to the food supply, including a coronavirus second wave, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, and in the longer term the climate crisis, this will require more interventions by government. The UK was kept supplied during lockdown by imports of food from overseas, but any disruption to cross-border trade could provoke more serious impacts on food availability.During the early stages of lockdown, there were reports of farmers pouring fresh milk away, or unable to find a market for meat and fish. There were calls for a land army to bring in the harvest, if foreign workers could not be brought in, and concerns over food waste as well as shortages.Neil Parish, chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, said: “Despite warnings from other countries, it seemed as though the government was constantly playing catch-up in trying to support the food industry during the crisis. There were misunderstandings in government about where and how people were going to get their food just before and during lockdown.”He warned that the “disturbing spike in demand for food aid” was “likely to get worse before it gets better”, with people thrown out of work and the economy in recession.Kath Dalmeny, chief executive of the food and farming alliance Sustain, said MPs were right to raise concerns, as the Covid-19 crisis had highlighted a longstanding problem. “For far too long, the government has ignored the fact that millions of people experience household food insecurity every day. They won’t even measure it properly, so that we can all face the facts and discuss what to do about it,” she told the .She called on the government to ensure that older people and those with disabilities, who received food parcels while shielding, were not left without provision, and for ministers to prepare now in case of a second wave.The committee paid tribute to key workers in the food industry, as well as food banks and other food redistribution organisations catering to vulnerable people, whom the chairman commended as having “reacted heroically”. The response from department for environment, food and rural affairs was also judged satisfactory in many ways in the end. But the MPs insisted more must be done to ensure a better response to looming threats.Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West, and a committee member, pointed to the fact that 6.6 million people were currently in food insecurity, amid fully stocked supermarkets and while furlough provisions remain in place.“This is the shameful condition of the UK after ten years of austerity,” he said. “But there’s much worse to come. We face the cliff-edge of the end of furlough in October, as the UK braces itself for a second wave of coronavirus followed by a disorderly Brexit. The combination of a greater financial squeeze on the poorest families alongside a resurgence of disease and food shortages will hurtle millions more into food insecurity and hunger in the UK.”Earlier this week, the National Food Strategy recommended extending free school meals to another 1.5 million children living in low-income families, and for school holiday clubs offering healthy meals. The government was forced into a U-turn in June after the Manchester United football player Marcus Rashford raised concerns over children going hungry when the vouchers they were given to replace free school meals were to be stopped over the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1893224ea1b22a2222cbbe71e33a1cba07ef93fa/0_211_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2d95a84c4d6a72f809ea064c679b70b","title":"complex challenging f1 silverstone covid 19 british gp 70th anniversary gp","story":"Planning a normal grand prix takes 18 months but Silverstone has had only eight weeks to arrange two. It has been a task like no other but one vital to the survival of the circuitHistory and heritage have long been important to Silverstone, the scene of drama and spectacle, triumph and despair. The former airfield hosted the first Formula One world championship grand prix 70 years ago, and F1 was coming home as 2020 promised a celebratory meeting before the pandemic cast its shadow across the globe.Planning a party has became a process of adaptation, compromise and contingency just to go racing again. With the British Grand Prix and the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix presenting a double-header of races at Silverstone beginning this weekend, the circuit and Formula One have succeeded, but it has been far from straightforward.When Silverstone put itself forward to host not one but two grands prix as part of the rescheduled season, the scale of the challenge was clear. It is easier to host 350,000 people over the weekend in a normal year than a mere several thousand under the spectre of Covid-19. It has been a task like no other, but one that has been vital to the survival of the circuit.The pandemic shutdown was a body blow to the business. “We need to have a good, strong well-attended F1 race if we are not to have a challenging year. Then it got taken out of our hands,” says Silverstone’s managing director, Stuart Pringle. “The country got shut down, our business had to close its gates. I had no idea things would become so bad and so difficult for Silverstone. On 23 March we shut our doors and we didn’t have anybody back on track until the beginning of June.”When F1 began restructuring the season, with seven teams based in the UK, unsurprisingly they looked to Silverstone. Pringle stepped up, offering to host 12 races if required. Silverstone accepted that fans could not attend, that the financial return would be nowhere near the usual volume and that the race weekends would be run differently but that it was still worth taking on.“Running these two races is not going to be as good for Silverstone as running one traditional GP,” says Pringle. “We are a venue that values its fans, that is about the experience and atmosphere. Financially it is nothing like as good either, but it is better than nothing and it contributes to starting to fill the enormous hole.”Planning a normal GP weekend typically takes 18 months. Coming out of lockdown Silverstone had eight weeks to put these two meetings together. Leading this task is Alex Lacey, the operations director, who has worked at the circuit for 23 years. In a normal year her team has a tried-and-tested method for putting together the infrastructure, facilities and staff. The new reality required a whole new methodology.“The instruction to everyone was start with a blank sheet of paper and build this up piece by piece,” she says. “It has been a challenge because it has been an ever-evolving situation in relation to the pandemic. The government guidelines have been changing, the requirements from the FIA and F1 have been ever-evolving. In a lot of instances we felt like we have gone round in circles, one step forward and two steps back. It has been tough, sometimes frustrating but worthwhile.”This weekend there will be no fans but instead an endless effort to implement “mitigation measures”. They include cleaning processes, testing regimes, the creation of working bubbles, new working practices and amendments to operational plans – arranging, for example, for 60 utilitarian cabins to take the place of the lavish F1 motor homes. Instead of 7,000 staff on site they must function with 3,000 – a figure that includes F1 teams, support races personnel, marshals, officials, broadcasters and media. Every feasible scenario has had to be considered, including those of the worst case. Northamptonshire’s director of public health, Lucy Wightman, has been involved in the process since it began. If there are positive test results or indeed a Covid-19 outbreak, Wightman and her team will step in to look at quarantine and isolation measures, contact tracing and, if necessary, take over.That is, of course, a picture the sport hopes to avoid but the minutiae has to be considered as well. “Normally we welcome fans but we have had to establish an operation plan which actually deters and keeps people away from the venue,” Lacey says.In the expectation that some will still be drawn by F1’s forbidden roar, an entirely new procedure has been developed. Only local residents will be allowed into the area around the circuit and roads will be closed, as will footpaths, bridleways and local campsites. Even the airspace is restricted, with drones banned. Superintendent Dennis Murray, Northamptonshire police’s event commander, described it as an “exclusion zone”.Yet the show will go on. Silverstone expects to ensure this weekend that the British Grand Prix keeps it place on the F1 calendar , having hosted a meeting in every season of the world championship since it began. History will continue to be written here, even against the odds. “I am excited,” says Pringle. “We do what we do because we get a thrill from putting on something that is complex, challenging and demanding. Running this year’s event has been all of those things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8857a2506f4ae8320b2095e4c5f840867b168b64/0_90_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a4a21880604c7d8a7249cbfa4db6c30","title":"nba restart playoff predictions 2020","story":"The Lakers, Bucks and Clippers are among the hot favorites as the NBA resumes its season following a four-month hiatusThe NBA resumes play after a four-and-a-half-month hiatus on Thursday night as 22 teams pick up their pursuit of a championship inside the bubble at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. Here’s an idea of what to expect from 2020 2.0.Los Angeles Clippers stars Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have had months to rest and prepare for the playoffs, but teammates Montrezl Harrell, Patrick Beverley and Lou Williams have all left the bubble at some point. The Clippers are widely expected to contend for the title, but will they have the same chemistry that they had before the season was interrupted? And how often will they be fully healthy? GBThis whole pseudo-season is going to be one big basketball experiment, considering it’s all taking place in a single location with at least four and sometimes as many as seven games per day. I’m interested in what sort of effect the lack of a home-court advantage will have on how the postseason plays out. Will lower-seeded underdogs have a slightly better chance? Will it end up even mattering in the slightest? HFFor me, it’s the prospect of watching rookie Zion Williamson blossom from a promising No 1 draft pick into a grown-ass man before our eyes as he attempts to carry the Pelicans into the playoffs after missing the first 44 games of the season while rehabbing from arthroscopic knee surgery. New Orleans may need to win out in order to overtake the Memphis Grizzlies and Portland Trail Blazers for the eighth seed in the West. But Williamson, who turns 21 next week, couldn’t have asked for a more favorable schedule with six of eight games against sub-.500 opponents. BAGIf LeBron James can help turn the ever-unpredictable JR Smith and Dion Waiters into significant playoff contributors, then that will be an incredible surprise. GBThe threat of positive coronavirus tests and the increased likelihood of injuries coming off the break means this: a player you haven’t thought about in years is going to make a gigantic impact for his team. This is a perfect time for a fringe journeyman, a veteran who hasn’t been fantasy-relevant since 2014 or a supposed draft bust to emerge as a difference-maker in this shortened season. HFThe talent-stacked, injury-dogged Philadelphia 76ers were 29-2 at the Wells Fargo Center before the shutdown – the best home record in the NBA – and a lackluster 10-24 on the road. They won’t have any home games in the Orlando bubble, but they won’t be play any true road contests either. With Joel Embiid refreshed and Ben Simmons moving to power forward, Brett Brown’s bipolar bunch will finally realize the potential they’ve heretofore only shown in tantalizing flashes. BAGThe Toronto Raptors had no reported coronavirus cases and have no significant injuries entering the restart. With the star turn of Pascal Siakam complementing the dependable contributions of Kyle Lowry, Marc Gasol and Fred VanVleet, the defending champions are well positioned to make another deep run. GBThe Los Angeles Lakers. If 2020 hadn’t gone 2020 on all of us, the chances were good that the Lakers would have used the regular season to give LeBron James some time off to preserve him for the playoffs. Well, there’s no need to anymore, as Covid-19 has provided it for him. That’s probably bad news for the rest of the West, because he was already playing like an MVP before the shutdown. HFOther teams may have gained more in terms of getting wounded players healthy than the LA Lakers, who were cruising with the best record in the Western Conference when the season was suspended. But a four-and-a-half-month break on the doorstep of the playoffs (and a shortened season overall) is a dream scenario for 35-year-old LeBron James, who for years has sought to conserve his energy for the playoffs wherever possible. Same for the team’s other aging contributors like Danny Green and Dwight Howard. With a number of principals heading toward free agency in the summer (er, fall), this could be the Lakers’ best chance at a title. BAG1010, relatively speaking. Compared to Major League Baseball’s disastrous plan, it’s been a perfect score. Restarting sports anywhere in the United States is a wild gamble given the national infection rates, and it seems that a rigorously enforced bubble is the only way to make it happen. The most questionable decision thus far is the lenient 10-day quarantine punishment for Clippers guard Lou Williams, who was discovered to have visited an Atlanta strip club on an excused absence for a family member’s funeral. GB510. I’m of two minds about this: I personally believe they shouldn’t be playing these games at all, so I’m tempted to give the NBA a one. That said, this is probably the best scenario that they could have drawn up to keep playing, so with that it mind it would be a 10. Let’s do the Solomon thing and split this ranking right down the middle. We’ll give them a five and hope that the bubble doesn’t burst. HF810. It’s a grim state of affairs when a private company, thanks to a shocking abdication of leadership by the federal government, is left to take the lead in the national response to a global pandemic. Lest we forget: it was Adam Silver’s decision to abruptly shut down the season that served as the come-to-Jesus moment for so much of the general US population amid the early denials and prevarications by America’s worst wartime president since Madison. Helped by the relatively scaled-down mechanics of its sport and the ample resources of Disney (the parent company of rights holders ABC and ESPN), the NBA was first to go public with the isolated campus blueprint that’s been successfully implemented by the National Women’s Soccer League. Armchair chaoticians will argue the Lou Williams imbroglio (and the handful of other hiccups like it) are proof of the unavoidable dangers posed by the human element. But if the show must go on, the NBA appears to have struck on the safest path forward. BAGThe Dallas Mavericks will shock whomever they play in the first round of the playoffs. Luka Dončić and Kristaps Porziņģis weren’t simply headlining the league’s No 1 offense before the shutdown they were leading the most efficient offense in NBA history (at 116.7 points per 100 possessions) according to basketball-reference. Rick Carlisle’s team is a bit undermanned entering the restart (regulars Jalen Brunson and Dwight Powell are out for the season), but Dončić and Porziņģis are becoming one of the most formidable duos in the NBA. GBWhat the heck: Let’s just say that the New Orleans Pelicans make the postseason. Sure, this means they would have to leapfrog the Grizzlies and Blazers with just eight games to play, but it would be a fun all-around story to see Zion Williamson make the playoffs (and would vindicate this entire restart structure). HFLA’s longtime afterthoughts won the offseason by adding two superstar wing players in Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, becoming overnight title contenders with the best summer for any NBA team since the Miami Heat signed Chris Bosh and LeBron James in 2010. But after injuries kept them from playing at full strength for most of the pre-lockdown season, the Clippers have been shorthanded for much of their time in Orlando with Patrick Beverley, Montrezl Harrell, Landry Shamet, Lou Williams and Ivica Zubac all outside the bubble for various reasons. Chemistry issues will prove their downfall against the high-upside Houston Rockets in the West semis. BAGMilwaukee Bucks 4-3 LA Clippers. This is probably the one shot that Milwaukee has to win a title, and they’re featuring the league’s most exciting superstar (Giannis Antetokounmpo) with arguably the best depth in the league. The Lakers and Clippers will be the betting favorites, but Milwaukee has reinforcements that those teams lack. A first NBA title since 1971 is in the offing. GBLA Lakers 4-2 Milwaukee Bucks. It would just be amusing if, despite all the talk about how unpredictable the restarted NBA season would get, the finals end up featuring the two teams that were on top of their respective conferences before the shutdown. If the bubble holds and the NBA season manages to make it all the way to October, look for LeBron to win a ring with his third different team as he continues his quest to unseat Michael Jordan as the game’s all-time greatest – although his 10-part documentary won’t be quite as much fun. HFLA Lakers 4-1 Philadelphia 76ers. Bubble weirdness breaks in the Lakers’ favor as LeBron and co win the franchise’s 17th title while sidestepping their two most dangerous threats along the way: the Clippers and the Bucks. The world’s best player, complemented by a healthy Anthony Davis, spins yet another postseason masterpiece in a rematch of the 2001 finals that will arrive at a familiar ending.

Already in the opening minutes, the subcommittee chairman, David Cicilline, struck a combative tone, pointing out that the companies dominate their respective spheres and accusing them of stifling competition. The complaints against the tech giants are varied but the overarching criticisms are that they have used their dominant position to quash rivals and overcharge the people and businesses reliant on their services.“Our founders would not bow before a king,” the Rhode Island Democrat said. “Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.”Republican lawmakers at different times in the hearing directed the conversation away from antitrust to allegations of anti-conservative bias on the platforms, accusing the companies of silencing conservative voices and working to undo Donald Trump’s 2016 election win.Google and Facebook took intense heat for their business practices. Cicilline opened the round of questions with allegations from small businesses that Google took over their content and listing on its own pages. CEO Pichai struggled to answer when Cicilline brought up Google taking reviews from Yelp and cross-posting them to its own pages. When Yelp asked Google to stop, Google reportedly threatened to remove Yelp from its search listings entirely. Cicilline called the behavior “economically catastrophic” for other companies online.“The evidence seems very clear to me that as Google became the gateway to the internet, it began to abuse its power,” he said.Zuckerberg faced repeated questions about Facebook’s purchase of Instagram in 2012. Referencing internal documents that revealed Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize it as a competitive threat, congressman Jerry Nadler called the acquisition “ exactly the type of anticompetitive acquisition the antitrust laws were designed to prevent”. Zuckerberg defended the acquisition, arguing Facebook helped Instagram build up its infrastructure and security as it grew rapidly.Zuckerberg and Pichai also received a beating from Republicans, who repeatedly accused the companies of anti-conservative bias. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner asked Zuckerberg why conservatives are “censored” on Facebook, claiming that Donald Trump Jr was removed from the platform for sharing a video containing false information this week. Zuckerberg politely explained to the representative that it was Twitter that limited Trump’s account for posting the video.Bezos faced few questions following his opening statement, perhaps because of a technical difficulty with his video feed. Representative Pramila Jayapal pressed Bezos on whether the company used data from third-party sellers in making sales decisions. In a previous hearing, an Amazon executive denied this under oath and was contradicted by a later news report. Bezos was also asked whether the online giant favored its own products when prioritizing certain shipments during the pandemic. Bezos, the world’s richest man, leaned heavily on his life story in his opening statement, noting that his mother was “a 17-year-old high school student” and his adoptive father is a Cuban immigrant. “Amazon’s success was anything but preordained,” he said before noting that the company had invested $270bn in the US over the last decade and created hundreds of thousands of jobs.Zuckerberg, too, argued Facebook “got here the American way.” “We started with nothing and provided better products that people find valuable. As I understand our laws, companies aren’t bad just because they are big. Many large companies that fail to compete cease to exist,” he said.Cook, the Apple CEO, faced effective questioning from representative Hank Johnson of Georgia, who said the investigation had surfaced concerns that rules governing the App Store review process are not available to the app developers. “The rules are made up as you go and subject to change - and Apple expects developers to go along with the changes or leave the App Store,” Johnson said. “That’s an enormous amount of power.”The hearing comes at a fraught moment for the tech giants with Republican and Democrats both highly critical of their dominance.Donald Trump, who has attacked the tech companies on numerous occasions, weighed in ahead of the hearing: “If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech, which they should have done years ago, I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington, it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years, and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!”Trump’s attacks on tech companies have escalated as Twitter and Facebook have made recent attempts to factcheck the president and remove false statements from his account. Trump has accused Facebook and Twitter of censoring conservative views and launched numerous attacks on Bezos and Amazon. Bezos owns the Washington Post, which has been a persistent critic of his presidency.Republican lawmakers echoed Trump’s frustrations, lamenting the “cancel culture mob” and questioning the platform’s decisions to take down content on hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has praised as a Covid-19 treatment.“I will just cut to the chase: big tech is out to get conservatives,” representative Jim Jordan, a staunch supporter of the president, told the committee.Congress is considering rewriting antitrust laws but new legislation isn’t likely soon."},{"url":null,"title":"you cant just accept it the sporty 80 year old who wont take bladder weakness lying down","story":"As a busy magazine editor, remembering to do pelvic floor exercises wasn’t always the first thing on Wendy James’s mind. Now, aged 80, she explains why she’s making time for them, alongside regular tennis and core-strengthening pilatesThe card dropped through the letterbox just as I was leaving for my regular coaching session at the tennis club. “Welcome to your ninth decade,” it said. I’d just turned 80 and was planning to celebrate by doing a tandem skye for a local charity.I wasn’t shocked by the card’s message (no, really). I was prepared by the good-ageing philosophy of a thoughtful man called Cecil Kellehar who was fourscore years when he wrote for Choice, the lifestyle magazine for over-50s that I edited in the 1990s. Take it as it comes. Don’t rail against it. Have someone to love. Have something to do. Have something to look forward to. Keep fit.The last one’s easy: I’ve played tennis since I was 10 and do so three times a week if I can. I’d even been asked to join an over-75s group playing indoors every week. Covid-19 and the lockdown ended that, as well as something else I was really looking forward to: jumping out of a plane. Meanwhile, I’m in a weekly Zoom choir and we happily sing out to our heart’s content.I’ve got a husband and family (at a distance) to love and I’m always writing (journalists are like that), so that is certainly something to do. Emailing my MP about doing more to erase the inequalities revealed by the pandemic keeps me occupied.“Take it as it comes”, was my dad’s philosophy too. But sometimes you just can’t accept what life throws at you. Incontinence, for instance. Reading Miriam Margolyes’ frank account of hanging on to her pee, I related instinctively. We all know if you laugh for too long you can leak!But why on earth should it happen? Why is it so commonplace? At the end of the 1960s, after I’d had my two daughters, the health visitor encouraged me to do pelvic floor exercises daily. But I was a full-time working mother with a mortgage, and life went at such a speed that I never paid enough attention to my own body. When my son arrived in the mid 1970s, living pace was even faster – and tennis was put on hold.By the mid 1980s, I was back on the court, expending energy and eradicating angst built up from working long hours on women’s magazines. Fashion, beauty makeovers and diets, Princess Diana and Fergie, royal gardens and fabulous knitting patterns kept me occupied. It was a strange time. My periods were all over the place, as were my emotions – and I was putting on weight.It’s marvellous that we talk freely about women’s health today and it’s easier to find a sympathetic ear and a wealth of options to deal with oestrogen deficiency and menstrual problems. My heart went out to British tennis player Heather Watson whose performance in an important tournament was affected by the time of the month. Now you can avoid periods entirely if you want, with no ill effects – certainly no red or wet patches on tennis whites.My solution was twice-yearly HRT implants, which kept me stable until the 1990s, when I unexpectedly started leaking urine. My GP said my bladder had prolapsed, dropped down into my vagina, so I began doing pelvic floor exercises with a vengeance. I was inspired by Diana Moran, the Green Goddess, who created a range of keep-fit exercises for Choice. She made it all look so easy!At 60, I retired, just after the second of my older sisters died of ovarian cancer. Fearing this would be my fate, too, I used some pension money to go private to remove my womb and ovaries – and had a bladder “lift”. Fortunately, it didn’t involve the mesh, which has been devastating for many and is now banned. Mine was just a stitch, my surgeon said.For 10 years, every Saturday morning I attended a pilates class – our lovely instructor Lidia helped us focus on strengthening the core: making the abdomen and back muscles stronger helps your pelvic floor muscles to control the bladder. We lay on our backs, breathing deeply in and out as we lowered first one leg then the other to the side, eight to 10 times.I kick myself that I didn’t continue with pilates after we moved to the country. The wee problems recurred and I was back to wearing pads. Things improved a little when my GP suspected vaginal atrophy – caused by lack of oestrogen – and prescribed Vagifem, oestradiol tablets inserted like a pessary.Despite all this, I found I still often make an urgent dash for the loo. As a consumer journalist for more than 45 years, I’m always looking for ways to make things better. Panties with integral pads are useful, as accidents are contained. I bought a Kegel8 Ultra 20 electronic pelvic toner, a device with a spoon-like object that goes into the vagina. It was difficult to lie down for half an hour a day with this in place, and I discovered the prolapse was back. This doesn’t happen to everyone, I hasten to say.Then I read about Finnish Innovotherapy, a non-invasive training method using specially designed shorts and electrodes to generate contractions of the muscles. Five days a week, 30 minutes a day over 12 weeks certainly improved my awareness of my pelvic floor and the leaking lessened. It was a costly remedy: I bought it over six months, interest free. It may not be a realistic option for everyone – and you still have to do exercises.One thing I’ve learned about myself is that I need to be given instructions, and having downloaded MyPFF app onto my iPad I squeeze and breathe to order. And there’s new hope: I came across Alex Miller, a Canadian fitness trainer, who believes she has found why our pelvic floor muscles lose their ability to work properly. As we age, we slump! Do you notice yourself hunching over – when you’re using a laptop, driving, sitting at the table or in an armchair. Instead of being upright, our head and chin go forward, as does the abdomen. Raise your shoulders and chin, bring your head back and your body is properly aligned.Her combination of pilates and yoga exercises have shown me the error of my ways. I sit up straight, hold my tummy muscles in, breathing deeply in and out, and try to remember to use MyPFF app every day. When Covid-19 is gone, I’ll be ready to jump out of the plane – wearing a parachute, and hopefully no pad!As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It’s flattish, and gives an insight into the mining history of the county – the tramway used to provide the mines their transport route to the sea. You can see the old mines scattered across the landscape as you pedal along. Park at Portreath and stop off at the Hub bike shop and cafe for picnic supplies (or a puncture repair kit). If 22 miles is too far, park at Bissoe and enjoy a circular ride.RachelThe Family Cycle Trail in the Forest of Dean is a gentle meander through this ancient hunting forest. The path is an old railway route from the area’s mining days. History enthusiasts can visit heritage sites on the way, but those just along for the views and the wildlife won’t be disappointed. Look out for wild boar (the largest population in England) and pine martens as you cycle. Stop off for lunch at one of the numerous picnic spots along the way. It’s circular, fully waymarked and suitable for the whole family, including the dog. Melissa LeeFor the millions of us living in the south-east of the capital, the Sustrans Waterlink Way is a hidden treasure. I pick up the track under the Docklands Light Railway bridge at Deptford (the route starts at nearby Greenwich) and enjoy the pleasant, flat and traffic-free six miles along pretty rivers and through local parks. You’ll finish in Beckenham, where David Bowie played early gigs. Book a swim at the now re-opened Beckenham Place Park  lake and bring a picnic to have in the area’s biggest green space before starting the return leg. A great option for a mini-adventure in the city.Lucy AtkinsonWe love the Marriott’s Way, which follows the route of a disused trainline between Norwich and the Bure Valley in Aylsham. It’s 26 miles of footpath and cycleway, with lots of wildlife and local history. You can access it in central Norwich, and there are exits to visit villages and pubs along the way. The first eight miles is paved, making it easy for children after that there are tracks interspersing the paved paths and fields. It’s so beautiful in summer: you could be cycling in rural France! It has handy mile markers all the way along so you can keep track of distance.Amanda CashWe never tire of the Wirral Circular Trail, a former railway line connecting West Kirby to Chester. It’s safe, flat and with cafe and park stops aplenty. Take in the views of north Wales and Dee estuary, have a breather on the beach at Calday or Thurstaston, stop off at Parkgate for award-winning ice-cream at Nicholls, then continue on through the birdlife haven of (recently reopened) Burton Marshes and cross the border into Cheshire and on to the Chester Greenway. Alternatively, follow the inland route at Neston to Willaston for eats and refreshments at Pollard’s Inn. Both West Kirby and Chester have regular direct trains to Liverpool.Matt LuntThis article was corrected on Friday 30 July.

Lowered his mask. And boomed into a microphone over the hum of car engines. “I now confirm that you, the 2020 Holmes County Central high school class, are completers of high school in the great state of Mississippi. Congratulations to my graduates,” he said.A muted round of applause seemed to evaporate into the open air, before Pomp and Circumstance blasted over the loudspeakers to a near-empty parking lot.“We had to give them something, because they have lost so much,” Henderson said. “Giving them the opportunity to walk across that stage. For their parents to see them walk, it’s just the ultimate, right?”Among Holmes county’s class of 2020 were aspiring business people, doctors and surgeons, accountants, sports therapists, scientists and writers. Each was graduating into a time of economic and political uncertainty, just days before the country erupted into mass protest following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Although personal tragedy had marked some of their childhoods, every student spoke with clarity about their vision of the future.“Today is different from how I imagined it because not all my family can come to support me. I have my mom, my two sisters and my girlfriend. My dad called me last night to tell me how proud he was, because he wasn’t in my life like he should have been. My grandaddy just recovered from Covid so he’s watching online. My best memory of high school is catching an interception during a football game against Cleveland Central this year. I worked so hard for that moment. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety, but I push myself so hard to make everyone proud. I’m going to Northeast Community college, and my dream is to play football professionally. But if my dream is not what God has planned, I want to be a physical therapist.”“Finishing school during the pandemic was hard, because where I live we really don’t have internet service. I had to sit by a window and try to get signal, to get all my work together and have a chance to graduate.They cancelled prom because of the pandemic, and I was just really sad because I never got to experience it and pick out a dress.I want to show my mom that the daughter she raised, the person I became, made all her work worth it. She did it for a reason. I’m planning on joining the army reserves, I want to branch out and see the world.”“I consider the class of 2020 to be possibly the strongest class in history. It’s been so different for us to go through all of this and still be successful.I spent two days writing my salutatorian speech to make sure it came from my heart. I told my class to stay focused, keep a tunnel vision on your dreams and let there be no limitations on you.This year’s valedictorian, Issac Randle Jr, delivered a speech urging his class to “live life and not let life live you”. His parents watched on from a parked red pickup truck, decorated with the words: “Quarantine couldn’t hold me I’m free at last.”They cheered as Randle was the first to pick up his diploma, a broad smile across his face. He will attend the University of Mississippi to study accounting under a grant and a scholarship.“He stayed the course,” said his mother Matilda. “And knowing that his hard work paid off. It just feels incredible.” The Randles planned to celebrate at home with a large family meal.Matilda Randle was far from the only proud parent that morning sitting quarantined inside their vehicle. Christine Baker, who had recently been furloughed from her job at a local car factory due to the pandemic, wore a T-shirt with her daughter Ma’Kiyah’s picture printed on it. She had raised her as a single parent.“I thanked God for allowing me to watch her walk that stage,” Baker said, tears in her eyes. “It meant everything to me. I went beyond and beneath, and put my life on the back burner to raise her.”The school district is preparing for a return to lessons next month. But as Covid-19 cases in the county surged over the summer and parents voiced their reluctance to send children back in person, there will be only online classes for high school students this term.Henderson watched in horror from Holmes county as Donald Trump thrust the issue of school return into the ongoing culture wars during the pandemic.“It seems like the federal government only cares about themselves and no one else. That the economy is more important to him than human beings,” he said. “But we here are taking care of ourselves.”Amber: “I’m going to Coahoma Community college this fall to study criminal justice. I want to be a lawyer. I see what’s going on in my community and there’s a lot of people getting charged unfairly. I want to be able to help those people.”“My fondest memory of high school will always be going with my classmates on field trips to experience different things out there in the world.I’m planning to go to college and study cosmetology. I want to open my own hair and nail salon, but I want to do it outside of Mississippi. I want to see something other than this state.”“There’s a lot of people dying and suffering right now, and I would love to be a part of the help. I’m going to Texas Southern University to study biology and then I want to train to become an anesthesiologist.It’s a dream I’ve had since middle school, watching Grey’s Anatomy and being interested in the simple jobs, besides the doctors and nurses, that people don’t really recognize.But tonight I’m just going to celebrate with family and have a cookout.”A number of Holmes County Central students were grappling with the loss of close family in recent years. The county has the 11th-lowest average life expectancy in the United States, at 71 years, which is seven and a half years below the national average.Tony Christopher Jr’s father passed away in February 2017 after a brief hospitalization. “They didn’t tell us too much about it, I just woke up one day and they told us he was in the hospital,” Christopher said, an image of his father printed on his graduation stole. “I just know he’d be very proud of me graduating because it’s something he didn’t do.”Mercedes Black lost her aunt to illness in April 2019. “If it wasn’t for her I wouldn’t have made it this far,” Black said, an image of her aunt adorning her graduation cap that was decorated in flowers. “When I was struggling in school she would help, she always told me to never give up. All she told me was that she wanted to see me graduate and walk that stage, and I just hate that she couldn’t be here to see us. She was like my second mom.”For a moment the ceremony dispensed with social distancing as Tamia Anderson took to the stage. As she collected her diploma, Henderson offered her a split-second hug as her great grandmother Roosevelt Anderson and grandmother Janice Harper screamed with joy from their car: “That’s my baby! You go girl!”In June 2018 Tamia’s mother took her own life. The aftermath was laced with trauma.“I didn’t really deal with it how I should have,” Anderson said. “I bottled up my emotions and it ended up turning into anger.”She was almost moved to an alternative school, but took time out for counseling and was allowed to return after a hearing. Tamia graduated almost at the top of her class.The Anderson family moved to Mississippi from Chicago 20 years ago after all three of Roosevelt’s sons were killed in the city, leaving Janice the only child still alive.“I moved here to get away from Chicago,” Roosevelt said. “I wanted to find a place where the family could always come for peace and rest.”The tragedy of the suicide compounded generations of grief. Tamia thought of her mother as she collected her diploma.“She’s smiling so hard right now, I can feel it all over me,” she said as she exited the stage. The family returned home straight after, to a residence in the hills outside Lexington with manicured lawns, blooming flowers and a horse grazing in a small field.Tamia walked to her mother’s grave in a plot by the house, and reflected on the completion of her high school education.“It means so much to me,” she said of the ability to graduate in person. “You have no idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7a485ff2820dd4053e1b8185bd5cdf176b333a6/0_0_4500_4500/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d4cc07e39689ad8475135b556fd9e13c 1240w","title":"joe biden pick running mate democrats name favorites","story":"Kamala Harris? Val Demings? Democrats speculate but no single candidate will be able to satisfy all the interest groups and sectors of the partyIt doesn’t matter who Joe Biden picks as his running mate – somebody will be disappointed.The former vice-president and de facto Democratic presidential nominee on Tuesday said he would make a selection in the first week of August.The selection process has largely been kept secret with as many as two dozen names floating around as potential running mates.Vice-presidential nominees rarely decide elections and the common rule among political operatives is that a candidate should pick someone who does no harm. But in the 2020 presidential cycle, Biden’s selection has added importance. If he wins the 2020 presidential election, Biden has indicated that he may not run for re-election, immediately putting his vice-president into contention for 2024.Biden’s public criteria for the role are that it be someone he feels “simpatico” with, and it be a woman. He recently said there were “four Black women” he was considering picking. Democrats close to Biden’s inner circle believe Biden has narrowed his pool down to about six names but he is still very much undecided.But among the many candidates mentioned by Biden himself, or anonymous Democratic operatives in articles gaming out his choices, or pundits, there is no single person who would satisfy all the interest groups and sectors of the Democratic party, each of which has its favorites.Democrats hoping to elevate someone with law enforcement credentials would like to see the Florida congresswoman Val Demings, a former chief of the Orlando police department.But progressives and their affiliated groups have pushed for someone like the Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams or Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.“The campaign needs to show progressives across this country that he recognizes that the future of the party is with progressives and the only way to do that is by choosing a really strong progressive to be his vice-presidential candidate,” said Charles Chamberlain, the executive director of the progressive Democracy for America outside group.At one point centrists in the party were hoping for the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar before Klobuchar took herself out of the running. Meanwhile, mayors across the country would like to see one of their own get the nod – someone like Atlanta’s Keisha Lance Bottoms.Democrats who think executive experience and a history of winning statewide elections want someone like the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, or the New Mexico governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. Others who think a military background would help Biden oust Donald Trump have pushed for the Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth.And in recent days the former Obama administration national security adviser Susan Rice has been a hot topic of political articles about Biden’s potential running mate.But no single candidate fits the bill for everyone.The Abrams team have been aggressive in putting forward her candidacy. They eagerly set up interviews with reporters and Abrams surrogates like Warren. Abrams has also appeared at multiple fundraising events for Biden.Other groups have also been active in support of their choices. The Democratic veterans group VoteVets have released ads pushing for Duckworth.“Tammy was kind of the only veteran out there that they were looking at,” said Jon Soltz, the chairman of VoteVets. “The point of what we were trying to do was show what that would look like and that she should be considered.”Mayors across the country enjoy a tight community. One of the more prominent mayors, Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, is on the committee charged with helping Biden make his pick. His counterparts in other cities have expressed their support for Bottoms or Demings.“The Florida mayors particularly have been pushing for Demings,” said the maor of Dayton, Ohio, Nan Whaley. “We have Keisha in the mix too which we’re excited about as a mayor.”It’s possible Biden will infuriate varying sectors of the Democratic party depending on who he picks. If he picks a Caucasian women, Biden risks disappointing the African American community. If Biden picks a centrist he could disappoint the progressive wing of the party and depress turnout among activists in that wing. If Biden picks a progressive, he might turn off moderates and Republicans the campaign and its allies have been working to woo.If he picks a member of Congress, that could give pause to voters eager to see an executive join the former vice-president. A recent poll conducted for the liberal thinktank Data for Progress found that independent voters want Biden to put an emphasis on “governing effectiveness” in picking a running mate.And if he picks someone like Rice or Abrams, that could worry Democrats who think Biden’s running mate needs a record of winning elections statewide. Neither Abrams or Rice have ever won elections statewide. And Rice has never run a federal campaign, although she took a serious look about challenging the Republican senator Susan Collins in Maine.In recent days a set of donors have warned Biden against picking Harris, according to a CNBC report. But Biden’s peril only extends so far. More so than in past cycles, Democrats across the party say they just want to see Biden beat Trump.“I would say that if Biden picks someone besides Tammy Duckworth we’re still going to enthusiastically attack Donald Trump,” Soltz said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816dbe7055fa60a2f4b5d4cd980a736c4021867d/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57a3a7e37c0a533b305dfedf9d5e18d8","title":"uk signs deal for fourth potential coronavirus vaccine","story":"Britain takes its stockpile to 250m doses after most recent agreementFour potential Covid-19 vaccines have been secured so far by the UK, which aims to buy up to 12 to ensure that the country has one or more that work as soon as possible. They are:The government has a deal for 100m doses of the adenovector potential vaccine, which uses an adenovirus responsible for an infection in chimps, similar to the common cold, to get into cells and deliver immunity.Britain has bought 30m doses of the vaccine, which has done well in early trials and is designed along similar lines to that being developed by Imperial College London, which has research funding from the government. These vaccines use genetic code rather than killed or attenuated parts of the virus itself. No vaccine developed on this model has yet been licensed.The deal in principle is for 60m doses, with funding to support the French company’s research. It has a factory in Scotland, where it is developing a vaccine based on the killed, whole virus, which is a traditional approach. There is a possibility to extend the deal to 100m doses if the vaccine is successful.The UK government will buy 60m doses if the vaccine is effective in clinical trials, which are scheduled to start in September. The vaccine is based on another traditional approach, using an adjuvant that boosts the immune system to help it fight off the virus. This method holds particular promise for vaccinating older people, because the immune system weakens as years go by."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5783571682f008ed5e337d8e863946e6593fd0eb/0_273_4655_2794/master/4655.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f59b8004b862b4eedaa5b8f481df5e2c","title":"vietnam on high alert coronavirus cases major cities hanoi","story":"First local case in three months reported over the weekend in holiday spot of Da NangVietnam is on high alert and bracing for a rise in coronavirus cases, after local media reported that infections have been detected in the capital, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and the Central Highlands region.The country’s prime minister, Nguyen Xuan Phuc warned on Wednesday that every province and every city was at risk, adding that the new “wave” appeared to be different to that seen in Vietnam earlier this year.Vietnam, which has been praised for its response to the pandemic, reported its first local case for more than three months last weekend, after a man in the central city of Da Nang became ill. Officials have said that the recent infections involve a new strain of the virus that has originated outside of the country, and which seemed to be more virulent.So far, 30 cases of the virus have been detected in or around Da Nang, while two cases have been confirmed in Ho Chi Minh City, and one has been reported in both Hanoi and Central Highlands. There are growing fears that tens of thousands of people holidaying in the coastal city of Da Nang may have transported the virus across the country over recent weeks.“We have to act more swiftly and more fiercely in order to control the outbreak,” the state broadcaster VTV reported Phuc as telling a meeting of government officials. He said tourist hubs throughout the country should increase vigilance.The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”\u0026nbspThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.The government is evacuating 80,000 people from Da Nang, mostly tourists who had been taking advantage of discounted travel deals, who will be required to isolate at home. The city has been placed under strict lockdown, with flights suspended.VTV reported that the cases in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City were linked to the cluster in Da Nang.Life in Vietnam had been returning to normal, with many people no longer wearing face masks and domestic tourism booming, but the country is again on high alert. In Hanoi, authorities are tracing people who may have had close contact with a man who works in a pizza restaurant and who is suspected of having Covid-19. Barriers have been placed near to the man’s home, while the restaurant and local area have been disinfected.In Ho Chi Minh City, a hotel has been locked down and a nearby hospital in Binh Tan district has stopped receiving patients for three days, after two suspected Covid-19 cases emerged.About 18,000 tourists who had been in Da Nang have returned to Ho Chi Minh City, officials said on Tuesday. Hanoi authorities had earlier said they were expecting 15,000 to 20,000 to return from the city.The country responded with speed and agility to the pandemic earlier this year, deploying aggressive contact-tracing systems and quarantine measures – avoiding a major outbreak. Despite sharing a border with China, Vietnam has recorded 446 450 Covid-19 cases, and no fatalities.This figure does not include 140 construction workers infected with Covid-19 who were evacuated from Equatorial Guinea on Wednesday, and who will be treated at a hospital outside Hanoi.The source of the new cases is not clear, though the government has responded with a series of arrests linked to illegal immigration.

It comes as global cases passed 17m, after five of the last seven days saw one-day jumps of more than 250,000 new infections.The 723 new cases announced by the Victorian premier Daniel Andrews marked the 25th consecutive day of triple-digit increases in Australia’s second most populous state. Ten of the 13 deaths are believed to be connected to aged care homes. Australia’s previous deadliest day was Sunday, when 10 people were reported to have died.In response to the record high, Andrews announced that from midnight on Thursday, people living in several regional districts south-west of Melbourne would no longer be allowed any visitors to their homes. Andrews also mandated the wearing of face coverings outside home for the entire state, from this Sunday.In the state of Queensland, meanwhile, two coronavirus-infected Brisbane teenagers who dodged quarantine after returning from Victoria will face court, as the state braces itself for a possible outbreak of community transmission.

About 800 million children and young people under the age of 19 are likely to have blood levels of lead at or above 5 micrograms per decilitre (5μgdl), according to the report. There is no safe level for lead exposure, according to the World Health Organization, but levels above 5μgdl are regarded by the US Centers for Disease Control as a cause for action.

It does our economy no good if corruption and illicit funding is allowed to go unchallenged.”West said the report raised questions about the Conservatives’ failure to crack down on money laundering. “The Tories have had 10 years to sort out tax havens in British jurisdictions, but there are concerns that funding from Russian donors to Johnson’s Tory party coffers could be holding them back.”In its response to the Russia report, the government said it was clear that tackling illicit finance and driving dirty money and money launderers out of the UK was a priority. “We are not complacent and we will ensure the full weight of law enforcement bears down on dirty money,” it said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/118eebefa76291893fc338aca184350b76cb7bec/0_0_4893_2937/master/4893.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8c48a609c8f984e984c088e16ed20e2","title":"scaled down hajj begins in coronavirus era in pictures","story":"Attendance limited to 10,000 people already residing in Saudi Arabia, rather than the usual 2 million including from abroad, amid Covid-19 restrictions"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89afd07ee3910aa60deaeb6d9ff9a2326ef74761/0_137_4104_2462/master/4104.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=130d1efe595df66046b5a28e65c74bee","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates isolation period","story":"Government looking at raising period from seven to 10 days amid rise in Covid-19 casesThe chart shows excess death rates until the end of May. Madrid had the overall largest number of excess deaths.England suffered the worst excess deaths rate of any nation in Europe in the first wave of the coronavirus, according to new data which shows the impact of the virus across the continent.The data, which allow comparisons between 29 European countries - treating the four nations of the UK nations separately - shows that, while England did not have the highest peak mortality, it did have the longest continuous period of excess mortality of any country compared.The figures indicate that the excess death toll in Spain was even deeper than indicated in previously published data. Here are more of the key findings in the ONS report on excess deaths in Europe.The four chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have just issued a joint statement confirming that people with coronavirus symptoms are now being advised to self-isolate for 10 days, not just seven days. Here is the statement in full.In symptomatic people Covid-19 is most infectious just before, and for the first few days after symptoms begin. It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with Covid-19 who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between 7 and 9 days after illness onset.We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from 7 to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.Here are two of the key charts from the ONS report into excess deaths in Europe in the first half of 2020.And this chart shows excess death figures for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.This is from Edwin Morgan, from the health analysis and life events ision at the ONS, commenting on today’s ONS report on excess deaths. (See 9.37am.) Morgan said:Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the first half of 2020 saw extraordinary increases in mortality rates across countries in Western Europe above the 2015 to 2019 average.While none of the four UK nations had a peak mortality level as high as Spain or the worst-hit local areas of Spain and Italy, excess mortality was geographically widespread throughout the UK during the pandemic, whereas it was more geographically localised in most countries of Western Europe.Combined with the relatively slow downward ‘tail’ of the pandemic in the UK, this meant that by the end of May, England had seen the highest overall relative excess mortality out of all the European countries compared.The Office of National Statistics has just published its report on excess deaths in Europe in the first six months of 2020. And it says England had “the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe for the period as a whole”.This is significant because government scientists have repeatedly said excess deaths are the best measure of impact of coronavirus on a country, because coronavirus death figures are not counted in the same way in different places, and those headline figures do not include other people who have died as a consequence of the crisis.While England did not have the highest peak mortality, it did have the longest continuous period of excess mortality of any country compared, resulting in England having the highest levels of excess mortality in Europe for the period as a whole.We will post more on this shortly.Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, joining the blog for the day.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: The Office for National Statistics is due to publish a report on all-cause mortality across European nations. It is also publishing a report on the economic impact of coronavirus.11am: Liu Xiaoming, the Chinese ambassador, is due to hold a press conference on China-UK relations.11.15am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, delivers a speech on the future of healthcare.12pm: The government is expect to confirm that people with symptoms of coronavirus may be asked to isolate for an extra three days.12.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, makes a statement to the Scottish parliament on the next steps in the easing of the lockdown. She is expected to confirm that pupils will return to school in Scotland in August.Matt Hancock: second wave of coronavirus is starting to roll across Europe – videoThe health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the “big scientific challenge” with testing people at the border was that you “can incubate this disease for many days without displaying any symptoms, and that wouldn’t show up in a test”, PA Media reports.So if people get off a plane coming from somewhere that has a high degree of disease and therefore they have to quarantine, if you get the test, and the test result comes back negative, you could still have the disease, you’re just incubating it.Mr Hancock said he was not against testing people at the border but more work was needed on the timing of Covid-19 tests to make them effective.Ministers should consider enshrining in law a right to food and must appoint a new minister for food security, according to an influential committee of MPs, after the coronavirus pandemic exposed serious problems with the government’s handling of the food system in a crisis.A second wave of Covid-19 could sharply increase the number of people at risk of food shortages and hunger, which already stands at 6.6 million, including 1.7 million children, the report by the environment, food and rural affairs select committee found.Panic buying – which was often just consumers responding to the need to eat all meals at home – and shortages of some staples in the shops, characterised the start of the Covid-19 crisis after the government failed to communicate properly with the public and the food industry, the MPs on the environment, food and rural affairs committee found in a new report.The government “appeared unprepared” for the impact of the closure of restaurants and cafes, they said, and was too slow to provide guidance for workers in the food supply sector.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has warned that a “second wave” of coronavirus is “starting to roll across Europe”, according to a write-up by PA Media.I am worried about a second wave. I think you can see a second wave starting to roll across Europe and we’ve got to do everything we can to prevent it from reaching these shores and to tackle it.The measures that the chief medical officer will set out later are part of that but so too are the measures we’re taking, for instance to ensure that we don’t directly bring cases back to this country where there’s a big spike in cases.So absolutely on a second wave it is something I worry about and I worry about it because we can see it happening.Hancock has been doing the media rounds this morning. He said ministers were investigating ways to reduce the 14-day quarantine period for new arrivals to the UK from at-risk countries when it was safe to do so.We’re always looking at how we can have the least-possible burden of the measures that we have to put into place so that is something on which we’re doing some work but we’ll only come forward with a proposal when we’re confident that it is safe to do so.So again this is very much guided by the clinical science and the CMO (chief medical officer) will be speaking on it later today, but the broader point is that there’s a serious concern about a second wave that’s clearly now moving across Europe and we need to take action.If that means increasing the number of days that people who test positive have to self-isolate then so be it because these measures are necessary to keep people safe.People with coronavirus symptoms may be asked to isolate for a total of 10 days, three days more than currently advised, after government scientists raised concern about a steady rise in the number of cases in the UK. understands that the government is looking at increasing the isolation period for those who have symptoms from seven to 10 days in line with the developing science on the virus’s incubation period and how long it remains contagious.The UK’s government’s official dashboard showed 83 Covid-19 associated deaths and 763 newly lab-confirmed infections on Wednesday, and there appears to have been a slight rise in infections as lockdown restrictions have eased.Niall Dickson, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS leaders, told MPs that NHS managers were very worried about a second wave. He said: I would say in relation to the second spike issue or something coming, the levels of concern among our members – the people who are leading NHS trusts, who are leading in primary care and all levels in the systems – is very high.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has also hinted that the length of time people with coronavirus symptoms must self-isolate for will be increased to 10 days in England, PA reports.This is a decision that’s clinically led. The chief medical officer will be setting out details later today.I can’t steal his thunder but what I will say is we will always do what is necessary to protect people and we’re guided by the clinical judgment, by the science in this.I’ll be on the liveblog for the next few hours.

Photograph: Getty ImagesThere was a drop in alcohol consumption during the second quarter of 2020, compared to the same period last year. Figures from the Revenue Commissioners show an overall decline of 7.7 per cent when compared to the equivalent April, May and June period in 2019. The most dramatic fall came in the beer category, with consumption down by 17.4 per cent. Spirits are down by almost 10 per cent, while cider declined by 9.4 per cent. Wine was the only category to show an increase in consumption, with a 10 per cent rise on the same quarter last year. Rosemary Garth, chairwoman of the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland, said the figures confirm “the dramatic impact the pandemic has had on the hospitality sector”. “For the 210,000 people who depend on pubs, hotels, restaurants and manufacturers for their livelihoods, the implication is stark,” she said. “As it stands, over half of the country’s pubs remain closed. For those who have reopened, they are doing so at capacity levels which are half of what they had pre Covid-19. Even if guidelines change, we anticipate the second half of the year will see a reduction in sales by as much as 50 per cent in the sector. We estimate that over 20,000 jobs are vulnerable.” Ms Garth said the July Stimulus plan unveiled last week “was a start, but it is a long road back”. “We need to think and act fast, not least on measures like taxation which can have an immediate impact,” she added. “Reducing excessively high excises taxes on alcohol is one such measure and October’s budget is the time for such a reduction. We need to recover and protect these community businesses who are up against it for the long-term.”The Licenced Vintners’ Association meanwhile has claimed the extended closure as a result of Covid-19 will see at least 2,500 permanent redundancies and the closure of 10 pubs in Dublin. The LVA said one-in-five jobs in the pub sector will be lost as a result of the closure of all licenced premises since March 15th. The LVA has indicated there may also be further significant job losses ahead, with almost one in three Dublin pubs yet to reopen and any pubs that do open operating at 50 per cent capacity or less. The association has warned that there will be further redundancies as many city centre pubs are struggling because of the absence of office workers, tourists and restrictions on public transport. To date three pubs have publicly announced that they will not be reopening - the Queens in Dalkey, The Donaghmede Inn in Donaghmede and The Cardiff Inn, Finglas. LVA chief executive Donall O’Keeffe said the seven other pub owners had informed them privately that they do not intend to open their doors on August 10th.

The outgoing government argued Simon Coveney should keep his official ministerial car after stepping down as tánaiste because of his frequent visits to Northern Ireland as Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr Coveney travelled by car to the North 44 times in 2019 and while the number of trips will be less frequent this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Government sources said he travelled across the Border (mostly to Belfast) at least once – and sometimes twice – when the Dáil was in session.It is understood that Mr Coveney himself made no request, formal or informal, to retain the car.Outgoing taoiseach Leo Varadkar asked Government Secretary General Martin Fraser to contact the Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Aidan O’Driscoll, to inquire about retaining the State car. The Government is struggling to the finish line of a tumultuous Dáil term as it emerged on Wednesday that the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach had approached his counterpart in the Department of Justice and asked him to contact the Garda Commissioner about a security detail for the former tánaiste. Under a 2011 agreement, Garda drivers are usually made available only to the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Justice. In the Dáil on Wednesday Labour leader Alan Kelly claimed Mr Coveney was using a State car and Garda drivers “without permission” because no Cabinet decision was made to approve the move. He said a Minister going around in a Garda car “costing €200,000 a year without permission” raised “serious questions”.Garda vehicleBefore he became tánaiste Mr Coveney used his own car with civilian drivers. However, whenever he crossed the Border, he was required to change to an unmarked Garda vehicle driven by a Garda driver, which was then escorted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland to his destination. Given the frequency of his travel to the North, it was argued that the practice of using his own car and swapping cars at the Border would not result in significant savings. Moreover, it would also have security implications, said the sources. Separately, on Wednesday a review by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection determined that 85 out of the 2,500 who had their pandemic unemployment payment stopped for leaving the country may in fact be entitled to it. The department said it would be contacting each of these iniduals in the coming days. The Government U-turned and said it would continue the payment for those who travelled to green list countries. Several sources insisted that Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys’ decision to change tack had been communicated to the Taoiseach, Micheál Martin, beforehand. However, the fallout from the controversy continued.

It predicted a third of all pubs in the capital could go.Three Dublin pubs have publicly announced that they will not be reopening – the Queens in Dalkey, The Donaghmede Inn in Donaghmede, and The Cardiff Inn, Finglas. LVA chief executive Donall O’Keeffe said seven others have privately said that they are finished, adding that the pubs that do reopen will have to operate at 50 per cent capacity or less. He said Covid-19 has been the “straw that broke the camel’s back” since many pubs in the capital were already struggling with high rents. Rural pubs could be even worse off.LVA president Ronan Hughes, who owns the Swan pub in Aungier Street, said publicans were in “very pessimistic mood”. City-centre pubs were struggling badly, while those in the suburbs “seem to be doing a bit better”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4309990.1595345270!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pity the expert in these sceptical times","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tToo often good science is countered by ignorance.  This is evident in the US, where objectivity has become a matter of opinion. The plight of the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci is the prime illustration of this. Photograph: Leah MillisReuters These are hard times for experts notably scientists and doctors who believe data (and their interpretation of it) should be allowed speak for itself and, where appropriate, prompt a response in the best interests of the human race or the world we live in. For those working on Covid-19 and climate change it can be particularly rough terrain.Global authorities in their field of endeavour should not be dismissed so easily, especially those with a record of fashioning effective responses to global crises such as AIDS, Ebola or an overheating planet – or who have added greatly to fundamental knowledge.Too often good science is countered by vitriol accusations of lack of independence and instant condemnation with “yes but...” from non-experts. This is evident in the US, where objectivity has become a matter of opinion. The plight of the federal government’s top infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci is the prime illustration of this.President Donald Trump, an exponent of anti-science, constantly adds to the cauldron of social media tyranny and displays little respect for those with greater knowledge than himself.His trade adviser Peter Navarro recently declared Fauci was “wrong about everything” – no doubt doing the bidding of his master a man who has never admitted a single mistake in office.The modern phenomenon goes beyond the US. The Irish environmentalist Prof Terry Hughes, an authority on decline of coral reef systems, highlighted on twitter a photograph of a protester whose placard read: “At the start of every disaster movie there is a scientist being ignored” – and added “I have a lot of friends who can relate to this.”This is everyday reality and complicating matters are pigheaded populist leaders, as illustrated this month when UK prime minister Boris Johnson indicated in parliament he had not read a Government-commissioned report warning of a second coronavirus wave next winter which could cost 120,000 lives. He then insisted unconvincingly he was aware of it.Fortunately science has a more prominent position within Irish society. There is widespread recognition of its merits while scientists engender a high level of trust. Strategic investment in a knowledge-based economy has helped. The response to the emerging pandemic, where the public heeded the recommendations of National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET), is proof of this.Were it always so easy.“When you mix science and politics, you get politics,” according to John M Barry author of The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History. With the coronavirus, the US has proved politics hasn’t worked, he believes. So to “fully reopen both the economy and schools safely...we have to return to science”.The dynamic is different in Ireland though resolution is equally difficult to achieve, such is the deviousness of Covid-19. The politicians have to balance what the science is saying, economic consequences and wellbeing.Independent networkThis is typical of modern policy challenges facing governments characterised by a mixture of complexity, uncertainty and ambiguity. That is why there is a compelling case for an independent network of scientific advisers to advise government “on the formidable scientific challenges facing Ireland” as outlined by Royal Irish Academy president Dr Mary Canning.“Policymakers are increasingly confronted with highly complex policy issues requiring multiple forms of knowledge, including scientific insights, experiential knowledge and local perspectives,” she explained.This should be provided by a multi-disciplinary network of specialists in a similar way to NPHET but on a permanent basis. Just look what might be coming down the tracks: a flu pandemic a storm surge driven by a hurricane that heads for Ireland rather than the Caribbean, unprecedented sea level rise caused by melting Arctic ice sheets, and dramatic ageing of our population post 2050.The physicist and science communicator Brian Greene revealed the extent of his concern about the disconnect between specialists and the public when asked by the Financial Times, what is the greatest challenge of our time?He responded: “Many would focus on the most immediate: saving the planet from the devastation wrought by human activity. I’d like to add changing the mindset of the public to recognise that the tools of rational investigation, of science, are available to everyone – and have the capacity not only to radically transform the challenges we face, but also to realise enormous opportunities. The health of democracy requires that every citizen has some familiarity with scientific ideas.”There is much work to do on this front to bring us all to that better – and safer – place."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Australian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph:  Colin KeeganCollinsThe public debate in Ireland since the pandemic struck has revealed a prevalent assumption that travelling outside the island means going on holiday.Apart from being age and class-specific, this belief is deeply off-kilter for a nation with one of the highest proportions of its citizens living abroad in the world. One in six, according to a 2016 assessment, the highest level in the OECD.The equation of overseas travel with holidays, evident in statements by both government and opposition politicians, involves two key flawed assumptions.One is an idea that overseas summer holidays are a universal norm, rather than a luxury enjoyed by some. (The adoption of the term “staycation” to mean a holiday in Ireland, rather than the previously more common meaning of a holiday in your own house, is another illustration. Isn’t the quintessential summer holiday in Wexford? For whom is this a downgrade from a “real” holiday?)The other assumption involves a peculiar blindness to the reality that Irish families and work practices are international.“It’s bizarre . . . There can hardly be a household in the country without someone who can’t get home,” was how the disconnect was described to me by Dr Marc Scully, a lecturer in the psychology department at Mary Immaculate College Limerick who studies migration and the Irish diaspora.Flawed framingCoverage in the Irish media is also culpable for the flawed framing of the issue. As one of the Irish stranded abroad, it was jarring and disconcerting to read news about the government’s travel advice framed as a consumer story, and illustrated with photographs of beaches and headlines lamenting the loss of holidays this summer.The equation of travel with holidays was repeated throughout the furore over the Department of Social Protection’s cancellation of benefit payments to people who were found to be travelling through ports or airports.“If a person chooses to ignore public health advice and go on holidays, they are not just unavailable for work for the duration of their holiday, they are also unavailable for the two-week quarantine period on their return,” Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys said in defence of the practice.This illustrates an assumption that if people are in an airport, they are there for leisure reasons.I’m a 2009 graduate. Airports don’t mean holidays to me. They mean work, and how I see my family.Dr Scully himself lived in Ireland while working in Britain for six months, taking a plane full of weary commuters each week on the red eye from Cork airport.“If this had happened three years ago, I would have been faced with the decision of: do I resign my job, or do I face not seeing my wife and son for six months? I can only imagine there are people who have had to make that decision,” Dr Scully said.“Or people who are caring for family members, who have suddenly had to make the decision of: do I quit my job, or do I suddenly try to sort out the caring responsibilities elsewhere?”“There’s a way of life there that has suddenly stopped,” he observed.Here are some reasons why people can be in an airport. On their way to collect someone from hospital. Going to a job interview. Seeing a solicitor about a will. On the way to hospital themselves.Airport storiesListen to the stories of those who were stopped in Dublin airport by the welfare officers and this is the reality that is reflected.Roman Shortall was stopped before boarding a flight to Romania with his family. Shortall’s wife, now a naturalised Irish citizen, is originally from Romania, and they were going to see a terminally ill relative. Their child benefit payments were stopped.Ciaran Cooney is a guitarist and singer with the Irish Celtic show who is resident in Ireland but earns 70 per cent of his income working abroad. His pandemic unemployment payment was stopped after he was checked boarding a flight to Glasgow to spend nine days with his partner, who he had not seen for 15 weeks. He had no income for six weeks and had to move back in with his parents.“There is no consideration for people who are in relationships with people who live outside the state or those of us who work abroad for a living but were fully tax compliant in Ireland all the time,” he wrote of the incident.To be absolutely clear: this is not a challenge to the government’s advice on travel. It’s an appeal to ground the debate in the reality of what travel means to the Irish population as a whole, and not the subsection that is primarily concerned about overseas holidays.Prior to the pandemic, Dublin to London was one of the busiest air routes in the world. That’s down to work and family ties, not tourism. This mobility is fundamental to how Ireland has operated as a nation since at least the last recession. Let’s axe the assumption that your two-week holiday in Portugal is the overriding issue at stake.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"\u0026lsquoShield of Israel\u0026rsquo plan devised after government\u0026rsquos response to the second wave widely seen as chaoticGrouping of countries looking east called \u0026lsquoaxis of the sanctioned\u0026rsquoKing Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4317654.1596100984!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us federal agents to begin withdrawing from portland after clashes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFederal officers near the US district courthouse in Portland, Oregon, on Tuesday. Photograph: Brandon BellThe New York TimesFederal agents will begin to withdraw from Portland, Oregon, after clashes with protesters drew attention around the world, the US department of homeland security announced on Wednesday.Kate Brown, Oregon’s Democratic governor, said agents would begin a “phased withdrawal”, with the first wave leaving the central area of the city on Thursday.Chad Wolf, acting DHS secretary, said in a statement that the department had negotiated a plan with Ms Brown over the previous 24 hours. There would remain a “robust presence” of Oregon State Police in downtown Portland, Mr Wolf said.“State and local law enforcement will begin securing properties and streets, especially those surrounding federal properties, that have been under nightly attack for the past two months,” Mr Wolf said in a statement. He added that Oregon’s police would co-ordinate with federal officers to “ensure all federal facilities remain protected and secure”.For weeks in downtown Portland, Oregon’s largest city, federal forces have used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators, some of whom have used fireworks and high-powered lasers. President Donald Trump has sent more than 100 DHS and US Marshals Service officers into the city over the objections of local and state leaders.Residents in the majority-white city, which has a reputation for progressive politics and a long tradition of vocal protest, have reacted with outrage to the federal officers.Barr defenceOn Tuesday William Barr, US attorney-general, defended the actions of the Trump administration in Portland during an appearance before the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives judiciary committee, denouncing the demonstrations at US northwest city’s federal courthouse as driven by “violent rioters and anarchists”.“Since when is it okay to try and burn down a federal court?” he told the committee. He insisted federal forces deployed to Portland were simply “defending the courthouse. We’re not out looking for trouble.”Mr Trump insisted on Wednesday that federal troops would not leave Portland until local authorities “secured their city”.“We told the governor, we told the mayor: ‘Secure your city.’ If they don’t secure their city soon, we have no choice - we’re going to have to go in and clean it out. We’ll do it very easily. We’re all prepared to do it,” he said.The president later tweeted: “If the federal government and its brilliant law enforcement (Homeland) didn’t go into Portland one week ago, there would be no Portland – it would be burned and beaten to the ground.”Even as the Trump administration moves to reduce its presence in Portland, it announced that it would send federal agents into three more US cities – Detroit, Michigan Cleveland, Ohio and Milwaukee, Wisconsin – as part of an operation to quell what the president has described as a “rampage of violence”.Agents had already been sent to Chicago, to Kansas City, Missouri, and to Albuquerque, New Mexico, as part of that operation.Mr Trump has attempted to portray Democratic-controlled cities as bastions of lawlessness as he pitches himself to voters as the law and order candidate in a tight presidential re-election battle.

Instead, pebbles were collected in bags and sterilised in advance. Hand sanitiser and soap were also in ample supply. All expenses were covered by the Saudi government, including healthcare for anyone who falls ill during the pilgrimage.  Words aren\u0027t enough to explain how blessed I feel and how amazing the arrangements have been, Ammar Khaled, a 29-year-old Saudi resident from India, told the Associated Press. They have taken every possible precaution,” he added. With people based overseas forbidden from joining Hajj, the 1,000 places for Saudi residents were hotly contested.

The monument at Avebury is a Neolithic henge containing three stone circles, around the village of Avebury, Wiltshire.The breakthrough came when a piece of core – drilled from Stonehenge\u0027s Stone 58 during repair work in the 1950s – was returned to English Heritage from the US last year, which gave archaeologists the chance to analyse the chemical make-up without damaging the monument.English Heritage historian Susan Greaney said: The bluestones we\u0027ve known come from mid-west Wales from the 1920s, and they were easy to source because there are inclusions and quartz which you can match to the outcrop. The large stones are pretty uniform and just look like a big block, so it\u0027s difficult to interrogate them and find where they are from. The new research used X-ray spectrometry to look at the very small trace elements, and it was found the Stonehenge sarsens matched those in the Marlborough Downs. The sarsens average approximately 20 tonnes but can be as heavy  as 30, and the largest is 30 feet long. There are no sarsens of this size left in the downs, that\u0027s why it\u0027s been such a mystery and some people have suggested they come from elsewhere as you get outcrops in other places where you have chalkland, like Decon and Kent,” Ms Greaney added. The West Wood was overlooked because its under ancient woodland, and a lot of sarsens were removed in the 19th century for roadstones, particularly in Swindon, but there are still sarsens buried in amongst the trees.To be able to pinpoint the area that Stonehenge’s builders used to source their materials around 2,500 BC is a real thrill.While the Preseli stones were probably chosen for ritual or location reasons, the sarsens were likely to have been picked for their size, archaeologists believe. But although 10 times shorter than the journey from Wales, moving 30 tonne stones would still have proven a tricky prospect and the sarsens may have moved on the River Avon for part of the way.We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size – they wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find and it made sense to get them from as nearby as possible, said Ms Greaney. This is in stark contrast to the source of the bluestones, where something quite different – a sacred connection to these mountains perhaps – was at play. Yet again, this evidence highlights just how carefully considered and deliberate the building of this phase of Stonehenge was.Professor David Nash, a geomorphologist from the University of Brighton, said: It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries.”The team is now hoping to carry out more survey work on the Marlborough Downs, looking for sarsen chips and wedges which might indicate where the original location of the stones.The research was published in the journal Science Advances.In 2008, the X-ray spectrometry technique was used to visualise the paint below Vincent van Gogh\u0027s Patch of Grass and pick out the inidual brush strokes as well as the  flesh tones of the hidden head of a woman.Cornell University has also used it to analyse inscriptions from Greek and Roman pottery. Carvings that have been entirely worn away on the surface can still be visible through the tiny amount of iron left by a chisel, allowing words to emerge from seemingly smooth stone.In 2011, an unfinished self-portrait of Rembrandt was discovered under another painting using X-ray fluorescence.Conservation experts used the technique to understand the origins of the 1,400-year-old Staffordshire Hoard, a collection of more than 3,500 Anglo-Saxon artefacts discovered by a metal detector enthusiast in a field in Staffordshire in 2009.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"western liberals covid myopia condemning worlds poorest","story":"Lockdown has polarised British society widening the gulf between the haves and have-nots, in a culture war yielding familiar tropes and characters. “Just stay at home, it’s not hard,” says the lawyer to the electrician. “Don’t sunbathe in the park!” cries Pandora from her Notting Hill townhouse. There is some truth in the caricature. But few have noted how the Pandora effect is also playing out on a monstrous global scale, inflicting unimaginable suffering. Around the world, lockdowns are pushing the already impoverished into outright destitution. Stay-at-home orders – bad enough for employees in countries with welfare states – become lethal for hand-to-mouth workers reliant on a daily income to survive. An estimated one billion people globally depend on money sent home from family members abroad, yet as millions have been laid off and confined, jobless, to their homes, remittances are projected to fall by a fifth this year in what the World Bank calls “the sharpest decline in recent history”. Environmentalists may rejoice at the plunge in air traffic, but the collapse in tourism has also destroyed one highly effective way of transferring wealth from advanced economies to developing ones. Farmers in the developing world, unable to sell their produce, face ruin due to the destruction of global supply chains. Restrictions on movement, and a collapse in funding for humanitarian agencies, are blocking the distribution of aid to the neediest people on earth. Lockdown-associated economic turmoil is weighing particularly heavily on the young and vulnerable. In India, destitution is propelling desperate parents into the arms of human traffickers, with their false promises of lucrative jobs for children in mega-cities like New Delhi and Mumbai. According to the UN, Covid-linked malnutrition is causing the deaths of an additional 10,000 children a month. Tragically, lockdowns look set to kill many more youngsters than the virus itself.Such consequences, long predicted, are now too blatant to ignore. Yet the parochialism and narrow-mindedness of our debate has been extraordinary. Obsessing over the possibility of a second wave, our Government seems incapable of computing the economic consequences of not lifting lockdown, domestically and for the world beyond Europe. Despite the wildly differing circumstances, bodies such as the World Health Organisation have largely promoted the same, Western playbook of containment. Their advice ignores what should be core variables such as when stay-at-home orders mean confining millions in cramped, poorly sanitised conditions, or that the exorbitant human cost of an economic downturn will be greater with millions already below the poverty line. Even the comparatively young demographics of developing nations has been widely overlooked. There are alternatives to this clunky template. Primarily to avert economic meltdown, Pakistan rolled back many of its shutdown measures in a modified strategy designed to balance lives and livelihoods – an approach so far vindicated by falling case numbers. President Imran Khan has even broached the question of long-term coexistence with the virus – something few UK lawmakers have been bold enough to do.It may seem an odd concept, at a time of creeping poverty, but there is an air of luxury – even decadence – about our lockdown obsession. In a form of latter-day imperialism, countries that can afford to weather the economic storm (or believe they can) are demanding their model be imposed on impoverished countries for which it guarantees catastrophe. How ironic, yet how unsurprising, that Western liberals, immersed in identity politics and “check your privilege”, have ignored the unequal effects of lockdown on the global economy.It should require little imagination to perceive the colossal humanitarian harm of closing down entire societies and economies. Yet Covid myopia has blinded too many to the fact that decisions, policies and changes in consumer habits cannot be disentangled from the wider world. For months, those who raised such concerns have been shouted down by lockdown fanatics with cries of “one life is too many”. No longer. The developing world cannot afford to hunker down and await the virus’s eradication. Neither can we. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 30th july 2020","story":"IWM London unveils brand new artwork by internationally renowned artist Ai WeiweiHeathcliff O\u0026#39Malley for The  Coronavirus latest news: Isolation raised to 10 days after research found virus may be transmitted 7-9 days after symptoms showPolitics latest news: \u0026#39Quite likely\u0026#39 that more countries will join quarantine list, says Matt HancockTravel latest: Swedish virus expert says \u0026#39no point\u0026#39 in face masks, as Madeira makes them mandatory Joshua Wong among 12 excluded from Hong Kong elections Police officer stabbed during routine stop and search Watch: How NASA\u0026#39s new Mars rover will search for signs of ancient life on the red planet Nasa Mars 2020 launch: Perseverance rover set for lift-offRape prosecutions fall to record lowCoronavirus, six months on: Everything we know about the disease that has swept the worldComment: \u0026#39Demolish\u0026#39 the old high street to rebuild the newThe chink of light in Spain’s care home catastropheThursday morning news briefing: Self-isolation period to increase by three daysComment: Covid has doomed the shell-shocked millennials to be a lost generation The Muppet Man: how Lew Grade invented popular TVMystery of Stonehenge\u0026#39s giant pillars solved at lastBeing overweight in your 20s almost doubles the risk of dementia, major study findsBoris Johnson faces demands from Tory MPs and industry for airport testing to replace quarantine to boost holiday travel and tradeClaire Fox: the BBC is the \u0026#39woke\u0026#39 channelChildren face unduly harsh sentences in adult courts as delays push cases past their 18th birthdays, say MPsThe doctor will WhatsApp you now: Matt Hancock to announce NHS reforms in wake of coronavirusMothers bearing the brunt of home schooling with twice as much teaching as fathers, survey showsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"quarter uks native mammals face extinction rare bat topping","story":"A quarter of the UK\u0027s mammals are at risk of extinction according to a new UN-approved list issued by the Mammal Society. The head of Natural England, Tony Juniper, has warned that these declines will continue unless their depleted habitats are restored, and reintroductions take place.Among those species listed as being at risk of extinction in Britain are the water vole, hedgehog, hazel dormouse and the wildcat. The European wolf is already extinct.Topping the list is the greater mouse-eared bat, with scientists believing there is just one left in the UK. The lonely creature roots in a railway tunnel in Sussex.These large bats, with a half-metre wide wing, were first discovered in the UK in the late 1950s. A fascination with the animals caused collectors to pay large sums for dead specimens and many were wiped out as a result. The mammals could perhaps be introduced from colonies in Europe, but a rabies risk means they would have to be quarantined for six months on arrival, and this could impact their survival in the wild.Mr Juniper told The : “If we’re going to reverse the decline in fortunes in some of these animals, what we have to do is reverse the reasons in which they\u0027ve disappeared in the first place. For some it was historical persecution, for others it was pollution, for some it was species that came in and brought disease, and for more it was the fragmentation of their habitat. We need to put in place the means to reduce these pressures and rebuild their ecosystem so they begin to thrive again.He added that reintroducing some mammals will help others at greater risk of extinction, with one example being pine martens. These, he said are ferocious predators of grey squirrels, which threaten the endangered red squirrel population by spreading disease. Pine martens were recently reintroduced to the Forest of Dean to keep the grey squirrel population down.The animal it will be most challenging to save from extinction, he said, is the Scottish wildcat. Mr Juniper explained: The one that is nearest to the edge is the Scottish wildcat that disappeared from England a long time ago, during the 19th century, that one will only come back with reintroduction. It would require connected areas of habitat and resolve the problem of cross breeding with domestic cats so finding areas remote enough away from pets.For some animals, reintroduction is all they need. Those such as beavers and pine martens declined because of historic persecution, which has now mostly stopped. However, for the majority on the list, there simply is not enough appropriate habitat to sustain large populations.The Natural England head used the example of the hazel dormouse, which has lost many of the woodlands it used to call home. He explained: We have been involved with quite a few successful dormouse reintroductions over the years and encouraging them into places where they’ve been lost but we need to have hedges connecting areas of ancient woodland and isolated populations and use our ambition of 30,000 hectares of new woodland a year to fill in those gaps.” Fiona Mathews, a professor of Environmental Biology at the University of Sussex, compiled the list. She assessed in each mammal\u0027s case whether the population is declining, the geographical range, fragmentation, decline or fluctuation, how small the population is and whether there is any quantitative analysis of extinction risk.She said:  “The new Red List provides a very clear basis for prioritising funding and conservation efforts for the future. Twenty species — those classed as Threatened, Near Threatened, and Data Deficient — all need urgent attention. While we bemoan the demise of wildlife in other parts of the world, here in Britain we are managing to send even rodents towards extinction. Things have to change rapidly if we want our children and grandchildren to enjoy the wildlife we take for granted.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel latestswedish virus expert says no point face masks madeira","story":"Unlike many European countries, people in Sweden are not required to wear face masks in public areasThe face mask rules in your favourite European holiday destinations Germans flock to Spain after Britons bannedHoliday quarantine: Which country will be next?Sign up to  Travel\u0027s newsletter Sweden\u0027s leading coronavirus expert has dismissed the effectiveness of face masks as the country\u0027s Covid-19 rates continue to tumble.State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has been a staunch defender of Sweden\u0027s controversial decision not to go into lockdown during the pandemic, even when the Swedish mortality rate far outstripped that of neighbouring Scandinavian nations like Norway and Finland, where much stricter measures were imposed.Now, with the number of new infections having fallen rapidly over the course of July, Mr Tegnell has backed the Swedish government\u0027s decision not to implement rigid face masks rules that could prevent a second wave.“With numbers diminishing very quickly in Sweden, we see no point in wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public transport,” he said.Many other European countries have been tightening rules surrounding masks in public areas in recent weeks: both Greece and Romania yesterday made them mandatory in shops and supermarkets, while Madeira is now enforcing their use on beaches and mountain walks.With an entire industry still on a knife-edge, the Scottish government has pledged a £14m recovery package to support the country\u0027s hotels until summer 2021.It is hoped that the cash injection will protect up to 3,000 jobs as Scottish hotels struggle for survival, with travel bans and quarantine continuing to take their toll on profits.Some Scottish hoteliers have complained that even English guests have been cancelling bookings for 2020, citing concerns over Nicola Sturgeon\u0027s repeated warnings that Scotland could impose quarantine restrictions on the rest of the UK.Government flip-flopping on travel bans and quarantines has drawn more than a few comparisons to Armando Iannucci’s political comedy over the last few weeks.

The industry is now in its fourth successive year of decline. Even if there is no second wave of coronavirus to shut down factories once again, British car production in 2020 will only recover to about a half of last year’s figure, at 880,000 or so. Many companies have announced job losses, including Bentley Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan, and the SMMT expects many more to follow.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMuch depends on how quickly consumer confidence returns at home and, especially, abroad, as about eight in every ten cars made in the UK is exported. The “furlough” Job Retention Scheme has been an “absolute lifeline”. Cycling alone won\u0027t save the planet – we need green motor investmentThe SMMT points out that Britain is hardly alone in suffering the effects of the coronavirus crisis, but the additional uncertainties still surrounding the end of the Brexit transition period are uniquely adding to its difficulties, with potentially grave consequences. The EU remains easily the UK\u0027s largest export market and source of componentry. Trading on World Trade Organisation terms, say the SMMT, would lead to a cumulative lost output of some 1.46 million cars worth around £40bn in revenues by 2025. That would far extend the job losses of 11,000 already announced thus year, and leave the UK an increasingly small, niche player in the global auto industry. That would mean losing critical mass, economies of scale and ability to continue to attract investment into new technologies such as battery and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. An ambitious free trade agreement with the EU, with no tariffs, non tariff barriers and bureaucracy would mean that the UK might still be “in the game”. The chief executive of the SMMT, Mike Hawes insists that the Brexit trade deal “must be ambitious”: UK car industry slumps to nine-year lowNissan and Ford suspend car production due to Covid-19Hard Brexit would ‘slash UK car production by a third’“Our factories were once set to make two million cars in 2020 but could now produce less than half that number, a result of the devastating effects of the pandemic on top of already challenging market conditions and years of Brexit uncertainty.”“This industry has demonstrated its inherent competitiveness and global excellence over the past decade. Its long-term future now depends on securing a good deal and a long-term strategy that supports an industry on which so many thousands of jobs across the country depend.”The SMMT add that even if talks end as planned in October and are successful there won’t be sufficient time before January 1st for companies to make the necessary (and as yet unknown) preparations, such as defining how much of the value of a given car, van or lorry is “British”, under “rules of origin”. An “implementation period” is normal practice for trade deals, and the SMMT argue it is inevitable in a complex manufacturing business such as theirs. Around nine out of 10 firms in the sector say there’s not enough clarity about what us about to happen for them to make plans. As for the domestic market the industry expressed scepticism about the usefulness of any general scrappage scheme, as was introduced during the financial crash in 2009. With a background of a Covid plus Brexit “double whammy” the industry favours targeted support for R\u0026ampD, to help make Britain an attractive destination for investment in the coming decade.

But it will be hard for Huawei to maintain its lead in the long term, said analyst Mo Jia. Its major channel partners in key regions, such as Europe, are increasingly wary of ranging Huawei devices, taking on fewer models, and bringing new brands to reduce risk. Strength in China alone will not be enough to sustain Huawei at the top once the global economy starts to recover.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A man on a neighbouring plot told the agency that the garden had not been used for the last two years.German authorities said last month they had identified a 43-year-old German citizen as a suspect in the case and are investigating him on suspicion of murder.Brueckner, 43, is currently in prison for drug dealing, and is appealing a conviction for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Praia da Luz. The attack happened a year and a half before Madeleine’s disappearance.Germany’s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has said Brueckner had a history of child sex offences and other crimes, including drug trafficking and burgling holiday apartments in Portugal.Having spent many years in Portugal since 1995, after fleeing a German prison sentence, he was last registered as living in the German city of Braunschweig, which is about 64km (40 miles) from Hanover.Scotland Yard has previously admitted Brueckner was among 600 people previously considered of potential significance during the McCann inquiry, but was not considered a suspect until a 2017 appeal unearthed new information.Additional reporting by PANo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The UAE launched its Hope orbiter last week, followed by the Chinese Questions to Heaven spacecraft shortly after.The European Space Agency and Roscosmos were forced to postpone the launch of their lander, Rosalind Franklin, after delays meant it would not be able to leave in time.The launch window opens at 7.50am local eastern time, or 12.50am in the UK.Nasa has a two-hour window for the launch, meaning that if conditions are bad at the beginning, it will be able to wait it out in the hope that they will clear. (That is in contrast with recent launches like the crewed SpaceX mission, which either had to launch on time or couldn\u0027t launch at all, leading its first attempt to be scrubbed.)But the weather is looking pretty good. There is a 20 per cent chance that bad weather could cause problems – the concerns are with clouds expected above the launchpad.Welcome to\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s coverage of Nasa\u0027s mission to Mars.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Archaeologists have solved one of Stonehenge’s greatest mysteries — the precise source of the world-famous prehistoric temple’s largest stones.A new scientific breakthrough has, for the first time, allowed geologists to pinpoint almost exactly where Stonehenge’s giant stone uprights and lintels came from.Up until now, all that archaeologists knew with reasonable certainty was that the stones (a type of rock known as sarsen) had been brought in around 2500BC by the great temple’s Neolithic builders from the Marlborough Downs or immediately adjacent areas — a 75 sq miles area, 15-25 miles north of Stonehenge.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut now scientists from the University of Brighton have traced the stones to a small very specific two sq mile part of that range of hills — a patch of woodland just south of the village of Lockeridge, Wiltshire.In prehistoric and indeed later times, that area (now known as West Woods) seems to have been strewn with particularly large sarsen boulders, geochemically identical to those used to build Stonehenge.Humans reached Americas 11,000 years earlier than previously thoughtRecent detailed examination of the West Woods area by Reading University archaeologist, Katy Whitaker, suggests that the builders of Stonehenge probably chose it as their source of stone because of the exceptional sizes and relative flatness of many of its sarsen boulders.New archaeological research about the site has revealed that even 1200 years before Stonehenge was built, the West Woods area’s great sarsen slabs were used to construct a massive local prehistoric tomb.Now that the source of Stonehenge’s great stones has finally been identified, archaeological attention is likely to turn to discovering the precise route used by the monument’s prehistoric builders to move the giant 20-40tn stones from West Woods to Stonehenge (a distance of around 15 miles).There are two main options — an eastern route down the Wiltshire Avon Valley and a western route across Salisbury Plain.The western option would have involved a short segment where they would have had to haul the boulders up a 14 per cent gradient for around 300m.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It would almost certainly not have been possible to use a raft on that river (the Wiltshire Avon) because the width of raft required to transport such large boulders would almost certainly have been much greater than the width of the river itself.On the balance of probabilities, it’s perhaps more likely that the builders of Stonehenge opted for the western route, despite the need to haul the stones up a hill.That route would have taken them south from West Woods across the southern part of the Marlborough Downs and down a very steep hill into the Vale of Pewsey. They would then have taken what was perhaps an already ancient trackway past (or indeed through) a huge prehistoric ritual and ceremonial complex (at Marden) across the river Avon and then up onto Salisbury Plain.It was that ascent onto Salisbury Plain, which involved the only moderately steep part of the journey (the 14 per cent gradient). Then they would have crossed the relatively flat and unforested plain to Stonehenge itself.If they did opt for this, on balance easier, western route, then the fact that they (and their massive stones) would have passed by or through the Marden ritual complex is potentially significant.In architectural terms, Stonehenge was destined to be the most impressive religious complex in Neolithic Britain — but Marden may well have been the biggest.Archaeological investigations over recent years (led by archaeologist, Dr Jim Leary, now of the University of York) have revealed that the Marden complex consisted of three great monuments — a vast 500m diameter banked enclosure north of the River Avon, a huge roughly 20m tall, 70m diameter ceremonial mound in the centre of that enclosure — and another banked enclosure, south of the river, surrounded by a 100m diameter circle of massive 1m diameter wooden “obelisks”.Having discovered the source of the giant stones of Stonehenge, archaeologists may soon be in in a position to make another potentially significant discovery about more than 100 fragments of sarsen stone found at Marden.In deploying the same scientific techniques used to pinpoint the source of the Stonehenge sarsens, scientists may ultimately be able to discover where the Marden fragments came from. Detailed preliminary examination of those enigmatic fragments will begin later this year.Those fragments appear to have been gathered together in the Marden ritual complex at around the same time that the Stonehenge sarsens may have been passing through that monument.So if it were ultimately to turn out that the Marden fragments came from West Woods, then it is conceivable that those fragments may have been removed from Stonehenge-bound sarsen boulders — potentially to shape them (and thus reduce their weight) prior to their ascent onto Salisbury Plain.Sarsen stone, the type of rock used to build Stonehenge and Avebury stone circle, may well have been regarded as profoundly mysterious by prehistoric people — because they normally only occur as loose or semi-buried boulders, completely unconnected to any bedrock. Indeed, the bedrock in the Marlborough Downs is chalk — so the presence (back in the Neolithic) of hundreds of thousands of often huge boulders composed of an obviously totally different type of stone (sometimes even arranged in straight lines across the landscape) would have been seen by prehistoric people as unusual.Worldwide, anomalous stones have often been regarded by many cultures as spiritually and physically interchangeable with humans — sometimes with a belief that particular stones contained the souls, spirits or even the transformed mortal remains of the dead. The belief was widespread, occurring on virtually every continent.It is likely therefore that the builders of Stonehenge, Avebury and other stone circles perceived sarsen in both practical construction terms and also in more spiritual ones.In geological terms, sarsen is just a very hard sandstone. It was formed around 50 million years ago when fresh groundwater gradually deposited additional silica while flowing through sand deposits. In some places, that silica then acted as a natural “glue” to bind trillions of sand grains together, thus forming solid rock.When later erosion subsequently removed the surrounding “unglued” (ie loose) sand, all that was left were the sarsen boulders.Because the chemicals in the original sand varied from locality to locality, modern scientists have now been able to develop a way of producing very accurate chemical fingerprints for sarsen stones from different locations. The system has been developed by University of Brighton geomorphologist and geographer, Professor David Nash. He has now used it to solve the mystery of where Stonehenge’s sarsens came from. It’s the first time that sarsen “fingerprinting” has been used to solve a major archaeological puzzle. The new British Academy funded research is being published today by the American on-line free-access journal Science Advances.“It has been really exciting to harness 21st-century science to understand the Neolithic past, and finally answer a question that archaeologists have been debating for centuries,” said Professor Nash.“We can now say, when sourcing the sarsens, the overriding objective was size,” said English Heritage senior properties historian Susan Greaney.‘Astonishing’ discovery of ancient monument next to Stonehenge“The builders of Stonehenge wanted the biggest, most substantial stones they could find,” she added.As well as the giant sarsen stones, Stonehenge also has a significant number of much smaller stones (the so-called bluestones). Over the years, scientists have succeeded in demonstrating that those smaller (2-3tn) standing stones were brought by Stonehenge’s builders from southwest Wales.Professor Nash was able to analyse the Stonehenge sarsens because a core extracted from one of the monuments giant stones during repair work in the 1950s (and taken to America by one of the engineers involved in that work) was returned to English Heritage last year.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Advocates of vertical farming say benefits include eliminating run-off of polluted water and reducing food air miles.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milkThe video footage showed goats at Far Marsh Farm crying out in pain as they were held by their necks, had their ears tagged or had their tails twisted.

We are horrified. We had no idea this was going on.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers.

This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The period of self-isolation for people who have symptoms or test positive for Covid-19 is being extended from seven to 10 days, effective from today, the UK’s chief medical officers have announced.The move - which covers the whole country - brings the UK in line with the World Health Organisation’s recommendation of 10-day minimum isolation and with rules in many other countries including Australia, South Africa and Switzerland.Experts believe that the extra three days of isolation will reduce the danger of spreading the virus, but they stressed that anyone whose symptoms - other than a cough or loss of sense of smell - persist beyond 10 days should continue to stay away from other people in case they are still contagious.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt is understood that authorities are not expecting the change to lead to a sharp increase in iniduals confined at home, as the availability of testing means that anyone suspecting they have coronavirus can now quickly establish whether they have the disease, with negative tests allowing them to cease self-isolation immediately.The change in advice is not understood to have been driven by any new scientific breakthrough, but to be a response to emerging evidence that contagiousness can linger up to nine days after symptoms manifest themselves, as well as to the lifting of lockdown restrictions which have made it possible for people to mingle more outside their homes.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with Covid-19 who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between seven and nine days after illness onset.We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from seven to 10 days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.This will help provide additional protection to others in the community. This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.As ballot papers go out today for the Liberal Democrat leadership contest, Sir Ed Davey’s campaign has been boosted by a joint letter from more than 200 party figures – including former leaders Tim Farron and Sir Menzies Campbell and five of the party’s 11 MPs – endorsing his candidacy.With the delayed election finally getting under way in earnest, a think tank report found that the Lib Dems’ best route back to electoral success lies in “cosying up” to Sir Keir Starmer’s Labour, as the party’s most winnable seats lie in a “yellow halo” in the London suburbs and home counties of the southeast where they are the main rivals to Tories.Davey has made it clear he would position the party to the left of centre and has firmly ruled out a repeat of the 2010 Tory-Lib Dem coalition, while rival Layla Moran has said she would “never say never” to a pact with Sir Keir.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesToday’s letter – seen by The Independent – states that Davey has the “experience, vision and judgement” to rebuild the party following three bruising elections which have seen its numbers at Westminster savagely reduced and former leader Jo Swinson even losing her own seat in December.Signed by MPs Mr Farron, Daisy Cooper, Munira Wilson, Sarah Olney and Christine Jardine along with many councillors and activists as well as ex-deputy leader Malcolm Bruce, former MPs including Paul Burstow and Sarah Wollaston and the author of the post-mortem into the 2019 election debacle, Dorothy Thornhill, the letter states: “Ed has presented a clear, coherent vision for the future of the party that stands for a fairer, greener, more caring country. A country where we give universal free childcare to parents, where we invest £150bn in green jobs and renewable homes and where we give the 10 million carers in the UK a new, better deal.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

Only by moving on from the coalition and rebuilding trust will we win again and deliver the progressive change our country so desperately needs.

But many are expected to respond immediately as voting slips appear on doormats and in email inboxes, making the next few days crucial to the campaign.KIngston and Surbiton MP Davey said he was “proud that so many people – from grassroots activists to a majority of my colleagues in parliament – are putting their faith in me as the candidate with the experience, vision and judgement necessary to rebuild the party and take on Boris Johnson”.He added: ”Our country faces huge challenges, as does our party. The election review showed there are no quick fixes to these challenges and I am determined to rebuild our party on solid foundations so we can elect more Liberal Democrats into town halls, council chambers and parliaments across the country.”The scale of the challenge facing the victor in this summer’s poll was laid bare in the UK in a Changing Europe report, which noted that “there is no such thing as a Lib Dem safe seat – even for the party’s leader”.Its authors, led by Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary, University of London, said there was a “distinct possibility” of the new leader taking the party into “long-term paralysis” as happened to its forerunner Liberal Party between 1945 and the formation of the SDP in 1983, when Commons representation rarely scraped into double figures.And the new leader will inherit a new core vote of educated graduates in the southeast and university cities, which has virtually displaced the former liberal heartlands of the southwest and the Celtic fringe.Despite losing seats in 2019, the report found Lib Dems are now “within realistic touching distance” of securing 50 seats where they either won or came a close second in December. They either hold or are highly competitive in 30 per cent of the 64 seats with most graduates as voters.And the overwhelming bulk of their main target seats – 23 out of the 29 most winnable – are Tory-held, with just nine where Labour and Lib Dems took first and second places in 2019.“The areas of growth – where Jo Swinson did better than Nick Clegg – provide a ‘yellow halo’ of new electoral strength for the party in parts of London, Surrey, Oxfordshire, Berkshire, Hampshire and Cambridgeshire,” wrote Prof Bale.“In theory, this provides the conditions for a symbiotic relationship with Keir Starmer’s Labour Party. In practice, of course, things might not be quite so easy – not when many Lib Dem activists are also councillors – or would-be councillors – on local authorities where there is no love lost between them and their Labour counterparts. For some of them, the building of some kind of progressive alliance nationally will be far lower down their list of priorities than taking on and beating Labour locally.”The report warned: “Both candidates for the Lib Dem leadership will have to live with the real possibility that political and personal defeat could end up being the price of taking the job. But it is a job that brings with it a genuine opportunity to grow the party once again – if, that is, they make the right strategic calls.”UK in a changing europe\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.MPs have accused the government of being detached from reality after it prioritised premium food retailers like Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Waitrose over discount chains for inclusion in its free school meal voucher programme.The Commons Environment and Food Committee said the system, designed to ensure children from low income families were fed while schools were closed for the pandemic, was set up with commendable speed in response to the pandemic.But they criticised the design of the scheme, which meant the vouchers initially could not be used at supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl or local corner shops, but could be spent at M\u0026ampS and Waitrose — where the vouchers would buy significant less.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMPs accepted that “some teething problems were inevitable” with the scheme, but said they were “disappointed at the apparent lack of willingness to quickly adapt the scheme in response to the issues that emerged”.“The system has been beset by significant problems, ultimately leading to about a third of children experiencing greater food insecurity in the first month,” they said in a report released on Thursday after taking evidence from food poverty experts.Free school meal vouchers scheme in trouble as key stores excludedJohnson U-turn on school meals after Rashford campaign“A particular problem was the government’s immediate reliance on the larger retailers to participate in the scheme, with discounters and convenience stores excluded for technical reasons, even when they were able to offer workable voucher schemes which would have helped more children. There was a need for closer collaboration on the part of both government and retailers. “The government did not sufficiently consider the realities of where families dependent on free school meals were most likely to shop for food. Although more retailers were added to the scheme, we consider that this took too long.”The MPs are calling on the government to appoint a minister to food security and consult on whether a right to food should be enshrined in legislation.And they said the food insecurity situation exacerbated by the pandemic was likely to get worse before it got better.Stephanie Wood, CEO of the charity School Food Matters, told the committee in evidence that “lots of people are really angry that DfE has defaulted to the big six supermarkets, two of which are really irrelevant when it comes to families on low income: Marks \u0026amp Sparks and Waitrose”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After a significant delay Aldi, McColls, Iceland and the Company Shop group eventually joined the scheme. Created with Sketch.Coronavirus: The global gap in education Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Neil Parish, chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee, said: “The lockdown may have eased, but problems with food security are far from over. Food banks and other food redistribution organisations have reacted heroically to a shocking spike in demand for food aid, but this problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. It is therefore essential that the government appoints a new minister for food security who will stop this issue falling between the cracks.  “The government’s actions to lock-down the country and close businesses were necessary, but they had huge impacts on the food sector and on food security. Defra’s response once the crisis hit was commendable, but despite warnings from other countries, it seemed as though the government was constantly playing catch-up in trying to support the food industry during this crisis. The pandemic also highlighted our reliance on key workers, and I unreservedly thank those in the food supply chain whose work kept the nation fed throughout the crisis. “In the future, the government will need to communicate better with the public. The voucher scheme for free school meals failed to recognise where families using them were likely to shop and encouraging everyone to shop online, when supermarkets had warned they would struggle to meet demand, set the scene for public frustration.  We want the government to learn lessons for the future.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The industry is now in its fourth successive year of decline. Even if there is no second wave of coronavirus to shut down factories once again, British car production in 2020 will only recover to about a half of last year’s figure, at 880,000 or so. Many companies have announced job losses, including Bentley Motors, Jaguar Land Rover and Nissan, and the SMMT expects many more to follow.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMuch depends on how quickly consumer confidence returns at home and, especially, abroad, as about eight in every ten cars made in the UK is exported. The “furlough” Job Retention Scheme has been an “absolute lifeline”. Cycling alone won\u0027t save the planet – we need green motor investmentThe SMMT points out that Britain is hardly alone in suffering the effects of the coronavirus crisis, but the additional uncertainties still surrounding the end of the Brexit transition period are uniquely adding to its difficulties, with potentially grave consequences. The EU remains easily the UK\u0027s largest export market and source of componentry. Trading on World Trade Organisation terms, say the SMMT, would lead to a cumulative lost output of some 1.46 million cars worth around £40bn in revenues by 2025. That would far extend the job losses of 11,000 already announced thus year, and leave the UK an increasingly small, niche player in the global auto industry. That would mean losing critical mass, economies of scale and ability to continue to attract investment into new technologies such as battery and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. An ambitious free trade agreement with the EU, with no tariffs, non tariff barriers and bureaucracy would mean that the UK might still be “in the game”. The chief executive of the SMMT, Mike Hawes insists that the Brexit trade deal “must be ambitious”: UK car industry slumps to nine-year lowNissan and Ford suspend car production due to Covid-19Hard Brexit would ‘slash UK car production by a third’“Our factories were once set to make two million cars in 2020 but could now produce less than half that number, a result of the devastating effects of the pandemic on top of already challenging market conditions and years of Brexit uncertainty.”“This industry has demonstrated its inherent competitiveness and global excellence over the past decade. Its long-term future now depends on securing a good deal and a long-term strategy that supports an industry on which so many thousands of jobs across the country depend.”The SMMT add that even if talks end as planned in October and are successful there won’t be sufficient time before January 1st for companies to make the necessary (and as yet unknown) preparations, such as defining how much of the value of a given car, van or lorry is “British”, under “rules of origin”. An “implementation period” is normal practice for trade deals, and the SMMT argue it is inevitable in a complex manufacturing business such as theirs. Around nine out of 10 firms in the sector say there’s not enough clarity about what us about to happen for them to make plans. As for the domestic market the industry expressed scepticism about the usefulness of any general scrappage scheme, as was introduced during the financial crash in 2009. With a background of a Covid plus Brexit “double whammy” the industry favours targeted support for R\u0026ampD, to help make Britain an attractive destination for investment in the coming decade.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders are risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The first day of Eid al-Adha marks the end of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah.Due to Islam traditionally using the lunar calendar the date does sht and its not officially on until theres a clear enough sky showing the crescent of a new moon.This means that there is also a day-long iation between countries depending on where they are in the world.In the UK Eid al-Adha  will begin on the evening of Thursday, July , and end on the evening of Monday, August .Eid usually starts with Muslims going to the Mosque for prayers in new finery.As the name would suggest, over the weekend there is usually the sacrice of a sheep, goat, camel or cow. The act is called Qurbani.In the period around Eid al-Adha, many Muslims travel to Mecca and the surrounding area in Saudi Arabia to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, which is one of the five pillars of Islam.It is a public holiday in traditionally or majority Muslim countries like Indonesia or the United Arab Emirates, but it isnt in more historically Christian countries like the UK.In the UK the animal is slaughtered in a slaughterhouse, but in other countries it is often done as part of a public ritual.It is a time that is spent visiting family and friends, usually involving a big meal and some partying. Kids often get presents too.The meat is shared equally between family, friends and the poor and unlike Eid al-Fitr, the meals made are predominantly savoury. It is a time when they visit family and friends. Muslims will also give money to charity so the less fortunate are also able to celebrate.There are two Eids, which makes things a bit confusing for those not brought up in Islam.Firstly, Eid means feast, so theyre both family gatherings and a good excuse for a party.Eid al-Fitr is celebrated at the end of Ramadan, this year it was in late May, to celebrate the end of fasting.Eid al-Fitr is often referred to as the sweet feast as Muslims will tend to put a greater emphasis on puddings. Eid al-Adha is the one thats coming up this Thursday and is the holier of the two feasts.It coincides with the end of the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, and is around two months after Eid al-Fitr.It is deemed the savoury or salty feast as there is a surplus of meat from the sacrice of the cattle that gets shared around everyone.Eid al-Adha sees the sacrices made as a symbolic act to mimic the near-sacrice of Ibrahimwho agreed to sacrice his son Ishmael when Allah God asked him to in repeated dreams.Ibrahim leads Ishmael to Mount Arafat, tied up his son and stuck a blindfold on so he wouldnt have to watch him suffer. The story goes that Allah replaced Ibrahim with a sheep as Ibrahim blindly flung the kne at his son. Other iations include an angel stepping in at the last moment and giving him a sheep or goat.This is the same story from the Old Testament of Abraham and Isaac.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But time is getting short now.”A former friend said Christian B fantasised about creating a Josef Fritzl-style dungeon at his home.Christian B’s pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”The sex offender allegedly revealed his fantasy to a pal while living in the German city of Brunswick after ing to his home country from Portugal.Christian Bs pal – who wanted to remain anonymous – led a TV crew to the house where the twice convicted paedophile was living around .He alleged that the now -year-old German had confided in him that he dreamed of turning the cellar of his rented home into a basement liar.Christian B is said to have wanted to create a dungeon like the one Fritzl built with soundproof walls.There is no evidence to suggest the suspect ever followed through on this idea.Christian Bs pal said: “He had a cellar and he said he wanted to line it with heavy plates, like the guy in Austria.”Madeleine would now be  years old.She was born May , , and went missing a little more than a week before her fourth birthday.Prior to the th anniversary of her disappearance, the McCanns said in an update on their FindMadeleine website: #It is now  years since we were last with Madeleine.#Her th birthday is to follow in the next couple of weeks# the latter tangibly, painfully, bringing it home to us what we have missed and continue to miss as a family.#The investigation to find Madeleine remains open and continues, even though, in a way dferent to the ideal.#We remain grateful for the ongoing efforts and commitment from all those involved in the search to find her and we hope and pray, as always, that our efforts will be fruitful.#Thank you to everyone still offering their support and good wishes for Madeleine and ourselves.#Such solidarity continues to strengthen us.#Investigators were seen pushing a skip onto a fork lt on the land in Seelze, Hanover.Police investigators have been pictured holding drones as they continue the search on Christian Bs allotment in Hanover.Locals near the site of Christian Bs former allotment site where he is said to have lived in a caravan say they saw ers nearby.

The block where he lived always stunk of cannabis, he was the local dealer.”The plot is four miles from his last known address in Hanover and just two miles from where the -year-old worked in a car workshop.He rented a garage at Euro Hobbywerkstatt in Hannover # a few miles down the road from the allotment currently being excavated by German police. He was ­nicknamed “the ­screwdriver” because he always smelled of oil and petrol.The extensive search at the site near Hanover, Germany, began after another allotment holder at the site tipped off cops after watching a Crimewatch TV show. The show features a range of unsolved crimes which included Madeleines case.Christian B previously boasted to the owner of an allotment he rented in Braunschweig, northern Germany, that he wanted to put perspex glass over a hole in the ground at her site.The search of the site # currently in its third day # is due to continue for another two days, cops confirmed.Dozens of officers are taking part in the hunt for clues that might solve one of the worlds most infamous crimes.British police officers are also taking part in the investigation and have reportedly already quizzed a garage owner who rented a workspace to Christian B.Around  officers are continuing to work on the scene of the plot of land once used by suspect Christian B.An area of trees has been cleared and a mini excavator has been used to dig the land.A total of three skips have been taken away for the material to be examined, Sky News reports.A range of tools from metal detectors to ground-penetrating radar equipment and snfer dogs are all being utilised in the search. #They have dug a big hole here, around  metres long and  to ft deep,# Sky reporter Martin Brunt said from the scene.#They are sting and raking through the piles of soil that have been tipped around the edge of that hole and the excavator is now filling the hole.#German police discovered what may have been a basement or a hidden cellar room in the remains of the foundations of a building in the allotment where kidnapping suspect Christian B allegedly lived in , Bild.de reports.Neighbours say the wooden shed was demolished in late  or  – months after Madeleine disappeared.Investigators have been removing slabs of building materials and large square stones were also excavated from the site.Wolfgang Kossack, , who owns the plot adjacent told MailOnline: #At the time there was a building on the garden. It was a small wooden structure with only one room to keep tools and other things but it had a kitchen. #The building was not really a house, you might call it a shed. But it had a cellar and underneath there would be foundations. This building was destroyed in .#The first photos of what might have been discovered in Christian Bs garden lot has been revealed. Investigators were seen carrying a skip full of debris and other unidentied material from the lot of land outside Hannover this afternoon.Officers digging at a site used by the suspect in the Madeleine McCann case appeared to fight back tears today as new photos emerged from the scene.One officer appeared emotional with a hand covering his mouth at the scene of the excavation The public prosecutors office in Braunschweig confirmed the operation, which began yesterday, and said it will last several days.

Teenagers, it turns out, are a bit of an ordeal.Studies show that mums and dads of teens are  per cent more stressed than  years ago.There’s not just the financial pressures from teens, the constant keepie-uppie with phones, computers and fashion, but the added pleasure of social media.Then throw into the mix hormones, curfews, risky behaviours, smoking, drinking and sex and you have a ­wonderful pottage of purgatory.When your children reach their teens they need to question your authority in order to find the impetus to break away and become independent adults. And they don’t do this lightly. No, they make sure they also judge and question your parenting and basically suck the le out of you.For most of us women it also often coincides with the menopause and ­possibly mid-le crises. I mean, could there be a more perfect storm  Unsurprisingly, girls are more antagonistic towards the female parent. And research shows the task of setting limits for their teenagers falls more to mothers than it does to fathers.I have four childrenand they are all very dferent. One no longer lives at home. He’s  and is my Goldenballs, as his teenage years really lulled me into a  sense of security, being largely painless.I also have two girls, aged  and , plus a boy of . So far . . . and I do love you, girls, BUT . . . the boys are proving simpler, less complicated. Unconscious bias, possibly.Lockdown with these hoodlums forced me to question my sanity, made me feel like I was in freefall and wonder what the hell I had been thinking all those times in the past when my ­Fallopian tubes would jump for joy as soon as I saw a man.I’m a liberal parent. I haven’t sought to make my children my “friends” but I ­certainly wasn’t prepared for the ­contempt, defiance, audacity and ­confrontation that has arrived. About everything, from changing the toilet rollto rudeness , politenessand lack of empathy . I’m not allowed to utter the words, “Well, when I was a teenager”, because allegedly I’ve never been one.I can’t offer advice because I “don’t understand”. I’m not allowed to discipline because that’s “damaging”.I’ve been reprimanded for calling one of the Ungratefuls “lazy”. In modern times, this is “injurious and prejudicial”, I was told. Yes, she used those words. I did once try to explain that she’s intelligent and could go far. “Intelligent” is also detrimental to her mental wellbeing, I was informed.Give me strength.At the beginning of lockdown, I would cry out loud and scream from time to time — just to let off steam because I felt utterly trapped.And because I was parenting on my own, I guess there is no need for orce or separation or marriage breakdown now.But I felt utterly blindsided by the scale of the task because teens nowadays are savvy buggers who are well versed in conversations about ious “conditions” everyone seems to be struggling with — mental health, eating disorders, anxiety.Which is great. But not so great when you’re trying to run through a minefield to get to the other side before they ­criticise your parenting abilities and make you feel like a complete sham.Things have improved slightly. It was that or murder. But it has sapped me of all my energy and made me question what I was thinking when I thought that having kids was a great idea.I joke, of course. They can bring me enormous pleasure when they actually do change the toilet roll. Butyou think weaning and sleep-training is tough, wait until you join the Bewildered Mum Of Teens Club.A very close friend of mine always used to say: “Small children, small problems. Big children, big problems.” So enjoy your little eight-pounder while you can.I exaggerate not when I say I’m sometimes scared to open my mouth at home because one of the Ungratefuls has been a ­passionate advocate of social justice since she first strung a sentence together. Often, I am jokingly and harmlessly inappropriate and un-PC, only succeeding in pushing my middle-age boundaries in a woke world of righteous fundamentalists. But it was when my -year-old Ungrateful sat at the table with a look of absolute panic on his face that I realised things have gone too far. All he had asked his ­sister was: “Can you pass the black pepper  Or is that racist ”I WAS disturbed to learn that the puppy Katie Price bought for her -year-old daughter Princess died in an accident at home. There’s more than one lesson there for a young girl, I would have thought.I was equally disturbed to learn there has been an increase in people buying puppies during lockdown – because apparently, what  is there to do  Except puppies require a lot of work and attention, demand constant ­surveillance and are sentient beings with needs that require a long-term emotional and financial commitment.I worry about how many of these pets will be surrendered or neglected once “normal le” resumes.And why people won’t consider ­adopting rescue dogs when shelters and rescue centres are brimming with ownerless animals.A dog is for le. Not just for lockdown.LOVELY newsreader George Alagiah said that when he first came to England from Ghana at the age of  and headed to boarding school, he made damn sure he had a cut-glass English accent in order to avoid racist and classist bullies.As a foreigner who arrived from Sweden at the same age, I had the same ambition – I wanted to sound like the locals and did not want to stand out.I became all the more determined after slipping up when getting “soup” and “soap” confused, mistaking a sofa “suite” for a sofa “suit” and always referring to spiders’ “cod webs”.It burned like hell to be laughed at because you couldn’t speak properly.Now, I’m pleased to say, my grammar and English is often better than my peers’ because I had to learn everything from scratch and I didn’t want to attract attention.Until I decided on a job in TV, that is.HANDSOME Viking eye-candy Dolph Lundgren has just got engaged. He turns  in November and his fiancée Emma Krokdal is .We shrug this off because a he’s a bloke, b age is just a number and c what is  years between two lovers Except when I was questioned ahead of my appearance on Celeb First Dates Hotel last year about what age range I would consider for a partner, without a pause I said: “Twenty-five to .” My daughters were HORRIFIED.I’m nearly  and the idea of an older woman with a far younger man is deemed unthinkable and distasteful. Yet a handsome man marrying an adolescent girl is much more palatable.Well, I’m not having it. Don’t you dare give me the side eye when I walk with my future -year-old beau! OK, a girl’s gotta dream.A ROBUST, toned, muscled, strapping, athletic, sturdy, brawny, vigorous, rippedman has been parading up and down Oxford Street in London in his birthday suit with his plumbing shielded only by a feeble face mask. He’s making a point.I was wonderinghe’d like to come and make that point in my town.Because I also think I need to adjust his mask a little.Just want to be helpful.FIRST Dates TV maitre d’ Fred Sirieix is hopelessly in love with his fiancée and has revealed he is having the best sex of his le at . He puts it all down to the fact he has a greater overall wisdom at his age and that he likes himself more than when he was in his twenties.As a mature woman who recently had to kickstart her sex engine after some barren years, I agree there is much truth to feeling a bit wiser with age.Butwe’re really honest, it probably has nothing to do with our maturity and all to do with the connection you make and the person you’re with.It’s nothing you can find on an app, on paper or via social media.It’s just there when you meet.

It follows a route the Prophet Muhammad is said to have walked nearly , years ago and is believed to ultimately trace the footsteps of the prophets Ibrahim and Ismail.The demanding pilmigrage is intended to bring about greater humility and unity among Muslims.However, this year rather than praying shoulder-to-shoulder they are social distancing and moving in small groups of  to limit the potential transmission of the virus.Instead of dining together- which is tradition-pilgrims are eatingalone in their hotel rooms and praying at a distance from one another. For the first time in Saudi history, the government barred Muslims from entering the kingdom from abroad to perform the Hajj in order to limit exposure of the coronavirus.Two-thirds of those allowed to take part are foreign residents from among the  dferent nationalities that would have normally been represented at the Hajj. One-third are Saudi security personnel and medical staff.The pilgrims, who were selected after applying through an online portal, were required to be between the ages of  and , with no terminal illnesses and showing no symptoms of the virus. Preference was given to those who have not performed the Hajj before.Pilgrims were tested for the coronavirus, given wristbands that connect to their phones and monitor their movement and were required to quarantine ahead of todays start of the Hajj. During the religious event, women forgo makeup and perfume and wear loose-fitting clothing and a head covering in order to focus inwardly. Men dress in seamless, white garments to emphasise the equality of all Muslims and prevent wealthier pilgrims from donning more elaborate garments.During the first rites of Hajj, Muslims circle the Kaaba - the square building at the centre of the Grand Mosque - counter-clockwise seven times while reciting supplications to God.They then walk between two hills where Ibrahims we, Hagar, is believed to have run as she searched for water for her dying son.This year, pilgrims will only be able to drink water from this Zamzam well that is packaged in plastic bottles.

People have been asked to work from home where possible, avoid unnecessary travel, and socially distance. The government also banned gatherings of more than  people, banned visits to nursing home, and closed secondary schools and universities. Primary schools have stayed open, in part to ensure more healthcare workers could continue going to work. At the peak of the outbreak, the country was seeing , cases of coronavirus diagnosed per day, but that figure has now fallen into double digits. There has been speculation that the lighter-touch approach will allow Swedens population to develop herd immunity, but the extent to which recovered coronavirus patients enjoy immunity remains uncertain. Speaking to reporters in Stockholm on Tuesday, Tegnell said: The curves go down, and the curves over the seriously ill begin to be very close to zero. As a whole, it is very positive.He also addressed the question of face masks, which the World Health Organisation continues to recommend people use when social distancing isnt practicable. “With numbers diminishing very quickly in Sweden, we see no point in wearing a face mask in Sweden, not even on public transport,” he said.Swedens death toll, currently ,, has been high in comparison to neighbouring countries of a similar size. None of Denmark, Norway, or Finland, each with a population roughly half that of Sweden, have seen their tolls rise above ,. Many of the European countries that have begun to reopen their borders to foreign visitors are still yet to allow entry to people travelling from Sweden. The countrys healthcare system also initially struggled to cope with the impact of the virus, with  people at one point being admitted to intensive care every day, though that figure has now fallen to only a handful of people each week. In cases per capita, Sweden now has a similar rate of infection to the UK, and its government has argued that its strategy will be easier to maintain in the long-term. Speaking to Euronews this week, Jan Albert, a professor of infectious disease control at the Karolinska Institute and the author of a recent study on coronavirus in Sweden, said that the issue of herd immunity remained a big unknown. There are so many unknown factors about how many actually develop antibodies and other types of immune responses after going through the disease, and how many will be required to have had the disease in order to see herd immunity, he said. Speaking to Unherd about his countrys response last week, Tegnell said: “It is better to have a more complete discussion around this in say  months, after next summer. Then I think we can more fairly judge what has been good in some countries and bad in other countries.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is very important people with symptoms self-isolate and get a test, which will allow contact tracing.Evidence, although still limited, has strengthened and shows that people with COVID- who are mildly ill and are recovering have a low but real possibility of infectiousness between  and  days after illness onset.We have considered how best to target interventions to reduce risk to the general population and consider that at this point in the epidemic, with widespread and rapid testing available and considering the relaxation of other measures, it is now the correct balance of risk to extend the self-isolation period from  to  days for those in the community who have symptoms or a positive test result.This will help provide additional protection to others in the community.This is particularly important to protect those who have been shielding and in advance of the autumn and winter when we may see increased community transmission.Sir Patrick Vallance, the governments chief scientic officer, met with Boris Johnson and Cabinet ministers on Monday to discuss the plans.The Prime Minister is said to be extremely concerned by new outbreaks bubbling up, both at home and abroad.Sir Patrick told the PM he is concerned Britain is two to three weeks behind Spain in terms of the spread of infections, The Times reports.Travellers ing to the UK from Luxembourg and Belgium are among those that will see new quarantine measures imposed as cases spike in Europe, The Sun revealed last night.Ministers are said to be exploring ways to cut the quarantine time for ing travellers from  days to  too.Mr Hancock confirmed work was under way on it, but insisted it wasnt ready yet.He told Sky: Were always looking at how we can have the least-possible burden of the measures that we have to put into place so that is something on which were doing some work but well only come forward with a proposal when were confident that it is safe to do so.It comes after local outbreaks across the UK, including in Oldham, Wrexham and Staffordshire.

The new polling carried out by YouGov for Shelter, revealed parents living in privately rented homes are almost twice as likely to be worried about homelessness than parents living in secure social homes. The charity has warned that a chronic lack of social housing is leaving families with few options to escape the insecurity of private renting as the economic lockdown continues to ease, according to a new report. Shelter Chief Exec Polly Neate: “Families are going hungry and taking on risky debt to pay private rent, and yet for too many even these sacrices won’t be enough to avoid homelessness. These parents need a way out of living hand to mouth, but so far, the government has offered them no alternative to private renting.  This must changewe are ever going to build this country back better. Around one in seven respondents said they had cut back on food in recent months to help pay their rent, and one in five had taken on debt, such as an overdraft or payday loan. David Renard, Local Government Association housing spokesman, commented:Councils have serious concerns about the risk of homelessness many private renters face as a result of the coronavirus crisis. We are clear that building , social homes a year must form a central part of the national recovery. To give further protection to private tenants, the Government should also bring forward its pledge to end aposno-fault evictionsapos and commit to maintaining local housing allowance rates at the lowest third of market rents, so that tenants have greater security and households can meet their housing costs.

This requires everyone to follow the guidance on social distancing and face coverings. But there is also a responsibility on the Government to protect the public. The key to successfully easing the lockdown without risking a second wave is to have a ing test and trace system. We know from South Korea, Germany and Singapore that effective testing is crucialwe want to contain levels of infections. That way we can get people back to work, children back to school and society back to near normal as soon as possible. Despite Boris Johnson’s claim to have a world-beating system, NHS Test and Trace is still not fully operational. Test results take too long and the number of people reached has fallen since launch.

Scientists say the effect of lockdown is waning as hotspots of coronavirus infection hit many northern towns. It comes after the Government ordered anyone arriving from countries deemed high-risk to quarantine to stop them triggering new outbreaks. Oldham, Greater Manchester, has overtaken Leicester as the area with the second highest infection rate in England. The town had . cases for every , people in the seven days to July . Leicester’s has dropped to . and the Government is today expected to review its guidance on the lockdown imposed in late June.Blackburn with Darwen, Lancs, now has the highest infection rate in England, at . cases per ,. Restrictions have been imposed in Rochdale and Stockport, both in Gtr Manchester, and Wrexham, North Wales, due to new spikes. Wrexham currently has % of all Welsh infections the Army has been brought in to run Covid- testing centres. Prof Jose Vazquez-Boland, chair of infectious diseases at Edinburgh University, said: “We are facing a comeback of community transmission after removing the lockdown measures. The efficacy of lockdowns is only temporary. There will be a resurgence of new cases every time social restriction measures are lted as long as the virus remains in circulation.” Cambridge University’s MRC Biostatistics Unit estimates there are around , new infections a day in the UK. It put the R reproductive rate at near  in most regions. One expert saidinfection rates are not lowered we could face a second wave. Prof James Naismith. director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford. said: “I fearwe fail to check this flare-up, we will head into winter with a high level of ­circulating virus. “With normal winter illnesses such as flu, we could see ato exponential growth in cases that overwhelms the NHS and requires complete lockdown. We have only a short time to get our systems ready to prevent this.” New NHS Test and Trace data will be released today but so far the system has only been reaching around a third of symptomatic cases. Confirmed cases are still low but increases were recorded each day last week for the first time since April.  Local authorities complain they are not getting detailed enough testing data in time to take action. Experts warn that a series of new spikes is likely till a vaccine is rolled out or regular, widespread testing is in place. Officials in Oldham have pleaded with people to follow new restrictions. Justin Brierley, , runs a shoe shop in the town’s market. He said: “Business is poor as it is, so it’s very worrying that cases are rising again. We’ve done everything we can to abide by the social distancing measures. I’m not confident I can rebuild my business for a second time.” Experts are calling for better sick pay and laws preventing staff being penalised for taking time off. Delayed test results also mean many contacts of those who test positive are not being told to self-isolate fast enough. Prof Naismith added: “The Government intervention that will make the most dference in keeping the lid on this flare-up is the isolation of positive cases. Not enough effort has been put into measures [like] financial support.” One in  Brits, or .% of the population, has been infected with Covid-, a study shows. UK Biobank tested more than , people for antibodies, which indicate past infection. Blackburn Darwen  In Blackburn and Darwen residents have been told to limit the number of people from the same household visiting another household to just two. The council also wants masks to be worn in enclosed public spaces, including shops, workplaces, libraries, museums, health centres, hair and beauty salons. And it said handshakes should be replaced with bumping elbows. Oldham  In Oldham , residents have been told to keep visitors away from their homes. And they are also being urged to maintain a strict two metre social distance when they leave the house. Care homes are not allowing visitors and those people who are “shielding” will also be asked to continue to do so for another two weeks from Friday. Leicester In Leicester in late June non-essential shops were asked to close, just two weeks after they had re-opened. Bars and restaurants did not open on July  as planned and the government advised against all but essential travel. Restrictions have been eased in some areas and the government is expected to announce a review of its advice on Thursday. Rochdale  Rochdale council told residents to wear masks a week before the government’s own guidance. It also advised people to use them in all public places, not just shops. The council said no more than two people should be allowed to visit private homes and it advised against any physical contact with people outside the household. Stockport  Stockport council has issued a reminder of the ‘key steps’ to stop the spread of the virus. These include keeping two metres apart from people outside the home and having a test as soon as people suffer symptoms, no matter how mild.

This follows fresh outbreaks in Spain and other countries, with signs suggesting the arrival of a second wave in continental Europe. Meanwhile Brits ing from Spain were suddenly and without warning told to quarantine for  days, in an announcement at the weekend.And Professor Kirby says we could be right to be worried, as he held a conference for doctors and top experts to discuss what has been learnt about Covid- since it took hold in Europe. And he warned that younger people could be more at risk as the virus changes in the second wave. While Covid- affected mainly older people, ethnic minorities and those with underlying health conditions, younger people could be more at risk, in an echo of a previous pandemic.The  Spanish Flu pandemic claimed the lives of  million people across the world.It broke out in March  and mainly affected the elderly and infirm during the First World War. By August , it was hoped the pandemic was coming to an end, but the death spiked again in September to November. But the virus had developed into a new strain, and this hit young, healthy people. Speaking on BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Prof Kirby said: The winter is coming and almost certainly a second wave of this virus is coming.  What we saw in  was the virus change and the second wave was dferent from the first wave and it affected a dferent group of people - particularly younger people. Pandemic experts fear Covid- could go through a similar aposW curveapos as the Spanish Flu - the deadliest pandemic in history. The Spanish Flu first saw a aposU curveapos - two major spikes in deaths among the very old and very young. But this became a aposW curveapos - as death rates spiked among healthy  to -year-olds.Doctors in America are also said to fear death trends will be similar to those documented in the Spanish Flu, NY reports.Dr. Raul Vasquez, CEO of the Greater Buffalo United Accountable Healthcare Network, told the news site that the Spanish Flu came in three waves, with the aposU curveapos representing the first two waves. But in the final wave, the curve on the graph became a W shape as a third demographic of those aged  to -years-old saw disproportionate deaths, and not just the old or very young. In the Spanish Flu pandemic, it was all over by the summer of . The brutal reality then was that everyone who had caught the virus had either been killed, or had developed immunity to it. Retired Surgeon Prof Kirby also said obesity was a massive problem and overweight people are at higher risk of the second wave. He said: We do have a massive problem with weight in this country and we do need to address it. A message that came from this conference to patients all over the world isyou want to protect yourself against the second wave that is coming down the track then getting fit and losing weight is absolutely crucial.

The -year-old motorcyclist was killed in a road crash in August last year, and has since been the subject of an international row. His mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn said they had decided to scatter his ashes in Weymouth, Dorset, where the Dunns took their annual family holidays. The teen was last in his favourite town in July  and Mrs Charles described today as the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives. Mrs Charles and Mr Dunn, alongside their partners Bruce and Tracey and other extended family members, travelled down to say goodbye to Harry.Mrs Charles said that although it will feel like they are setting him free, the fighting will continue to get US suspect Anne Sacoolas back to the UK. Askedher sonaposs funeral provided any closure, Mrs Charles said: No, and we were really numb back then - very much a bunch of zombies, to put it mildly. We donapost remember a lot about the first few weeks at all. Obviously weaposve been through so much since then - weaposve been to hell and back on many, many occasions. Weaposre not numb any more, we just hurt all day every day. The hurt is there constantly and it never, ever goes away. But now,  months on, today is going to be the hardest day weaposve ever had to face in our lives, and I canapost imagine it getting any harder. You shouldnapost have to scatter your own childaposs ashes. Mr Dunn said he hoped the family could have peace after scattering the ashes. Asked why they picked Weymouth, he said: From a very early age, Tracey and I first came with Harry and Niall to Weymouth on our first family holiday back in , and every year we would come back on the same week. It became a tradition, and as we know poor Harry died last year and today is exactly the last day he was here - he came for a night with his friends... so itaposs a year to the day since he was last in Weymouth and weaposre here to scatter his ashes and let him ride free.Mrs Charles added: We can rest assured that heaposs definitely out there riding the skies and going everywhere that he wants to go. Weaposve found a beautul spot where we are going to take him and weaposre sure that the wind will carry his ashes and the waves will be splashing up on the rocks to help him travel too. So weaposll feel like weaposve set him free. Commenting on what is next for the family, Mrs Charles said: Proper closure. Which is to make sure that Anne Sacoolas goes through the UK justice system. That has to happen. You and I would have had to have done it - in my view she is no dferent. So we will keep fighting - today is going to be extremely tough, but the determination never wavers, ever. It doesnapost matter what today takes out of us, tomorrow will be yet another day of fighting. Today is just for us but the fighting will continue.

Police Scotland and Scottish SPCA have launched an investigation into the incident filmed by a fellow driver near Lochgelly in Fe, Scotland. The short clip shows the lurcher-type dog running just inches from the car’s spinning wheels before getting a fright and attempting to run away.The sickening act has sparked fury amongst animal lovers including local dog walking company GeoPaw, reports the Daily Record. A spokesperson said: “I almost cannot believe what I’m seeing. “This may look funny to some folk but going by comments from those who have seen the video the dog was absolutely terried. “It’s also extremely dangerous and just the height of stupidity. It’s unbelievable that any human can treat animals like this in this day and age. It’s just sickening.”  A spokesperson for the Scottish SPCA said the matter had not been reported to it, but that Police Scotland would act as the lead agency for any investigation. Officers have confirmed that an investigation is underway after the incident was reported to them.They added that an officer was sent to the scene - known locally as the stock car road - but the offending driver and vehicle could not be traced. Some dog owners suggested police should be treating the incident with greater urgency since the vehicle’s number plate was clearly visible. Dog owner Jenner Sterritt said: “I’ve seen time and time again, people complaining about all types of animal abuse, but they are letting the animals down big time.” The incident comes amid concerns about the treatment of greyhounds or other dogs used for racing across parts of Europe.

The immortal bird has stunned diners at the KFC in Blackpool, Lancashire, where it has been feasting on scraps of chips and chicken since the end of May. It seems unfazed by the cm arrow pierced through the middle of it. Despite it attracting the attention of worried customers who want to take it to the vet, the plucky gull, which is still able to fly, has so far evaded capture. Residents of the seaside resort are now living in fear the thug who shot the poor gull may strike again and calling on visitors to be vigilant. Blackpool-based property developer, Mark Leech, , first captured the bird on camera at the end of May during a trip to KFC with his family. The dad-of-two said: “I was very alarmed when I first saw the seagull. “The injury looked le-threatening to such a small animal. “I tried to lure it over with a chip to catch it and take it to the vets, but it wouldn’t take the bait.  “If there was a big cage with some food in there, I think it could be caught. “What’s disturbing is there’s someone out there willing to shoot innocent animals. “It makes you think – who will be next ” The seagull is thought to have been shot straight on with the cm arrow, the feather end of which is sticking out near the bird’s head. Mark said that several people had contacted the RSPCA about the injured seagull but so far no one had come to rescue it."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle frustrating call palace","story":"NewsMeghan Markle got frustrating call from Palace after necklace got her into hot waterMeghan Markle wore a simple gold necklace when she popped out in  - but it resulted in a dficult phone call with her then-boyfriends staff at Kensington PalaceShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am video paul-burrell-says-harry-meghan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markle-frustrating-call-palace-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

They claim that Meghan was upset by the call, saying that she said very little while on the phone, instead choosing instead to simply listen to the counsel. They write: But after hanging up, she felt frustrated and emotional. While she knew the aide had good intentions, the surreal experience of having someone from her boyfriendaposs office tell her what kind of jewelry to wear or not to smile at a photographer was too much.  They said she felt distraught, and damnedshe did, and damnedshe didnapost. Meghan reportedly discussed the incident with a friend, saying: I canapost win. They make out like Iaposm to blame for these pictures, that it looks like Iaposm encouraging them, that me even acknowledging the cameras may not be sending the right message. I donapost know what to say. It was only yesterday that people online were saying I look miserable in pictures, because I was trying to just ignore the [photographer]. The necklace is the latest in a number of claims to emerge from the book, which will be released next month. It discusses a reported fallout between Harry and William, saying the Duke of Sussex was angered by what he perceived as his brotheraposs snobbish attitude to his bride. Harry was offended by Williamaposs unwanted advice to take as much time as you need to get to know this girl, it is alleged. It also claims that things were tough between Kate and Meghan, saying the strain was evident at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day last year. “While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word,” write the authors. Tensions peaked at their final joint engagement, the Commonwealth service at Westminster, in March. It’s claimed: “although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her”. The book also features details of the coupleaposs first date and the night news of their relationship was leaked. They write: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours.

Ebony Gooding, , her sister Tamara, , and cousin Rosie Trumpet, , have told how they were ganged up on by the youngsters while a five-year-old boy screamed racist abuse. The trio of childrenaposs entertainers had been booked to play at a garden party for a four-year-old.Ebony told the Sun that the children immediately began punching and kicking them.The women were dressed as the characters Marshall, Chase and Sky from the popular Channel  cartoon show, but Rosieaposs Chase costume was knocked off her by the childrenaposs blows. Ebony says five children took hold of her and pulled down on the head of her Sky costume. She was unable to see and was easily pushed around by the mob before one of the children took hold a microphone and racial slurs were repeatedly shouted, they claim.Ebony said: “We kept doing crying gestures to get them to calm down. No one was controlling them and they were just being allowed to attack us.” The women fled but parents closed the gates to stop them getting to their car, telling them they were not going to be getting out of the site. Demands were made by the parents of the boy whose birthday they had been booked to perform at. They wanted the £ deposit back - the trio intending to charge £ in total, money they have yet to receive - and the women were warned by another adult present that the dad was a complete lunatic so they should do as he asked.  The friends called the  emergency number and a massive police presence descended on the site near Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire. Ebony said there were at least eight police officers, three riot vans and three police cars. The petried woman added: It was surreal and felt so over the top for a four-year-old’s birthday party but I can understand why they did not want to take any chances.

Rochdale is already under harsher lockdown restrictions than other areas of the country as part of the governmentaposs local lockdown strategy. Residents are still observing the two-metre social distancing rule - instead of one-metre plus - and are limited to two visitors per home. People are also being urged to wear face masks outside and not just in enclosed spaces. Testing has been extended in the town so residents who are not even showing symptoms can now get a test.

I was only there for two years but we have stayed in touch ever since.“The more that I worked with him, you could see he thinks about the game a lot.“Sometimes when you play, you do your own thing and go home. You don’t really think about the game.“But I think he studied it a wee bit more and I saw that the longer I was with him,# added the Tannadice number two.“His accent is still broader than mine and he has been down there for years.“Seriously, coming here is a great opportunity for me and I am delighted he gave me the call.“I actually spoke to Micky a lot and I met him just before lockdown, paying him a visit at Tranmere.“I knew his ideas and thoughts on the game and I was up here last week speaking to him as well.“I am getting to know what he wants. At times our ideas might dfer but his are the ideas that matter so it is up to me along with the rest of the guys to get that message onto the players as best we can.”LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign\" title\"#LEE WILKIE: Coronavirus effect for Dundee United may be survival this season, then kick on in the next campaign# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp lee-wilkie-dundee-united-fc-micky-mellon embed # secretzkvLKPr\" data-secret\"zkvLKPr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

In fact, you can say that about the whole summer.Thankfully, this weekend we’re back to talking about controversy on the pitch instead – for the top flight clubs anyway.I’m delighted Dundee United fans will get to see their team in the Premiership this weekend, evenonly virtually.For Dundee fans, I feel your pain – the Championship kick off still feels a long way away.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

This isn’t just a football problem, it’s a pandemic right across the world.“For our players to take a wage cut it has helped the club out and we are very appreciative to them for doing that. To a man, they have done their bit to help the football club going forward.“I think we’ll see a greater togetherness in terms of the fans as well as they will appreciate it. Everybody here that entered the process took the cut so the fans will be behind us from day one knowing that. If they can get back in the ground, I think the place will be bouncing anyway as they have missed football but I think this adds to it as well.“Of course we have still got to perform because what the fans want the most is to see a successful team. The sacrices the players and staff members made has helped the football club.“I think now there is a buy in to Dundee Football Club, as they have accepted it, you just get that feeling.”The Dens gaffer revealed his players, despite still being on furlough, have been putting in the hard hours on their own over the shutdown.He added: “They are just desperate to get back to being out on the pitch. We had a good end to the season, prematurely unfortunately but we’ll remember that.“They are on furlough so have an optional programme, they put their times up and we can see they are working very hard.”On joining the  Foundation, the former Dens skipper said: “I think it’s a great idea and wanted to be a part of it.“The response from the fans has been fantastic in these dficult times.“Signing up to the foundation and buying season tickets will really help the club as a whole and our fans’ response so far has been excellent and I’m sure it will continue to be.”The scheme has already topped the  mark with members able to sign up for monthly payments of £, £, £ or £ with all money going directly to the club.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He was interested in others which is why he enjoyed teaching.#He was also passionate about the carbon footprint we are leaving future generations and he stopped flying  years ago.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary.

There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Instead, they were directed at some national policies and how they impacted on rural development.Argyll and Bute Council had been #more than helpful# to local businesses in the recovery from lockdown, the company added.Mr MacLeod also suggested Scottish Water should be encouraged to allow small developments to be served by inidual septic tanks or bio-discs.In addition, the provision of water and electricity to remote rural locations should be subsidised by the Scottish Government, he added, which would help make projects more affordable.Furthermore, the cost of #impact studies# should not fall on the developer, he said.Another issue was the requirement of registered social landlords that housing is built to extremely high specications, he said.Mr MacLeod said: #That high standard does, of course, ensure the houses are well insulated and easily maintained. The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

You think Harry Potters magic  Just look around you.\"That curiosity is our biggest asset because thats how we learn to adapt, thats how we learn to survive, thats how we learn to cope with the world around us as it changes.\"Lloyd, who previously worked as a Sunday Timesjournalist, was inspired to begin a career as a childrens author after seeing the joy his children experienced when they learnt new things during their years in home-schooling.Particularly that of one of his daughters who was astonished to learn all about Antarctica ndash home of her then favourite animal, the penguin.\"I believe fundamentally, especially now having done thousands of talks in schools and festivals over the last  years, that humans generally reach peak curiosity at the age of nine or ,\" Lloyd said.\"Then things start to get in the way, like puberty and your friendship groups change and going from primary to secondary school.\"But at the age of nine or  youve got that purity of curiosity where youre old enough to know that you have an identity and youre curious enough to want to know where you fit in.\"Theres nothing you cant talk to a nine or -year-old about ndash provided you dont patronise them, provided you dont have an expectation of them that they cant meet.\"If you can meet them as fellow kindred spirits on this rock travelling around the sun, in this incredible galaxy, and here we are, face to face, learning about it and discovering things together, then there is nothing more inspiring than engaging with a nine or -year-old.\"Chris Lloyds Humanimalbook event will be broadcast on Sunday, July  at am as part of the festivals Family Series, and will include a discussion portion after a short presentation by Lloyd.The event is suitable for families with children aged

It was a rosy starling!The beautul rosy starlinglooks nothing like the starlings we know. It strongly resembles a magpiewith a much shorter tail.This species is unmistakable in its adult plumage. The male has a pale pink body with a black head, wings, and tail. Additionally, during the breeding season the male develops a wispy crest and the black colour becomes glossier with a purplish green or blue sheen.The female is less vibrant than the male. Both sexes appear much duller outside of their breeding season.Furthermore, the rosy starling does not mimic other species, unlike its well-known cousin.What the two species have in common is murmuration ndash an astonishing and mesmerising aerial spectacle large flocks of these birds gather and perform a real show as they swoop, e and swirl across the sky in beautul shape-shting clouds. It is a phenomenon that pleases the eye of every observer.The rosy starlingrsquos breeding area stretches from the Balkans and Turkey to Central Asia and north-west China. It spends winters in India and south-east Arabia. As a strongly migratory species, it can travel outside of its normal breeding range. As a result, there are signicant periodic summer and autumn influxes in western Europe. The causes of such irruptions are not yet fully understood however, it appears to be related to changes in the population of locusts on which the birds feed.Imagine my amazement when I read that one of those birds had landed and made its temporary home in someonersquos garden in Port Seton!The cherry on the cake was that the night when I saw the first images of the rosy starling in East Lothian, I also received an email from Stuart Payne ndash the lucky host of the rosy starling. Stuart invited me to his garden.The next morning, my fianceacute Chris and I rushed to Port Seton. As we were walking towards Stuartrsquos house, we saw another birder looking around hoping to spot the rosy starling. As soon as we arrived at Stuartrsquos house, I saw this magnicent pink bird flying past the house and landing on the bird feeder to start its feast.Stuart and his we Gillian welcomed us in their garden, where I spent half an hour photographing the gorgeous rosy starling and chatting to Stuart and Gillian. I also took some time to admire their beautul dogs Hugo and Hobbes.

It is a fantastic museum and project that tells the story of the arearsquos extensive industrial history, including of the Tranent-Cockenzie Waggonway, built in  and associated with the coal and salt industries.Nearby sits Cockenzie House, a mansion and gardens dating from the th century. It is now home to a brilliant wee cafe and numerous craft businesses well worth a visit.In between Longniddry and Port Seton sits Seton Colligate Church, considered ldquoone of the finest medieval collegiate churches in Scotland. It was built in the late s by landowner Lord Seton so the community of priests could pray for his familyrsquos salvation.Finally on the coast there is Longniddry Bents, East Lothian largest tourist attraction.

Credit: Jevelin Getty ImagesAnything that rubs against your face for hours on end is bound to cause some irritationmdashand face masks are no dferent. lsquoWhen it comes to cloth or surgical masks, we are primarily seeing mild skin irritation, mild comedones , and reactions to the fabric itselfrsquo, Allie McAllister, BSN, FNP-C, DCNP, explains. lsquoWhile just wearing a mask can cause friction which can be irritating to the skin, the types of materials, dyes, and detergents in the mask can also cause irritation and rashesrsquo.Besides rashes and chafing, face masks can also lead to breakouts. It makes sense when you think about itmdashyour mask is creating a moist, warm environment against your skin, which is perfect for bacteria to thrive. lsquoBreakouts can occur from sweat, dirt, and moisture being trapped under the maskrsquo, McAllister says.How to protect your skin from your face maskAlways start with a clean face. Credit: Getty ImagesFor starters, McAllister says you should always thoroughly wash your face before you put on your mask and after you take it off Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser in particular because its gentle and non-irritating. Then, McAllister recommends, lsquoIf you know yoursquoll be wearing your mask for a long period of time I would suggest applying a thin layer of Aquaphor Healing Ointment to the areas that will come in direct contact with the mask.rsquoYou can also try an anti-chafing balm, like Body Glide which is is a favourite of Reviewed staffers who run. Apply it on areas where your mask typically rubs against your skin, like the nose, cheeks, chin, or ears.Keep in mind, too you should wash your face mask regularly in the laundrymdashand McAllister agrees. She suggests using a detergent specically for sensitive skin thats free of any dyes or perfumes.Bonus: If you have the luxury of picking and choosing your mask , McAllister says the type of fabric can make a big dference in your masks comfort. She recommends a soft cotton fabric thats more breathable than other alternatives.McAllister says once again to start with Aquaphoryou notice any irritation or discomfort. However, she advises that you speak to a dermatologistthe irritation is more severe or does not resolve with Aquaphor.And as for breakouts, our lestyle writer and beauty guru Jessica Kasparian has a few products she swears by. lsquoIf a blemish pops up, I love the Mario Badescu Drying Lotion, which uses isopropyl alcohol to dry up pimples and calamine lotion to soothersquo, she says, adding, lsquoI also love hydrocolloid patches like the CosRX Acne Pimple Master Patch set.

Large tents and large groups are not wild camping. On Saturday, July , Tyninghame alone had  tents.ldquoOf these,  were camping illegally. That equated to roughly  people camping and thatrsquos  people who will need to go to the toilet on a sitewith no facilities.Issues have moved from litter to irresponsible fires and human faeces being left behind.They noted  ldquoirresponsible fires at Tyninghame.They added: ldquoIt is illegal tohave a fire in a woodland and a ring of stones is not responsible, nor would it prevent a fire from spreading.ldquoStones have been known to heat up and explode!

Wild camping has been enjoyed for years and enjoyed by those wanting to get closer to our land.ldquoBut whilst access to the land runs deep it must not be abused.ldquoFarmers have rights most especially, but so does our natural environment, which is there to be cherished not trashed.ldquoThose enjoying the outdoors must respect the right to do that or face consequences.ldquoPublic agencies are under pressure but enforcement is necessary.ldquoWe all have a duty to call this behaviour out.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media. On one side you have those who seem to relish the lockdown, the class swots who shout too loudly about how they follow every part of the guidanceand seem to revel in the idea of a second wave. On the other side, you have the virus deniers. Both groups peddle fear and misinformation, whether that is their intention or not.At the end of the day none of us, not even the scientists, know whether and when there will be another wave of the virus. Uncertainty permeates through every part of our lives now, and we must find ways to live with and even embrace thiswe are to make it through the tough months ahead.

Those that belong to the pea and bean familyfor example, in summer, can store nitrogen in their roots,that can be ploughed back into the earth.Which crops make good green manures At this time of year they include mustard, fodder radish, fenugreek, buckwheat and phacelia, which can be slotted in in six to eight week gaps when the ground is cleared between crops. Some sown in early autumn, including winter beans, grazing rye and winter tares, will last through the winter and can be dug into the soil when it warms up in spring.How long do they take to grow Some, such as mustard, are fast-germinating. Two weeks after sowing youll find the ground covered with small seedlings, and after six weeks, these can be chopped and folded into the soil to add nutrients.Fenugreek is another nitrogen-fixer for summer, really fast growing and its bushy plants are great for suppressing weeds. It can be planted in late spring or summer and grown for up to three months.When do I cut them down Chop the fast-growing ones when you need the ground back. Just dig them up, chopping up the leaves and stems as you go to speed up decomposition. Leave them a few days to wilt and then dig them into the soil.Longer term crops such as alfalfa, red clover and trefoil can be left in the ground for a year and clipped from time to time to stop them from going woody. They are ideal for soil thats been overused and needs to rest.What benefits do they provide Clover, fenugreek, winter beans and alfalfa are good nitrogen-fixers, storing nitrogen in their roots, while clover and phacelia flowers are a magnet for beneficial insects, which can help pollinate crops, so leave some to flower. Italian ryegrass and buckwheat have root systems that will help break up heavy ground.When can I plant crops in the space again A few weeks after youve dug in your green manure, you can sow late crops such as onion and garlic.WhatI want to wait If you have no crops to fill the space, cover the green manure-treated bed with cardboard or landscape fabric to keep the nutrients from the green manure in, which will give you a great seedbed to sow seeds in come spring.What  can I grow to help my crops Try growing comfrey, which absorbs nutrients and minerals and can be made into a liquid feed. Just cut it down to the ground, fill a bucket with the leaves and stems of the plant, packing them in tightly and then filling the bucket with water.Set it aside for three weeks , then strain off the liquid into a container with a tight lid. When you want to feed your plants, dilute the liquid with water at a ratio of around : and feed your plants weekly into autumn."},{"url":null,"title":"food-chef-tom-kerridge-shares-passion-bbqs","story":"Barbecues at the ready because chef Tom Kerridge, holder of two Michelin stars, has a trove of summertime cooking treats to share.During the course of his new show, Tom Kerridge Barbecues - on the Food Network, the chef will be showing off some old and new recipes using charcoal, smoke and fire.He talks about his favourite dish from the series and why everyone - including professional chefs - are prone to barbecue disasters from time to time.How did this series come about \"I filmed with Food Network last year, a big series for the States, they gave me a call and said listen do you want to do something with barbecues... it was actually a really good, fun thing to do.

It is not yet clear how often that sampling will be conducted.Mr Swinney has said the enhanced testing regime would be run in conjunction with the current test-and-protect system, which covers the entire population and was launched in May.Scotlandrsquos health secretary, Jeane Freeman announced on May  that all , care home staff would be offered weekly tests to help cut infections in homes, the site of around half of Scotlandrsquos Covid deaths. But the Scottish Government have since been beset with problems in addressing that.Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens education spokesman raised concerns about the direction for schools saying that what is planned is not regular testingand will not be offered to every teacher and older pupil ans believes teachers should get the same protection as footballers.ldquoRegular testing has proven to signicantly reduce transmission of the virus, precisely because it involves testing those who are not symptomatic. We now know enough about this virus to say that many infectious people show no symptoms, but containing the spread is dependent on identying and directing them to self-isolate,\" he said.ldquoTeachers and support staff are anxious about ing to crowded schools where pupils are not required to socially distance. The Scottish Greens proposed regular testing a month ago to offer them some reassurance. If footballers can be tested regularly, teachers deserve the right level of protection as well.A survey by the NASUWT teachers union Teachersrsquo Union published earlier this month revealed that nearly half of teachers who responded did not feel prepared toto their school or college in August and just % said they feel safe or very safe as a result of the provisions their employer was putting in place to mitigate the risks of Covid-.Ross Greer.The survey, which examined the experiences of over  teachers in Scotland during the lockdown and in preparing for wider reopening from the start of the new academic year in August, found concerns about a lack of PPE and adequate safety measures to protect staff and pupils in schools and colleges.Larry Flanagan, general secretary of Scotlands largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland , said: ldquoMany teachers will be concerned about their personal safetyschools reopen in August with a full pupil . One of the reassurances which the EIS has sought from the Scottish Government is a comprehensive approach to testing which proactively monitors schools and facilitates swt intervention where risks arise. That is what we expect to be delivered.:Coronavirus - Swinney sets out plan for full-time schools in colossal U turnMr Swinney told MSPs earlier this week that the testing that will be provided will \"ensure we are properly and fully monitoring any changes in patterns that may emerge as a consequence of the re-opening of schools.\"He has referred to the plan as a \"layer of surveillance testing that will be available within our schools to enable us to have a reassurance that there is an effective approach being undertaken to identied any changing pattern of Covid and enable us to take action accordingly should that arise\".He added: \"If there are positive cases identied within schools, there will have to be the wider contact tracing work that is undertaken and follow-up action as a consequence. And schools will be required to be in touch with public health authorities should such circumstances arise.\"It has also been revealed that the guidance for schools makes clear that two confirmed positive cases in a school within a -day period would be defined as an official incident.Mr Swinney talked of arrangements ontesting and positive cases in schools after being quizzed about details descirbed by one MSP asstill vague and addinganxiety in school communities.Shetland Islands MSP Beatrice Wishart MSP raisedprotocols in New Zealand, where a school or early learning service that has one confirmed or probable case of Covid- must close for  hours to allow contact tracing and then, potentially, for a further  days.He said: \"The answer to that question has to be set within the general context of what is becoming increasingly obvious, which is that the test and protect approach in Scotland is very effective, as we have seen vividly in a couple of examples in Dumfries and Galloway and, more recently, in Lanarkshire, where inidual positive cases have been identied and the test and protect arrangements have come into play.\"Contact tracing is undertaken and iniduals are required to isolate. In those examples, we have seen clear evidence that the tracing system is working effectively to follow up contacts. That would be no dferent in an educational setting from what it would be in any other setting in our society.\"He said that on a daily basis, when information arises about positive cases, health protection teams around the country seek information about connections between those cases in order that they can identy possible clustering of activity.In response the Scottish Government produced a statement saying: ldquoGuidance agreed by the Education Recovery Group on the health mitigations and precautions that will be in place when schools re-open will be published [on Thursday]. Testing will be a vital part of those mitigations and, as always, we will be guided by the best and most up to date scientic evidence.The test-and-protect programme asks those with coronavirus symptoms to provide details of ldquoall recent close contacts to a team of NHS contact tracers. Contact tracers will contact the people who have been in close contact with an infected person, and then ask them to self-isolate for  days."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amThis week#s edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

They are also being reminded that there is local support available to them should they find themselves to be the victims of the issue.NFU Scotland Orkney#s regional policy advisor Kerry Omand said: “If anyone finds themselves to be in this unfortunate position there are key steps that they need to take and responsibilities that livestock owners have. I believe that the public are very aware of their rights and responsibilities as dog owners, and our members need to have the same knowledge and confidence in dealing with these situations.”The legislation relating to this is the DogsAct  and #worrying# is defined as attacking livestock, chasing livestock in such a way as may reasonably be expected to cause injury or suffering to the livestock or abortion as well as being at large, not otherwise under close control or on a lead, in a field or enclosure where there are livestock.Kerry highlighted: “There is often an assumption that an attack or incident must be physical for it to be taken seriously, and that is simply not the case as signicant harm can be caused to animals without any direct contact occurring.”If farmers come across an incident of livestock worrying they should contact the police on the incident is ongoing, or dial  to report the incident, try to contain the dogpossible and gather their livestock for treatment and or retain any dead livestock as evidence. Finally, a dog must only be shot as a last resortthey cannot be contained and this should be reported to the police within  hours.Kerry added: “I completely empathise with members who find themselves in this situation, having been the victim of livestock worrying myself. This was a few years ago now, but from that experience I would encourage farmers to gather evidencethey can, in the form of photos or videos of the incident occurring. That may seem like an unnatural thing to do when you are wanting to put an end to the incident as quickly as possible, but it also crucial to have this evidence to hand.”Mark Evans, animal welfare officer with Orkney Islands Council wants to remind dog owners to ensure that their dogs are always under control and avoid going into fields where livestock are grazing.He said“If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land then the owner and or the person in charge of the dog, is guilty of a criminal offence.”Mark reiterates “Farmers should make every effort to catch the dogit is worrying livestock and it is only as a last resort to shoot the dogit is not able to be caught. This needs to be reported to the Police and to the Councils Trading Standards Service.”Orkney preventions and interventions officer with Police Scotland, Constable Simon Hay said: “The worrying of livestock can have devastating consequences for farm animals and has an obvious financial and emotional impact on farmers and their businesses.“The advice to dog owners or anyone walking and exercising their dogs in the countryside is to ensure they are under control at all times and avoid going into fields where livestock is grazing. The Scottish Outdoor Access Code says dogs should not be taken into fields where there are lambs or other young farm animals.#Police Scotland will enforce the existing legislation robustly, ensuring all reported cases of sheep worrying are thoroughly investigated and offenders reported to the Procurator Fiscal. Farmers and those who use the countryside are urged to report all incidents of livestock worrying to police on  or  in an emergency.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

According to NHS Orkney#s interim chief executive, Michael Dickson, this is because the new positive test was conducted by an industrial lab which had not been validated by the NHS.The inidual, who is not currently in Orkney — but has been in the county during the past week — has been asked to self-isolated. This person will be immediately re-tested by the nearest NHS veried lab — the Lighthouse Lab in Glasgow.  In the meantime, NHS Orkney will be tracing iniduals that the person in question has come into signicant contact with.It should be confirmed within the next three days whether this is indeed a new test-positive case — the tenth for Orkney,so.Mr Dickson said: #A number of industries use labs to undertake COVID swab tests and this labs are not validated by the NHS.#We can#t be confident that,the same test had been done in an NHS lab, it would have achieved the same result.#The interim chief executive, who is the permanent chief executive for NHS Shetland, explained that there had been a similar issue with a possible case within his home board. He added that, like in Shetland, he would be working to see whether some industries which have been testing their staff for the virus could do so through an NHS veried lab.#What we do is presume the person is positive,# Mr Dickson continued.#We kick in all the our well-rehearsed contact-tracing mechanisms and we instruct the person to self-isolate where they are.#When this happened in Shetland, the second test came back negative. It#s dficult, but we have to err by the side of caution.#Mr Dickson said that he understood that there would be an element of anxiety around this new possible case, and advised that all those who have come into signicant contact with the inidual in question will be contacted and asked to self-isolate for  days. If a contact is in a high risk category, a decision may be taken to immediately test them for coronavirus.#If you do not receive a call from our contact tracing team, then basically you#ve not been in signicant contact with this inidual,# the interim chief executive said.It is not knownthis case will be included in NHS Orkney’s positive COVID cases as the original lab is not an NHS facility.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing! The colour and vibrancy has helped to lighten the mood of everybody in the village and those travelling through it.When in the area look out for the horse and all the displays andyou want to learn more about the work of the Cullybackey Community Partnership, ring Joanne on .

His previous work has focused on tackling the educational underachievement of black and Caribbean heritage children in England.He said targeted intervention in schools was one effective way to close the gap between poverty and under-achievement.Peter Weir said the new  would pave the way for a properly resourced action plan allowing education to be a le-changer for all children.Cregagh Primary School principal David Heggarty hosted the meeting, and called on the  to work for a better partnership between schools, family and communities.It is my hope... as a primary school principal of six years and as a former pupil of this very same school, raised by single parent in a low income home and reliant on free school meals, that a very wide and very foundational view of tackling educational underachievement is needed.

Two, David Hilditch and Trevor Clarke, denied it represented a challenge to Mrs Foster but said they would make no further comment on their reasons for abstaining.Thomas Buchanan said he had no comment to make while the remaining eight abstaining MLAs - Alex Easton, Paula Bradley, Joanne Bunting, Jonathan Buckley, Paul Frew, William Humphrey, and former ministers Mervyn Storey and Michelle McIlveen - have yet to respond.The controversial bill gives ministers more inidual powers, and was eventually passed by  votes to , with  abstentions.The rebellion from DUP MLAs followed warnings from former First Minister Peter Robinson#s adviser Richard Bullick, who said it would effectively remove the DUP#s ability to veto decisions it disagreed with. He claimed the DUP was sleepwalking into making profound constitutional amendments and shedding gains negotiated in the  St Andrews Agreement.He said he was concerned about the danger of the DUP rebellion being interpreted as a challenge to Mrs Foster#s authority, but it turns on a few moving parts. These issues are more grey than some current arguments suggest, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseThe DUP’s Thomas Buchanan FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappThe DUP’s Thomas BuchananRadio Ulster#s Nolan Show reported that senior DUP figures had urged Mrs Foster to pause the bill, including MPs Sammy Wilson and Jeffrey Donaldson as well as former MP Nigel Dodds.A DUP statement has since called the bill a very technical piece of legislation, which was the subject of considerable legal input from senior government lawyers.It added: Bills would not normally be accelerated but in recognition some members would have like more time to debate this bill we relaxed our whip on the matter.The new law was introduced following a court judgment two years ago, which overturned the Executive#s approval for a waste incinerator near Mallusk.Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said he regretted that the Assembly had passed poor and badly thought-out legislation.The fact that the Junior Ministers admitted that no changes in planning, which this Bill was supposedly about, can be enacted until the revised ministerial code is brought before the Assembly in either the autumn or early winter, shows that not only was there ample time to give this bill proper consideration, but also that the flaws highlighted in this process re-emphasise that no lessons have been learnt since RHI, he said.While we did not manage to defeat the bill, the fact that some DUP MLAs chose to abstain in person shows the considerable disquiet that there is across much of the Assembly in this process. I fear that the flaws in this bill could haunt us for many years to come.Sinn Fein junior minister Declan Kearney denied the legislation would allow ministers to go on #solo runs# and said it was necessary to progress key planning decisions.

They say masks will make it impossible for the children to lip read what their teachers and friends are saying.

Penny lost her hearing when she was a year-and-a-half but we didn#t know until her speech failed to develop, Lissa explained. With her speech delayed, she had her implants fitted last year so she had already lost quite a lot of development time, and then her nursery was closed for months due to the lockdown. It will be challenging enough for Penny entering school in terms of communication on top of all of this uncertainty around the virus. I#m concerned but I still want her to thrive as best she can and she needs an educational setting to do that. While Penny has the implants she still doesn#t hear everything, so she relies on facial expressions and lip reading to piece together what#s being said just like a jigsaw puzzle.

He relies completely on lip reading and sign language to communicate. Obviously he has missed out on speech therapy, which he would have got in school over the past few months but for the lockdown. My main concern is getting Emmett back into school because he has missed out on so much and home schooling has been very hard over recent months due to his speech and developmental issues.He was in hospital recently and the staff had to wear face coverings, but at times he couldn#t understand what they were saying, as they cause mumbling. If this was the case in schools he and his friends who also have implants will have real problems communicatingthey can#t see each other properly.

But it#s not the same as seeing them in the flesh. However, I am determined to keep pressing ahead with my efforts to get Liz and her mum over here.Liz was born in Vietnam in November last year and I set about planning to bring her and her mum here.However, the global pandemic is playing havoc with his dream.He added: Not only were there the health concerns about coronavirus and travelling, but there#s now also a backlog everywhere you turn, whether it be for visas or passports.There#s a lot of red tape but the authorities in Dublin have assured me they are going to do everything they can.I was hoping my partner and my daughter could be here by Christmas.But, realistically, I don#t think it#s going to happen before .It#s really frustrating. I am watching Liz grow up on Skype but I know I#m missing out on seeing her getting bigger every day. It was in April  that Vance was evacuated as part of Operation Babylt from Saigon and he came to live in Northern Ireland, where he was adopted by Cyril and Liz McElhinney, who raised him along with their two other sons David and Stephen.In  they supported histo the country of his birth in a bid to find his biological parents and a BBC NI documentary team followed him. Although he discovered the orphanage where he had lived, he was unable to trace his family.However, after he came back he started to receive messages on social media from people who claimed they were his relations and knew his widowed mother.I was worried that it might all be a hoax, said Vance.But when he went back to Vietnam on a scheduled trip he was introduced to a woman called Le Thi Anh, who insisted she was his mother.I was gobsmacked, and DNA testing later established that I was indeed her son, he added.Around the same time he met and fell in love with a woman called Le Hang.He said: I met Le through a charity that I set up to help disabled and orphaned children in Vietnam. She came on a visit to see the work that we were doing for the youngsters and we hit it off quickly.Though I couldn#t speak Vietnamese we communicated through French and we also used a translation site on the internet.I#ve been back to Vietnam and we realised we wanted to be together. We got engaged in  and in November last year Le had our baby. We#re now planning to get married in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.Vance and his partner called the baby Liz after his adoptive mother, who was a well-known cleric in Lurgan and who died nearly three years ago from motor neurone disease.Vance is still coming to terms with another familial shock after he found out he has a half-sister in Australia who he knew nothing about. A few months ago I got a call from a woman Down Under who said she was my half-sister and DNA tests have borne out her claims. But it#s been a real surprise to cope with, though we#ve been in contact a few times, said resourceful Vance, who has recently been celebrating the success of an invention aimed at dog lovers.His dog dock, which allows pet owners to secure their animals safely outside shops, has been bought by around  businesses, particularly around Lurgan, where it can be found attached to exterior walls at service stations and cafes.He explained: I#ve been working on the dog dock for four years now. I always thought it was a hassle that I couldn#t find somewhere to tie up my late Staffordshire bull terrier Keltic when I went into shops and my brother David suggested that I should come up with a device to get round the problem.I drew up plans for a fairly crude first prototype and got it made up in a factory in Vietnam. Invest NI gave him a development grant of £, and a design engineer at a college in Portadown came up with a more sophisticated model for the dog dock, which was then manufactured in a local engineering factory.The first dog dock, which costs £, went up outside a supermarket in Waringstown. Although he#s happy that the feedback from businesses and even caravan owners has been positive, he says the pandemic has restricted his ability to market his invention properly.I#ve now applied to the TV show Dragons# Den to seeI can get a slot on the programme and find an investor there, Vance added.

Throughout the crisis we have continued to draw down mortgages and are currently lending up to % loan to value.As a responsible lender we consider a range of factors to assess the affordability of the mortgage in the long-term. At this time we are not accepting mortgage applications from customers who are on furlough but we will keep this under review.Nationwide Building Society said it will consider applications from people who have been furloughed but added those on furlough are not eligible for the society#s recently launched % loan to value first-time buyer mortgages.Bank of Ireland said: We are lending to customers who are furloughed. We#ll ask customers to provide some information about the terms of the furlough during the application process.Lender AIB said: All our lending is based on the customer#s ability to repay. This is to protect the customer from undue risk. Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.Ulster Bank said it was “strongly committed to lending to all kinds of mortgage borrowers - this includes those on furlough and those ing from furlough”.“As always, they base lending decisions on affordability and ability to repay and they take each case on an inidual basis.”A spokeswoman for Progressive Building Society said it is “a responsible lender and reviews and assesses every case on an inidual basis including the income and expenditure of all applicants”.HSBC said it will not lend to furloughed workers whoseto work date is further than three months away or there is nodate at all.Mortgage broker and advisor London  Country said: “Mortgage lenders have sought to support those on furlough through the lockdown period and in the main have continued to accept furloughed income when considering how much they can offer to borrowers. “That would of course often mean a reduced income and consequent reduction in the size of borrowing available but at least most lenders would be able to consider lending.  “As we move closer to the unwinding of the jobs retention scheme borrowers should expect to see more questions aboutto work and some lenders are now stipulating that they will want some confirmation. “Getting employer confirmation may not be possible for all at this stage but on the upside those that can, may be able to use theirto work income for the affordability assessment.  “That approach will be consistent whether for first time buyers or next time buyers as lenders will need to be able to demonstrate that the mortgage is affordable and will remain sustainable. “However the market is still light on deals for those with small deposits which is often a bigger issue for first time buyers and some of the lenders that have ed to the % LTV market will potentially set a higher expectation when it comes to credit score.”Belfast Most ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Sacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Nora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportUnbowed, unbroken and no regrets: DUP#s Campbell says Irish remarks showed republican leadership #in worst possible light#Unbowed, unbroken and no regrets: DUP#s Campbell says Irish remarks showed republican leadership #in worst possible light#,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The teenager#s body was discovered on August  beside a small stream about .km from the resort.Although her family believe there was a criminal element to what happened, police have said there was no sign the -year-old was abducted or raped.A preliminary post-mortem examination showed she succumbed to intestinal bleeding due to starvation and stress.An inquest into her death is due to begin on August  and last until September .Denis Barror, the Dublin-based solicitor acting for Meabh and her French father Sebastien, declined to comment on the proceedings.Ms Brennan denied defaming the couple and said she was surprised that they were taking a case. I will be defending myself. I don#t believe they have a cause of action against me, she said.Ms Brennan said that while she wrote very extreme things on the social media , she believed them to be true. Facebook declined to comment.Ms Brennan is a former partner in a Dublin law firm, and specialised in employment and equality law. She retired in  due to an illness.She confirmed her Facebook account was suspended for  days last September but was reinstated and remains active.The case is the second set of proceedings initiated by the Quoirin family since the tragedy occurred. They are also suing the owner of the resort for alleged negligence.Confirming details of that case last January, Sankara Nair, a lawyer for Nora#s parents, said the family strongly believed she was abducted as she had mental and physical disabilities and could not have wandered off on her own.The lawsuit alleges a cottage window was found ajar, with its latch broken, on the morning she disappeared.It is also claimed the resort gate was left open without any security and there was no surveillance camera except for the reception area.According to the claim, Nora had poor motor skills and needed help to walk. Although in her mid-teens, her mental age was about five or six years.Mr Sankara said the resort was not safe for Nora and that anybody could have come in and taken her. In an interview with RTE News last December, Meabh and Sebastian Quoirin said they were determined to get truth and justice.I think we will seek justice in so far as we can. We have to find peace in our own hearts, said Meabh Quoirin.We will carry Nora with us forever. She#s with us here every day. I talk to her every day. She holds my hand. We hear her. We see her in all that we do at home.

He began an address to the Assembly with Curry my yoghurt can coca coalyer.He was aping the Irish go raibh maith agat, Ceann Comhairle, which translates as thank you, Speaker and is used by some MLAs in the chamber.Mr Campbell refused to apologise for his words in  and was criticised by then Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin for a breach of standards.He later joked about the comment at a DUP conference that year. He opened his conference speech saying it was always good to start the day with a healthy breakfast while holding a carton of yoghurt.In the aftermath of his comments the then Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams caused offence when talking about the Trojan horse in the republican strategy for outreach to people on the basis of equality and how that was the way to break these bastards.The point is to actually break these bastards - that#s the point. And what#s going to break them is equality. That#s what#s going to break them - equality.Who could be afraid of equality  Who could be afraid of treating somebody the way you want to be treated Mr Adams was apparently answering a question about Sinn Fein#s relationship with the DUP in the light of Gregory Campbell#s disparaging comments about the Irish language.He later apologised for using offensive language, insisting he was not referring to unionists.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappSinn Fein challenged the DUP to act on Mr Gregory#s latest comments.Despite repeated requests, the party did not respond.Belfast Most ReadSacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Sacking of Dunnes manager #who ate food worth £ was justied#Nora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsNora Quoirin#s parents to sue Dublin lawyer and Facebook over social media postsRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeRevealed: The NI restaurants offering discounts under Covid- support schemeDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportDUP#s Donaldson, Wilson and Dodds intervened before backbench rebellion over bill - reportTributes paid after death of Holywood surgeon Kyle McDonaldTributes paid after death of Holywood surgeon Kyle McDonald,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge.

Conor McGintys latest single Home To The Heartland recently topped the iTunes World Music Chart and has won praise from some of the citys most famous sons and daughters. After being sent a preview of the song footballer James McClean described it as brilliant, while Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson said it was a soulful and heartfelt tribute to Derry.This is without doubt the proudest I have been about any song I have ever released or recorded and to make it even more special I wrote the song myself, said Conor.I penned this song as a modern day Derry anthem along with the exquisite musical skills of Eamonn Karran.It has a Celtic pop twist to it and people seem to really like it.“Home To The Heartland” is written from the perspective of a Derry emigrant ing home and mentions many local landmarks such as Shipquay Street and Ebrington.Conor had been due to marry his fiancee Aisling this year, but the wedding has now been cancelled twice due to lockdown.Writing this song is probably the only good thing to come out of lockdown for me, said Conor.Ashaving to cancel your wedding once wasn’t hard enough to take, having to do it for a second time two months later was even worse.I think this year will be remembered by so many as an absolute kick in the teeth for so many dferent reasons.Conor says entertainers are struggling to find work due to the current government restrictions. googletag.cmd.push Something needs to be done to prevent the arts and entertainment sector falling through itself in the next few months, he said.It provides work to so much more than just the singer or musician. We all have bills, we all need to find ways to make an income and there is only so much adaptation you can do. We are applying for jobs but when you have been a self employed musician for years it is hard to get your foot in the door anywhere that isn’t in the entertainment sector.Id like Stormount to please try and think outside the box - It has become desperate times for many. googletag.cmd.push We will look forward to our wedding next year in September but in the meantime it would be great to be able to go back to work and provide.Put a screen up in front of me while I sing for all I care!‘Home to the Heartland’ is currently available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Branch Library Manager, Koran Burns, said people were delighted toto the facility, which shut on March .

We have had a steady stream of visitors at the Central Library since it reopened and people have told us they feel very safe due to all the measures we have introduced. Staff are there to greet people as they come in the door and we have provided hand sanitiser. There are also screens at the desks and lots of customer signage. Any books that are ed will be stored for  hours before they are put back on the shelves. Customers are being asked to keep a social distance and limit their time on the computers or browsing for books to half an hour. There are also self service machines for borrowing books. In addition, all surfaces in the library will be regularly cleaned. We are asking customers to help us keep the computer stations clean by providing sanitising wipes to wipe them down before and after they use them, said Mrs Craig. Staff will also be carrying out a high level of cleaning in the library. Mrs Craig said the opening hours have also been changed to allow the library to close for  hoursbefore reopening on a Tuesday morning for vulnerable people.

Speaking to the County Derry Post, as part of the in-depth look at Ulster hurling, both referred to the competition being at its peak during the nineties when Down and Derry were challenging for titles. McCann, who expressed that Antrim would not have any aspirations of being part of the talked about Team Ulster concept, said the Saffrons would be mad keen for aof the Ulster senior hurling championship. The Creggan man is one of two or three to have ever played in the Ulster championship, but feels there would need to be a reward and spoke of how the automatic entry to the All-Ireland semi-finals now being a thing of the past. googletag.cmd.push “Id say we would be mad keen to get it back,” McCann said. “If there was some sort of reward for winning the Ulster championship, you would get a better buy-in from all the teams and when they removed that, it was a road to nowhere.” Down manager Sheehan had a dferent opinion on the need for qualication into the Liam McCarthy Cup to make the Ulster championshipviable. It would be a massive incentive, but felt that Derry and Down would not be at the level of Leinster or Munster and the Joe McDonagh Cup would be their level. googletag.cmd.push McCann felt that the new tiered championship has been really good for Antrim. Last years Joe McDonagh Cup threw up competitive games and their clash with Offaly was among the best games he has seen, but not enough were able to witness it.  Antrim senior hurling captain Conor McCann “It is a shame they are never on TV, the GAA never listen and never do anything about it. They show the odd game and I have no doubt the Christy Ring is the exact same. If the promotion was better, it would definitely help,” McCann stated. Sheehan said he would love to see aof the Ulster championship and its absence reflected poorly on the province. While he accepts Antrim would general win it, he points to Derry winning the last U final and beating Down in the final. “The reality is, an Ulster championship medal means something to people andAntrim felt they didnt want to partake in it, Derry, Down Armagh and the other teams would have an interest in playing in it...but clearly you want Antrim in it,” Sheehan said. The Newry Shamrocks man looked towards Derry or Down being in Division A next season and Antrims chance to be in Division , should they beat Kerry. “That a good for Ulster hurling. It is indicative of the fact there are good hurlers in the province and there are guys in the province who are passionate about it,” he added. Sheehan also mentioned the topic of dual counties trying to attract players to the hurling . “It is very hard to do that, when those lads can get provincial recognition playing in a provincial championship and get on the TV. Their chances of getting some kind of coverage is increased, yet we dont even have our own championship at any level – senior, minor or U. “I make no bones about this, I think the Ulster Council are reneging on their responsibilities by failing to have an Ulsterchampionship,” Sheehan adds. He also indicated how Derry and Down would love to get a crack at an Ulster title. References were made to the crowds at Slaughtneils recent games with Dunloy and Ballyhale. “We are being denied the opportunity to have a show-piece for Ulster hurling and I just think that is wrong. It is the very minimum the Ulster Council should be doing,” the Down boss pleaded. So when do you play it  “Fixtures is something you can always work your way around,” said Sheehan, who was the GPAs representative on the National Fixtures Committee setup by President John Horan last year. “Ideally, you would like to see it played in the summer. I dont know why, with the right kind of work, at the very least the first step could be taken where they could look to morph the McGurk Cup into the Ulster championship. “If we are playing in a pre-season competition, there is no reason why that cant be built up on. Either make it an Ulster championship or mirror it and give people summer hurling.” He doesnt buy into the scenario of clubs clashing with county in the summer. Sheehans solution is train with the county once a week. Give them back to their clubs but still play in the Ulster championship. “Nobody pays the players wages so no manager, club or county, should have exclusive rights to players,” Sheehan stressed. “Players want to be playing matches and managers shouldnt be stopping them from doing that.” Conor McCann agreed on a summer slot for the Ulster hurling championship, but it demanded more respect. “It should be having more of a stature, other things should be moving out of the way for it,” he stated. “We shouldnt be talking about squeezing the Ulster hurling championship in. You dont hear people talking about squeezing the Munster championship into the fixtures, do you ”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Former Foyle College pupil Katie Smith landed her dream job at innovative Belgravia eaterie Wild by Tart last year at just -years-old. But after seven months in her new position, the restaurant had to shut for lockdown and Katie had to to leave her glamorous London le behind and move back in with her parents on the Limavady Road. Katie always had ambitions to work in the food industry and went to study at the prestigious Ballymaloe private cookery school in Cork straight after leaving school at . googletag.cmd.push My parents were really supportive of my decision, but my twin sister Abbie took a dferent route and went to Edinburgh University to study French and Spanish so in a way I can see the le I might have had, she explained. Having a trained pastry chef in the house definitely has its advantages. Im the resident chef in the house and Im doing most of the lunches and dinners, but thankfully not the breakfasts, laughed Katie. Coming from a high pressure job to being temporarily out of work was a big change of pace for Katie and she decided to launch a cookery e-book to fill her time. googletag.cmd.push I loved my job and I was learning so much from the people I was working with and then all of a sudden Boris told people not to go to restaurants and the bookings just dried up, she recalled. I remember on the Wednesday we had to close and on the Thursday I came home. I didnt expect to be home as long as this to be honest, and I like to keep busy so I decided to do something dferent. I was doing recipe testing so I decided to make a recipe ebook with my sister and donate % of the profits to a social enterprise charity Luminary Bakery for disadvantaged women in London. After the success of the ebook Katie decided to launch a pop up bakery from her parents kitchen offering brownies, cookies and pastries for pick up or delivery. As much as I love being at home Im looking forward to when things go back to normal and I can progress my career, she added. Katies recipe ebook is available at www.brilliantbake To order from her pop up bakery email katie@gmail or visit her Brilliant Bake page on Facebook.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Moville resident Enda Craig has urged local representatives to wake up and finally end all confusion over the Lough. Mr Craig made the comments following a motion at last weeks monthly meeting of Donegal County Council, where the issue of unregulated oyster fishing was raised. At the meeting in Letterkenny, local councillor Terry Crossan highlighted the environmental and visual impact an estimated , oyster trestles is having on the Lough. The Muff-based councillor asked council officials to contact the Marine Minister to engage with his British counterparts to seek to resolve the jurisdictional issues. googletag.cmd.push However Mr Craig stated that there are no jurisdictional issues between Britain and Ireland as the Crown Estate owns the seabed of Lough Foyle. The lough has been a disputed area between Britain and Ireland since the formation of the Irish Free State in . “You cant claim jurisdiction over something you dont own, its that simple,” he told the Inish Times. The Crown Estate is a collection of lands and holdings within the UK belonging to the British monarch as a corporation. Mr Craig said that the issue of jurisdiction has been settled and that local representatives should recognise that fact. googletag.cmd.push “I know that local representatives deal with numerous issues on a daily basis so they may not understand fully that Ireland has no jurisdiction over the lough at all, but it is time that they waken up and stop claiming jurisdiction over something that they dont own.” He also highlighted the feeling of unequal treatment that traditional oyster fishermen have received over the ongoing unregulated farms dotted along the Lough Foyle coast. “The traditional wild oyster fishermen look on as oysters are being harvested in large numbers on trestles on the shoreline of Lough Foyle by fishermen who are not burdened with a licence fee.” He added: “Any attempt to resolve the issue of licensing on the sea-bed of Lough Foyle without firstly taking into account its ownership by the Crown Estates is putting the cart before the horse and is doomed to failure.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The CPA is of the view that the GAA needs to use its time to re-calibrate the season. When Coronavirus ceases to be a threat, the fixtures problem of our own creation will still be with us and will not have gone away, the CPA maintains. In a statement the CPA claimed that the current tug of war between club and county in the abridged season of  only proves that the governance of rules around designated periods is not working and the lack of clarity and enforcement of the existing rules is bringing embarrassment to the Association. googletag.cmd.push It added: The GAA is currently in the middle of a very dangerous atmosphere which needs to be addressed immediately and certainly in advance of . If a satisfactory set of fixtures cannot be agreed then this totally unnecessary and poisonous atmosphere will further escalate and damage our Association even further. The statement contends that the simple and unpalatable reality is that the GAA is in crisis. This crisis is four-fold. It then lists a number of areas of concern, namely: .Fixtures. .Finance. .A lack of central governance. . A loss of it’s’ sense of identity as a community based Gaelic Games and Culture organization with the club at its core. googletag.cmd.push The rest of the statement reads as follows: All four of the above are inextricably linked. middotThe crises in fixtures is one of the primary causes of the financial dficulties because the cost of team management at both club and inter-county levels is unsustainable. middotThe predominance of inter county activity has led to an erosion of the Associations core values as a community based Gaelic Games and Culture organization and to a diminution of the club games program. It has also led to the unnecessary ongoing friction between club and county over the availability of our elite players. middotA lack of proper governance structures means that there is no central control over the management of the national games program. National and provincial competitions have developed in piecemeal fashion and there has never been a strategic games plan. Local competitions structures y widely, devised and implemented by a wide range of administrations across the Association. Team managers are appointed without proper control over appointment procedures, work practices and remuneration.Rules, where they exist, are not being enforced. middotRegrettably, the perception of the GAA at national and provincial levels has become that of a corporate elitist organization which has income generation and a focus on a small elite of its top players at the core of its activities. Thus % of the playing membership gets priority to the detriment of the remaining %. As a result, inter county activity gets priority over the needs of the vast majority of our playing members. middotThere is widespread concern right across the ranks of ordinary GAA members that, unless immediate remedial action is taken, the Associations alleged corporate and elitist policy priorities will lead it on a reckless path towards a semi -professional or professional structure that will destroy its community, cultural and amateur values. If left unchecked, this will remove our valued infrastructure of county and parish boundaries, together with control over the movement of players. In such circumstances pride of place will be replaced by price of place. The Club Players Association now respectfully calls on the Leadership of the GAA at national level to do whatever it takes to resolve these issues amicably before . It’s high time to end this impasse which is doing so much damage to our Association.We believe the only viable solution is as follows: OslashDraft a national games program by designating periods to club, inter county and third level. OslashOnce the designated periods are agreed, design competitions to fit within those time windows. OslashSuch structures should be set out in a manner that will ensure that there will be no conflict for players between the ious groups. OslashCreate a clear set of central control structures to include the enforcement of existing rules, creating new rules where needed and strictly applying appropriate sanctions for breaches. OslashPublish the proposed plan to all clubs so that they may decide on the outcome. OslashTo ensure a truly democratic result, authorize the holding of a national referendum of all clubs under which clubs will hold General Meetings to decide the outcome. There is a clear precedent in place for this process from , when, with the authority of Congress, such a referendum was held to consider the deletion or retention of the foreign games ban. OslashCall a Special Congress, remotenecessary, before the end of  so that any agreed change may be implemented in time for . We ask that Central Council should rule, as is its authority under rule . TO , that there is full representation. The very future of the GAA which we all love is at stake. We are pleading with the Associations leadership at national level to take whatever remedial steps are necessary and with the utmost of urgency. As elected leadersand or paid executives,our leaders have been given the responsibility to lead. Leadership in this instance means taking immediate and urgent steps that will Fix the Fixtures, give the Association back to its grassroots members and restore the GAA to being a community based Gaelic Games and culture organization with the club at its core. We are today calling on the leadership of the Association to give clarity to their members within the next two weeks on how they plan to resolve the crisis we have outlined above andthey are prepared to take on board our suggested solution. And finally we are here to assist the Association in any way, at any time, in any place and at our own expense.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

First aid boxes at the station were also raided for bandages.Damage at the Loop  was discovered during a recent shunt to test rolling stock and carry out essential track maintenance, with the exercise taking place while visitors were banned from the railway due to lockdown restrictions.Railway officials have reported the incidents to police and have appealed to anyone who can assist officers with their enquiries to come forward.The recent incidents come after the coronavirus lockdown had a massive hit on the railwayrsquos finances.In an online post, officials appealed to young people to ldquoleavethem alone and stop trying to destroy the place, also asking parents do they know where their children are and what they are doing.The hard-working volunteers say they have enough on their plate without having to ldquosort out other peoplersquos mess, expressing concern about people walking along the railway lines which they are not allowed to do.Officials say the ldquostupidity of others is the reason why they hope the local community will support their fundraising appeal to help pay for better security as a bid for financial help from the Northern Ireland Executive proved unsuccessful.A recent bid for support from the Department of Communitiesrsquo Covid- Charities Fund to cover costs racked up to maintain the business which has been mothballed due to lockdown restrictions was unsuccessful.Officials fear that the railway will also miss out on securing a slice of a poundm fund for business start-ups and tourist attraction investment which was announced recently.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner recently wrote an open letter highlighting the railwayrsquos plight and its reluctance to ask for help in the current financial climate.He said coronavirus restrictions have had a ldquodevastating impact on the railwayrsquos operations and its restoration work.Mr Gardiner said the railway was likely to remain closed for the remainder of the year due to the restrictions around Covid-.He said that with no income for the rest of the year, the railway faced ldquomajor challenges.Mr Gardiner said given that the railwayrsquos final attempts at securing Covid- support funding from Stormont failed, it had reluctantly turned to its members and supporters to ask for help.He added: ldquoWe need to raise at least pound, this year just to keep the railway in a good condition and make some progress with essential projects.To date, the railwayrsquos appeal has raised pound,, with anyone interested in making a donation asked to visit www.facebook donate   or text RAIL plus the amount to  or visit www.downrail appeal.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Aarin’s lockdown farm project  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK boy has been enjoying lsquoThe Good Lersquo during the Covid- lockdown.Twelve year-old Aarin Rea has spent the past four months developing a miniature farm, complete with chickens, ducks, doves and even peacocks, in the garden of his Knochnashinna home.Hersquos also growing fruit and vegetables in his allotment and specially built greenhouse, and hersquos also planted apple trees.His family and neighbours will soon be able to share in an abundance of potatoes, cabbages, lettuces, carrots, scallions, broad beans, tomatoes, strawberries and apples, as well as a supply of fresh eggs.Aarinrsquos mum, Karin, says the miniature farm has helped bring the community together during the isolation of lockdown and has lted everyonersquos spirits.ldquoItrsquos all everyone has been talking about lately, she said. ldquoThey are always enquiring as to how the farm is coming along and Aarin couldnrsquot be any prouder at whathe has achieved over the last few months.ldquoAarin has been eager to get out every day to his little farm while he has been off school. He spent the good weather tending and watering his fruit vegetables both in the allotment and in the greenhouse, which his father, Anthony, built for him.Aarin is the proud owner of peacock chicks, which were hatched thanks to a tip from his grandfather, Leslie Rea, who told him to put golf balls underneath the peacocks to encourage them to lay eggs.Aarin, has since given his poultry flock some pretty ingenious names, and he now considers his ducks, James Pond and Quacky Chan, among some of his best friends.Then there are his favourite hens, Henner Lopez, Princess Laya and Fluffy, who are very happy to the strutting around.The newest arrivals are two doves, Holy and Spirit, which are housed in a newly-built dovecote and a turkey chick.However, Aarinrsquos favourite animal is his beloved Jack Russell, Lottie.Aarinrsquos farming skills have come a long way since be began growing potatoes in tubs.ldquoI sell my duck eggs to elderly neighbours who adore their distinct flavour.

That is absolutely essential.Campaigners added: ldquoThe historic underinvestment in the Ambulance Service has been widely known for years.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained. The iconic sweeping beam and rotation system must not be lost at the stroke of a pen and consigned to the pages of history.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11640860.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
