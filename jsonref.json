Thatcher was not scheduled to speak, Charles Moore explains, but the Tory hierarchy realised that her standing with the party membership meant that a brief appearance couldn’t be avoided. Yet the event did not go according to plan. For six minutes, the audience cheered, applauded, stamped, and chanted, “We want Maggie!” Her parliamentary assassins looked on miserably.It’s a great moment in a book full of them. But arguably it’s also a moment the Conservatives have been stuck in ever since. With their ever escalating hostility to the EU, their stubborn faith in free-market capitalism, their unease with urban and northern Britain and their yearning for a mighty leader, the Tories are still the party Thatcher largely created during her epic leadership from 1975 to 1990. Moore’s monumental official biography – three volumes, almost 3,000 pages, the books published at regular intervals since her death in 2013 – has played a significant part in maintaining Thatcherism’s hold over the party. All three books are measured in tone and have their critical passages but Moore is, at bottom, a believer. Near the end of this concluding volume, when he finally lets his hair down, he calls her “the greatest genius ever to direct the affairs of the United Kingdom”.Yet for non-believers this volume ought to be the most palatable, since it covers her declining years in government, from 1987 to 1990, and her often melancholy 23 years afterwards. It also appears with both conservatism and capitalism seemingly in crisis: even the Financial Times has started using the slogan “Capitalism: Time for a Reset”. Unlike Thatcher’s previous biographers, Moore has the chance to judge her against the troubled, unsustainable world she helped create.He begins with a beautifully balanced section on the ambiguousness of her position in 1987. On the one hand, she had just won her third successive general election, and by a landslide on the other, her ascendancy had lasted so long, by the impatient standards of British politics, that even close colleagues were tiring of her. Previously more flexible than her Iron Lady persona suggested – her first two terms as premier had been full of well-timed U-turns – during her third term Thatcher really did become rigid. She remained an adherent of the contentious economic doctrine of monetarism, despite its huge social costs and erratic benefits, while her chancellor, the clever, competitive Nigel Lawson, had moved on in his policy thinking.Similarly, during the late 80s, Thatcher became steadily more convinced that European integration was a project Britain should resist, almost regardless of how that resistance affected relations with our closest neighbours. Her foreign secretary Geoffrey Howe – once an ally, now increasingly alienated – disagreed. The two senior ministers began to plot against her, more aggressively, Moore suggests, than they were prepared to admit in their memoirs. Meanwhile, the Tory hierarchy and parliamentary party, which had never completely accepted that they should be led by a radical woman, watched closely for any sign that Thatcher’s performance or popularity was deteriorating.In 1989, around the tenth anniversary of her election as prime minister, the polls turned decisively against her and the Conservatives. Voters had tired of her abrasive, imperial style, and the damage her iconoclastic policies had done to the fabric of Britain. Meanwhile, like most ageing governments, hers had become “accident-prone”, as Moore pithily puts it, beset by increasingly visible splits, scandals and administrative errors. In 1990 Thatcher’s many internal enemies finally moved to unseat her.Moore conveys brilliantly the sense of the walls closing in: first slowly and erratically, with regular apparent reprieves for Thatcher, and then very fast. As her official biographer, and a famous journalist and rightwinger, he has had access to more verbal and written sources than probably any other historian of Thatcherism, and he uses them to build a Westminster drama that is compelling and emotionally raw despite the fact that many readers will know the key scenes already. Some parts have a novelistic quality rarely found in the careful pages of political biographies.Early on the morning of her last day in office, for example, her hairdresser Paul Allen realised that he had forgotten to bring a comb to 10 Downing Street. None of the staff there had one, and Thatcher was too distraught for him to ask her. So he decided to look for one surreptitiously in her official apartment. “The flat was, as usual, open,” Moore writes. “He crept upstairs and knocked softly on every door lest the prime minister should be behind it. She was not. Allen extracted the comb and fled downstairs.”Unfortunately for the book’s rhythm, the chapters covering the causes and details of her downfall are interrupted by a huge section about her foreign policy achievements. To an extent, this digression is probably unavoidable: abroad, Thatcher’s power and status peaked later than they did at home. Her telegenic persona, her sheer longevity as a leader, the spread of Thatcherite free-market policies around the world, and the end of the cold war – Moore suggests her rapport with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev played a key part – all gave her an almost impregnable international reputation by the end of the 80s. Moore even tries to burnish it further, by arguing that she was a pioneering voice against climate change, and an underestimated contributor to the ending of apartheid.The former chapter is more convincing than the latter. While Moore provides plenty of evidence that she helped the African National Congress (ANC) behind the scenes, he does not properly consider whether her public condemnation of the ANC as “a typical terrorist organisation” in 1987, or her loud opposition to the international campaign of sanctions against South Africa, helped prolong the apartheid government’s hold on power. Revealingly, according to Moore her “terrorist” speech against the ANC came after the organisation had warned it might attack British businesses in South Africa, in protest at her sanctions stance. For Thatcher, the interests of business nearly always came first.This was not just ideological. A scientist by training, she “was instinctively happier with matters that could be quantified”, Moore writes – with the seemingly hard data of profit rather than with the fuzzier outlines of social trends. This is a crucial point about Thatcherism. She was often incurious about, or actively hostile to, the huge changes afoot in social values in late 20th century Britain, regarding sexuality, race and non-economic personal freedoms. So her social policies lost their attractiveness to many voters long before her free-market ones did.Yet having highlighted her fogeyishness, Moore – perhaps because he is a bit of a fogey himself – does not explore its implications. For all the awesome scale and thoroughness of his trilogy, over 20 years in the researching and writing, the shifting social texture of Britain under Thatcher is largely missing. Without it, the books fall short of being definitive. Thatcher fell, and the still-Thatcherite Tory party has struggled since, not just because of political plots and personalities – grippingly portrayed here though they are – but because Thatcherism gradually stopped offering dreams and solutions to ordinary Britons.Another disappointment is this volume’s treatment of her life after Downing Street. Almost a quarter of a century is wrapped up in fewer than 120 pages, and with few revelations. Herself Alone is a sad, suggestive title, but the book’s intention is signalled more accurately by its cover: a flatteringly unlined and commanding portrait of Thatcher taken in 1991, before her decline really set in, by the celebrity photographer of dominant women Helmut Newton. Thatcherism, the book implies, remains as full of potential as ever. Moore criticises her governing tone as insensitive and isive, but not the substance of what her governments did. A comparison of the Britain she promised and the country we have actually lived in since is not something this book dares to offer.Instead, we get a few concluding insights into Thatcher as a person. They are all sharp, and often make her seem more sympathetic. Perhaps the best of all is this: “Mrs Thatcher combined an immense assurance about following her own way with a permanent uneasiness in life.” She created an uneasy country for the rest of us to live in.• Margaret Thatcher: Volume Three is published by Allen Lane (£35).

More than 100 new jobs will be based at the company’s Sunderland headquarters with the rest in shops across the UK.The company said that in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of Thomas Cook, Britain’s oldest travel firm, it offered to help all Thomas Cook apprentices to complete their training at the Ofsted-accredited Hays Travel Academy.“We will build on the good things Thomas Cook had – not least its people – and that will put us in even better stead for the future,” said Irene Hays. “We want to continue to build the company’s reputation for first-class service and being a great place to work and develop a career.”John Hays opened the first branch of the eponymous travel company at the back of his mother’s childrenswear shop in Seaham, County Durham, in 1980. Sales in the first year amounted to £812. Since then the business has grown to more than 190 travel shops across the UK, employing about 1,900 staff with a turnover of more than £1bn last year. To mark the £1bn milestone the company shared a £1m pot with its employees, who each received £100 for every year they had worked at the company.“I’m very proud of the fantastic team who have helped me build Hays Travel over almost 40 years and they have worked tirelessly over the last couple of weeks to bring this about.” he said. “It is a game-changer for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/469eb4ab75d6cf85daec99d570e61b37b4c396a8/434_287_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a734651a7e46f3785024688bbac828d3","title":"zantac in global recall over unacceptable levels of potential carcinogen","story":"Heartburn medicine pulled by GlaxoSmithKline while it investigates source of impurityGlaxoSmithKline is recalling the popular heartburn medicine Zantac in all markets, days after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found “unacceptable” levels of probable cancer-causing impurity in the drug.Zantac, also sold generically as ranitidine, is the latest drug in which cancer-causing impurities have been found. Regulators have been recalling some blood pressure and heart failure medicines since last year.Britain’s medicines watchdog said GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) was recalling four prescription-only Zantac medicines – a syrup, an injection and tablets of 150mg and 300mg dosages – over an potential carcinogen called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)Over-the-counter 75mg dosage Zantac products are produced by a different company and are not affected by the recall, it added.GSK was continuing with investigations into the potential source of the NDMA, he said.The impurity was believed to have been introduced by changes in the manufacturing process.The MHRA said healthcare professionals were told on Monday to stop supplying the products immediately, quarantine all remaining stock and return it to their supplier.“We are advising that patients should not stop taking their medication, and do not need to see their doctor until their next routine appointment but should seek their doctor’s advice if they have any concerns,” the MHRA said.US and European health regulators said last month they were reviewing the safety of ranitidine, after online pharmacy Valisure flagged the impurities.The FDA said Valisure’s higher-temperature testing method generated very high levels of NDMA from the ranitidine drugs.NDMA had previously been found in some blood pressure medicines from a class of drugs known as angiotensin II receptor blockers, or ARBs.The US regulator has asked ranitidine makers to conduct their own testing to assess levels of the impurity and to send samples of their products for testing by the agency. Swiss drugmaker Novartis halted global distribution of its ranitidine drugs last month.Last week, Walmart joined pharmacy chains CVS Health Corp, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and Rite Aid Corp in suspending the sale of over-the-counter heartburn drugs containing ranitidine.Canada’s health authorities have asked makers of the drugs to halt distribution as they gather more information. Last month, regulators in Hong Kong pulled four products, while in Ireland 13 products containing ranitidine were recalled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b45785530853eed3ba430149b04b18f397c34d35/50_0_2269_1361/master/2269.jpg?width=1140\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ab65b3294b8c7b10b3a159ce8d5f5054 2280w","title":"the guardian view on faltering brexit talks a no deal election is on the cards","story":"The blame game has begun after a No 10 briefing of an Angela Merkel phone call. A public row serves the government’s purposeIn Berlin, a government spokesman refused to comment on the Merkel-Johnson phone call. In Brussels, officials said they did not recognise the comments attributed to Ms Merkel as EU policy. The European council president, Donald Tusk, was more forthright, tweeting directly to the prime minister: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Whatever was actually said, this crunch week of negotiations has morphed into precisely that, because of Downing Street’s decision to brief in such incendiary fashion. It will be hard to row back from here, as evidence mounts that a breakdown in negotiations is something Mr Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, are ready to actively seek, as long as they can pin it on the perfidy of the EU. The truth is that the government probably still wants a deal, not least to avoid the chaotic and dangerous consequences that its own plan, Operation Yellowhammer, identified. But its “two borders for four years” plan – requiring single-market checks between Britain and Northern Ireland, and customs checks on the island of Ireland – is almost certainly not going to be the basis for one. As has been made clear from the outset of negotiations, the EU will not countenance the physical infrastructure that would necessarily accompany such checks in Ireland, creating a de facto border and undermining the Good Friday agreement.Given this reality, Mr Johnson may be refocusing on what has been his overwhelming priority all along: winning a general election. If negotiations break down, Mr Johnson is obliged by the Benn act to seek an extension to the 31 October deadline. In any subsequent election, he will need to convince furious leave voters that it wasn’t his fault he failed to deliver. It may well serve this purpose for the meltdown to be as acrimonious as possible, with the EU, as well as parliament, in the dock. That would allow an election to be fought on a no-deal platform, neutralising the threat from Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in the expectation that the remain vote will stay split.On Tuesday night parliament was again prorogued – lawfully on this occasion – ahead of the Queen’s speech next week. When it reconvenes on Monday, it will still be true that a majority in the House of Commons opposes no deal. It will still be true that a no-deal Brexit on 31 October is illegal. If talks on a deal do collapse this week, MPs must ensure that parliamentary sovereignty over the process is upheld. That is the first task. But given Tuesday’s developments, which once again revealed this government’s dangerous disregard for the national interest, that seems likely to be only the beginning of the battle to prevent no deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48205f60c3e5f8224c41c6b1cab3c71725fe974e/0_300_5811_3488/master/5811.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8de91736e2d29d6a1aa84444269a1be","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of hypnotic","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘hypnotic’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘hypnotic’.Share your photos of what hypnotic means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 9 October at 10am.

The university has said it is aware of their concerns and is reviewing the terms and conditions of all its outsourced staff.The letter to Arthur points out that as outsourced workers, UCL’s cleaners, porters and security officers, who are predominantly BAME migrant workers, are entitled to only the bare minimum sick pay, holiday leave and pension rights, far inferior to those enjoyed by staff who are directly employed.“This two-tier system is deeply unjust and it is hugely disappointing that UCL has maintained this system of exploitation for so long,” the letter states. “This situation is unacceptable at UCL, which prides itself as a global institution and one of Britain’s leading universities.”The strike is part of a wider and ongoing campaign led by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to end outsourcing. There have been previous strikes by cleaners and security staff employed by the University of London (UoL) – of which UCL is a member institution – and earlier this year there was a boycott of Senate House, the UoL’s administrative centre.According to IWGB, while direct employees can receive up to 26 weeks’ pay if they are off sick, outsourced workers receive no pay on the first three days they are off sick, after which they are entitled to £94.25 a week. As a result, many workers choose to work while sick rather than risk losing pay.Ciaca Carvalho, a UCL porter for 11 years, said: “We are forced to work even if we are not fit to work. We come to work just so we can eat. We work in the same building – we deserve to get the same benefits as everyone else.”A UCL spokesperson later insisted that all the university’s contractors are required to pay the London living wage. “In consultation with our recognised union, Unison, we are reviewing the current arrangements for the employment terms and conditions of our outsourced staff.“They are a valued part of UCL’s community and we are listening to concerns that have been raised regarding their employment status. Senior leaders met with frontline Unison representatives this week and we will continue to do so.”Maritza Castillo Calle, a former UCL cleaner who chairs the IWGB UoL branch, said: “UCL would not be able to function without its cleaners, porters and security officers. However, for years the university and its contractors have been happy to treat them like second-class workers.“We gave UCL a clear deadline by which to present a plan to end outsourcing, which it failed to abide by. Now we are left with no option but to strike.”The result of the strike ballot will be known on 5 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a9888de9e947203b509c837bd4aa9b5eaadd15b/0_82_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9198564666aef7f20b459190e11fb263","title":"labour pledges to create 70000 more jobs in offshore windfarms corbyn","story":"Corbyn commits to 37 new windfarms in green industrial revolution election pushJeremy Corbyn will unveil plans to create another 70,000 jobs in offshore windfarms part-owned by the public as his party gears up for an election manifesto focusing on a green industrial revolution.The Labour leader will visit a windfarm on Wednesday as he launches his commitment to a further 37 offshore windfarms.They would be built with a mixture of public and private finance as Labour members voted for stringent targets of net-zero emissions by 2030 at their autumn conference.Under the party’s 10-year plan, the UK’s capacity for wind energy would increase by fivefold and benefit from an £83bn investment.Before the visit, Corbyn said: “The full scale of the environment and climate emergency cannot be ignored. As scientists and activists have made clear, we need immediate and radical action to have any hope of keeping temperature rises to a manageable level.“We know the big polluters and banks won’t take the necessary action. So the next Labour government will kick-start a green industrial revolution, protecting our planet and creating hundreds of thousands of high-wage, high-skill unionised jobs across the country and delivering investment for communities that have been held back for decades.“Labour’s 10-year plan will provide the massive public investment needed to radically reduce our emissions and secure a future for our planet.”Labour said the finance model would be joint-venture partnerships between publicly owned Regional Energy Agencies (REAs) and existing offshore wind developers.The Conservatives questioned why private investors would want to put money into windfarms part-owned by the government.Kwasi Kwarteng, a business minister, said: “Why would any investor put money into a nationalised windfarm? While Labour joins disruptive protests, it’s Boris Johnson and the Conservatives who have outlined practical steps to achieve our world-leading net-zero target, including delivering a major increase in offshore wind at record low prices, expanding electric vehicle use and making all new homes energy efficient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2220f6376f76c8c8b4578a18ce220536d70a6955/423_218_4201_2521/master/4201.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1194a6cea1d44551ed8b5aabaa77e508","title":"royal society of biology photographer of the year the shortlist","story":"The RSB has unveiled the shortlist for its 2019 photographer of the year and young photographer of the year competition.

It’s a cliche that sounds pretty cruel applied to Parasite, Bong Joon-ho’s brilliant, insidious twist on the home-invasion thriller, in which a frostily modernist luxury house serves as several different things to different people – a status symbol, a shelter, a prison – but doesn’t offer homely comforts to anyone, exactly. Yet it’s true, in a funny way, for Bong himself. A globally minded film-maker with big-dreaming genre nous, he has spent the last few years making a bid for mainstream Hollywood clout, only to finally make an international phenomenon from his own doorstep.Bong’s last two films, 2013’s Snowpiercer and 2017’s Okja, were his first to be made in English: they weren’t exactly misfires, either critically or commercially, yet both clearly had designs on being bigger deals than they were. Adapted from a comic book, with brawny Marvel man Chris Evans in the lead, Snowpiercer was a delirious dystopian adventure that merged Bong’s auteurist eccentricity with bolshy blockbuster aspirations: it raked in over $82m outside the US, double its production budget (at $40m, then a record for a Korean production).In the States, however, its bullet-train momentum was halted by the ignoble figure of Harvey Weinstein, as Bong joined the long line of directors to fight “Harvey Scissorhands” over the film’s final edit. The director refused to follow Weinstein’s proposed cuts and additions the impasse delayed the film’s American release for a year, prompting “Free Snowpiercer” protests from impatient fans. Finally, the uncut film was granted a release, albeit a limited one on the Weinsteins’ lower-profile Radius-TWC label. It took just $4.5m: the film may not have been conventional popcorn fare, but it clearly had set its sights higher than that. (Meanwhile, it never even made it to UK cinemas.)Undaunted, Bong flirted with Hollywood again in Okja, a daffy fantasy romp that meshed a South Korean setting and sensibility with an international eco-warrior conscience and lashings of multiplex-friendly spectacle. Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton were on hand too, acting with the level of subtlety you’d expect of a Jon Ronson-scripted film about a mall-trashing, genetically modified superpig escaping the slaughterhouse with the loving help of an adorable tyke: Babe on highly aggressive steroids, if you will. Bong had more sympathetic Tinseltown partners than Weinstein this time: Netflix and Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment boarded the project early, stumping up a $50m production budget (breaking Snowpiercer’s aforementioned record).It premiered at Cannes, in the last year that the tradition-bound French festival permitted Netflix’s film in its competition, and was well enough received: scattered boos were directed at the streaming service rather than the film itself. But by the time it popped up on the Netflix platform a month later, it felt a bit of a non-event. Critical enthusiasm was muted relative to Bong’s earlier, wilder, more homegrown genre rides like Mother and The Host, and it quietly sank into Netflix’s unquantifiable morass of content – it’s doubtless been seen by many, but it never felt like anyone was really talking about it.Parasite, on the other hand, has been inspiring itchy international conversation since its premiere at Cannes, where it wowed critics and Alejandro González Iñárritu’s jury, who unanimously handed it the Palme d’Or. Many a Palme d’Or winner goes quiet outside the rarefied film-festival atmosphere Parasite, with its inky comedy driven by seething social fury, has found its public. With multiple global territories (including the US, UK and Japan) yet to weigh in, it has already grossed $91m worldwide eager chatter about it is lighting up social media. (If you don’t believe me, search the #BongHive hashtag on Twitter to see the film’s Generation Z cult in action.) Its hip US distributor Neon will be planning a lively Oscar campaign, targeting not just the foreign-language category, but a best picture nomination too. That would surely seal its status as the biggest Korean crossover phenomenon in film history: the BTS of cinema, effectively.That’s a pretty remarkable trajectory for a film that, in addition to its chilly, bleak outlook and grisly violence, is entirely uncompromised in its sheer Korean-ness: no English dialogue or Hollywood stars here, while the film is so vivid in its cultural specifics that jjapaguri – a kind of local instant noodle dish – serves as a key plot point. Yet Parasite’s delicious indigenous details hardly obscure its more universal agenda: it’s a film that taps into a kind of anti-capitalist rage against rigid structures of class and privilege that are being felt everywhere from Korea to America to Brexit Britain. Bong’s rollercoaster storytelling skills are a factor too, of course, but it turns out the way to engage a global audience, in this case, was not to play Hollywood’s own game: it’s the political resonance of Parasite, not any stylistic familiarity, that is striking a chord across continents.Bong isn’t the only world-cinema auteur of late, meanwhile, to find that you can go home again. His compatriot Park Chan-wook befuddled audiences with his bewitchingly bonkers American debut Stoker an indifferent commercial reception sent him back to home turf, where he made The Handmaiden and landed a global arthouse sensation. (He’s since surprised us again, heading over to the BBC to direct the very chic Le Carré miniseries The Little Drummer Girl so far, this back-and-forth travelling has cramped his style.)Haifaa Al-Mansour, the first Saudi woman to direct a feature with the arthouse charmer Wadjda, bombed when she headed abroad to make the literary biopic Mary Shelley she headed back to Saudi Arabia to direct the crowd-pleasing feminist parable The Perfect Candidate, which was warmly received at Venice and Toronto last month, and has been entered by her home country as its Oscar submission.These are different journeys, of course, from that of Alfonso Cuarón, who capitalised on his vast Hollywood success to head home for his most personal project to date – though the lavish acclaim and awards heaped upon his Netflix-backed Mexican memory piece Roma nonetheless made it a career milestone. Its good fortune, like Parasite’s, proves that Hollywood is no longer necessarily the final destination for a successful directorial career: sometimes it’s just the Emerald City, en route to a happy homecoming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2d9350e0836f1ba6b3b9caf2406cb9d44b9334c/0_51_3372_2024/master/3372.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1a5e1b0da1098aa56d077762ef23f2c6","title":"england ready walk off if racism sofia tammy abraham bulgaria","story":"• Players discuss flouting Uefa’s three-step rule in team meeting• ‘If we decide we don’t want to play, we’ll come off as a team’Tammy Abraham says England’s players have resolved to walk off the pitch in their Euro 2020 qualifier against Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday if they are subjected to racist abuse. The Chelsea striker, who has been called up for his first competitive senior matches for the national side, also revealed that the squad had discussed defying Uefa protocols.The governing body has a three-step procedure that it insists must be followed in the event of racist chants from the stands. The first two steps are an appeal over the PA system for the abuse to stop, after the referee has been notified, and a temporary suspension to the game. If neither works, the official should abandon the match.In Abraham’s opinion, there ought to be only one step. If there is any racist chanting, he feels the players should leave the field straight away – and he said that the England captain, Harry Kane, had led a conversation on that issue at a team meeting on Monday.England face Czech Republic in Prague on Friday before they travel to Sofia, where the racism fears have been sparked by the behaviour of the Bulgaria support in the qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo in June. As punishment, Bulgaria’s Stadion Vasil Levski has been partially closed for the next two internationals, one of which is the England game.“It’s a team thing. Don’t isolate one person. Harry did ask the question about instead of going through the three steps – if we decide that we want to stop the game, no matter what the score is – if we’re not happy as a team we’ll decide whether or not to stay on the pitch.“We’d just let the FA or whoever deal with whatever’s next – the scores or what happens with the points. At the time, it’s about making sure we’re a team, we don’t stand for it and we want the world to see that we don’t stand for the silly abuse.”Abraham was asked directly whether it should be one strike and out rather than three. “For me, it’s just one strike because it gives people excuses,” he said.“Like we were all saying yesterday, if it happens and let’s say there’s a warning or whatever in the stadium, then it happens again, we have to make a decision as a team and with the staff.”It has been a tumultuous season for Abraham. Back at Chelsea after consecutive season-long loans at Bristol City, Swansea and Aston Villa, he missed the decisive penalty in the club’s second game – the European Super Cup defeat to Liverpool – and was racially abused on social media afterwards.“I dealt with that in the best way possible,” Abraham said. “I stayed away from Twitter and all social media and I just spent time with my teammates and my family.Abraham, who has since scored nine goals for Chelsea to earn his England selection, has also been in the headlines because of Nigeria’s desire to have him declare for them. The 22-year-old qualifies for the African nation through his father and because his two caps for England came in the friendlies against Germany and Brazil in November 2017 he has had to option to switch his allegiance. Abraham will be committed to England if he features against Czech Republic or Bulgaria and he said that he always wanted to play for them.The Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson has been called up to the squad to replace the injured Tom Heaton."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02623d67ba2c3e5cb520a4fd22919445b258bab6/0_519_4503_2703/master/4503.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801b6f1c84d1c548e7c78dd989aa28bc","title":"iranian women allowed to watch football at stadium for first time in decades","story":"Iranian women will be able to enter a football stadium on Thursday for the first time in decades, after Fifa threatened to suspend the Islamic republic over its controversial male-only policy.

The directive came after a fan dubbed “Blue Girl” died after setting herself on fire in fear of being jailed for dressing up as a boy in order to attend a match.Women were quick to get their hands on tickets to attend Iran’s 2022 World Cup qualifier against Cambodia at Tehran’s Azadi Stadium on Thursday.

A sports ministry official said the 100,000-capacity stadium – whose name means “Freedom” in Farsi – was ready to host even more women.One of the 3,500 women to have secured a ticket was Raha Poorbakhsh, a football journalist. “I still can’t believe this is going to happen because after all these years of working in this field, watching everything on television, now I can experience everything in person,” she told AFP.But Poorbakhsh said she was aware of many other women without tickets and some were expected to travel from as far away as Ahvaz in southern Iran in the hope of still getting one. Those lucky enough to attend will be segregated from men and watched over by 150 female police officers, according to Fars news agency.People on the streets of Tehran said they supported the decision to allow women into stadiums. “I would like there to be freedom for women, like men, to go freely and even sit side by side without any restrictions, like other countries,” said a woman who only gave her name as Hasti.Nader Fathi, who runs a clothing business, said the presence of women could improve the atmosphere in stadiums. But he said “they will regret it” if they are exposed to “really bad swear words” and “bad behaviour”.Ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, Iran has come under pressure from Fifa to allow women to attend this round of qualifiers. The ban on women in stadiums is not written into law or regulations, but it has been strictly enforced.Since the 1979 Islamic revolution, women have only had rare access to stadiums in Iran. About 20 Irish women attended a World Cup qualifier in 2001, and four years later a few dozen Iranian women were allowed to watch the national “Team Melli” take on Bahrain.In October, as many as 100 Iranian “handpicked” women entered Azadi for a friendly against Bolivia. But the day after, the prosecutor general warned there would be no repeat, saying it would “lead to sin”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba2d458b3ce48c0ae61558fb52053c00cc96d5c/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65616a1399dd51f63918599d0c9d54ae","title":"next generation 2019 20 of the best talents at premier league clubs","story":" selects the best young players at each club born between 1 September 2002 and 31 August 2003, an age band known as first-year scholars.

But things are finally starting to improve for themTasnia Akter has come home. It’s a public holiday in Bangladesh, the one time of year the 25-year-old can leave the mayhem of the city behind and see her family: her mother, her aunt.And her daughter.“There she is!” Her little girl is standing in front of the two-bedroom tin hut in a remote village 200km (125 miles) north of Chittagong, south-east Bangladesh. Mother and daughter embrace.If she could, the young seamstress would still live here. The air is fresher, there is more space, and some of her friends still live in the village. There’s just one problem: “There isn’t any work.” Agriculture has ceased to be a feasible source of income. Money doesn’t grow on trees – it is spun in the textile looms of the city.And so this family copes as best it can, the older women raising the child while Tasnia works six-day weeks, sewing T-shirts and jeans for global consumers, for about 8,400 taka (£80) a month.These three generations are a neat microcosm of an entire nation. The older women, who grew up in the years after independence in 1971, worked in unpaid labour, trying to survive in the grinding poverty for which the country became renowned in the 1970s.The young girl, a 21st-century child, schooled and spirited, will in all probability enjoy better prospects. And in the middle, Tasnia Akter, from the “factory generation”, one of approximately 4.5 million textile workers who have transformed the fortunes and reputation of Bangladesh.The crucial question is this: is Akter a glorious paragon of the “rise and rise” of Bangladesh, with its 50-year journey to becoming a middle-income nation powered by hard-working women? Or is she a sickening example of an exploited labourer who ruins her health for companies making high margins and consumers who buy cheap jeans?The answer: perhaps a bit of both.“Sure, Tasnia suffers a lot, she has to support her family – but I had to suffer much more,” says her aunt, Honufa Begum. After her husband died, Begum worked as a maid in Chittagong. “Just provide food and lodging for me and my daughter,” she recalls asking the family. They did. But they did not pay her. Begum did not complain.Ever wondered why you feel so gloomy about the world - even at a time when humanity has never been this healthy and prosperous? Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“I am uneducated,” Akter explains, sitting on a bed in her aunt’s house under a fan. “In the city I could work as a maid. But I don’t want to be a slave. I don’t want to always be on my toes, waiting for orders. At least when I come home in the evening from the factory, I am done for the day.”When the history is written of how much of humanity was lifted out of poverty in the decades after 1980, Bangladesh will provide one of the biggest chapters. GDP has soared vertiginously since 1980.People now live on average one-third longer than they used to 40 years ago – a gain in longevity that is practically without rival anywhere in the world.But it has not come without tragedy, toil and exploitation. Six years ago, the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Dhaka, killing more than 1,100 people, injuring more than 2,300. Rana Plaza became synonymous with textile workers’ atrocious working conditions for the blood, sweat and sacrifice so easily overlooked by western consumers hunting bargain T-shirts on the high street. Bangladeshi workers are still among the lowest-paid in the world.Over the years, however, activists, workers and researchers have fought for at least some change in the garment industry. The minimum wage has doubled. Safety improvements have been made. Many workers are able to put a little aside to ensure that their children get a proper education.The vast industry generates myriad sub-industries too. The market along the dusty main road in Chittagong is usually bustling with people. Opposite the Clifton garments factory, Jallal Uddin, 38, is selling cake, bananas and tea to the workers on their way home. The father of two has had his stall for eight years now. He is proud of not having accumulated any debt. His formula is simple: the more garment workers there are, the more business for him.Tasnia Akter has been working for her factory for the past four years. The small premises is owned by one of the country’s big manufacturers: there are more than 30,000 employees, with brand customers such as WalMart and H\u0026ampM. For Akter, working in the factory means progress: it is a means of paying the debts of her family, to support her seven-year-old daughter, and to earn a living after her husband left her – a fate that many garment workers share.“I don’t really have a choice,” she says. She sends around 2,000 taka home every month, as well as the occasional windfall: a rice cooker is stored in her parents’ cupboard the company awarded it to her for not missing any days and for working quickly.But if she can’t save anything for herself, is she really getting on? Is progressing from slave-like working conditions to meagre salaries really enough? Or is the country’s sweatshop image still accurate today?Khondaker Golam Moazzem, research director at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a thinktank in Dhaka, shakes his head. “Not at all.” The economist believes that – at least in a broader sense – the textile industry has lifted millions out of poverty. In the 1980s, workers lived in shacks and toiled in factories with no toilets or safe drinking water. Now even a cursory look at their lunch boxes will show they are eating better than in the past, he says.But he adds that many workers are malnourished and some still sleep on the floor. “Most workers can’t save anything for their post-work years.” Nevertheless, there are small indications that the quality of life is improving. “Workers like to spend the last penny for the betterment of the family: some send their children to private kindergarten, or to private tutors.”It was the Rana Plaza  disaster that arguably triggered the biggest safety improvements. Following a broad deal between unions and more than 200 garment companies such as Primark and H\u0026ampM, more than 1,600 factories were inspected and hazards identified and dealt with. Factory owners invested in fire doors, sprinkler systems and electrical upgrades. Some tore down factories and built them anew to keep their business going. A general manager of the company where Tasnia Akter works says the new rules of business are simple: “No compliance, no contracts.”“If you compare pre-Rana Plaza and post-Rana Plaza, the one thing that really has changed is safety,” says Kalpona Akter (no relation to Tasnia), a labour activist and executive director of the Bangladesh Centre for Worker Solidarity (BCWS). Between 2005 and 2012, more than 500 workers died in textile factories. After 2014, the annual number of fatalities has remained “well under 30”, according to the Stern Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University .“Workers are now more aware of their rights,” says Kalpona Akter. When she founded BCWS in 2000, few workers knew they had any rights at all. “Now workers perhaps won’t die in the factory – but they will nevertheless slowly die of malnourishment,” Hasan Maruf Rumi says. The activist and politician explains how it is impossible to feed a family on the new minimum wage of 8,000 taka.When asked how much she thinks she deserves, Tasnia Akter says: 10,000 taka, around £96.In Chittagong, many workers live near the factories. The streets, turned muddy by the rain, are lined with corner shops, barbers and vegetable sellers. Nadira Begum, a 26-year-old sewing operator, shares a room with her three-year-old daughter in a compound with other families. Her husband shows up from time to time he has another wife as well.“As soon as there is a raise, everything gets more expensive,” she says. She already pays around 3,000 taka per month for the room. While Begum earns about nine times as much as her mother, she is unsure whether her purchasing power has gone up much. She does have amenities such as a fan and a fridge. She joined the union after it helped her when she was about to be fired for being pregnant, she says. Now she has lost her job. Begum believes it is primarily because she is a union member. But she doesn’t seem too fazed. One thing that has changed is her self-assurance, the pride in her abilities: “I am not worried. I am a skilled worker I will just go and get another job.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

Instead, a ledger of transactions is maintained by a decentralised network of computers.This system of decentralisation offers non-profit organisations the advantage of bypassing expensive fees and middlemen traditionally required to move large amounts of cash overseas quickly.But the virtual currencies have also been isive. They are associated with huge price fluctuations, and have been previously used as a mechanism to support illicit activities such as money laundering and online drug dealing.Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at Unicef Innovation, said the initiative would prepare the organisation for the future while also maintaining safeguards built into existing donor systems. “We see this as a piece of learning that we need to go through to prepare for the next decade,” he said.For aid organisations, cryptocurrencies make tracking donations easier, and have the potential to allow donors to see how their money is used.“There’s an interest in speed and efficiency,” said Fabian. “We have a good capacity to move money globally, but there’s always friction.”Recent years have seen a mushrooming of cryptocurrencies – even Facebook launched its own coin – the libra – in 2019. Interest from philanthropic organisations in virtual currencies has seen the creation of AidCoin and Pinkcoin, tailored for the aid sector.Unicef joins a number of aid agencies that have started accepting donations in virtual coins, including the American Red Cross and the UN World Food Programme.Rhodri Davies, head of policy at the Charities Aid Foundation, said that the initial excitement about currencies using blockchain technology in the aid sector had delivered smaller windfalls than had been hoped. “It’s been a lot slower than people might have expected two or three years ago,” he said.He said successes of the cryptocurrency donation model were largely limited to internet-based charities – to organisations such as Wikimedia or the Electronic Frontier Foundation.In 2019, Fidelity Charitable, a charity that distributes money through donor-advised funds in the US, reported receiving donations of $106m (£87m) in virtual money since 2015 – though volatility in the currencies may have affected the value of the donations.The new Unicef fund will hold donations and disburse them in the same cryptocurrency – initiatives funded through it will sign contracts denominated in the same type of virtual coinage.Fabian said to reduce risks caused by the currencies’ volatility, most of the initial projects funded in this way would be short-term.He said the organisation would also uphold existing donor protocols – so those making donations online would have to pass rigorous checks before they were allowed to deposit funds to Unicef."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818ee76c533e541ca8392075e12d69eacc76431b/0_989_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76564dff25e47c31ae127286903a357","title":"what are your views on modern masculinity","story":"For our second series about modern masculinity, we’d like to hear men’s views on fatherhood and getting older Earlier in the year we did a call out to  readers asking for your views on the issues affecting men which helped guide a series looking at modern masculinity in 2019.Your responses led us to address questions around role models, intergenerational relationships and even the popularity of Jordan Peterson, and we want to return with a second series, led by you, looking deeper into the areas that you want to see us addressing.We know about some of the issues that men are interested in discussing such as pornography, fatherhood and getting older, so we want to hear your views on those topics but we’d also like you to tell us what we should cover in the next series too.You can share your views in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you prefer.

She launched into a graphic description of her baby’s recent birth. “… and then Aunty Helen* barged right into the room holding up her phone, taking photos of my hoo-hars”.I had never seen this woman before, wasn’t aware the word hoo-har could be a plural, and couldn’t have picked Aunty Helen out of a lineup for a cash prize. But somehow she knew I had written the pregnancy book she’d read. In her mind, I’d been through the pregnancy with her, so she was just giving me the exit report. It was lovely.It makes me emotional, knowing that hundreds of thousands of pregnant women over the last 20 years have had my “voice” in their head for the journey. Readers tend to read it week by week as they progress in pregnancy, and they say, “How did you know I’d have a stuffed nose that week?” or “ I started to cry watching the news the exact same time you mentioned it”. Partly it’s because I took notes during my own pregnancy, about physical hassles, but also about feelings – something largely ignored by pregnancy books at the time. They assumed you lived in England or America, were married, white and terrified about carrot cake making your foetus too fat.A lot has changed since the first edition of Up the Duff in 1999. Talkback callers are no longer scandalised by the title. Male book-page editors ignore it, rather than dismissing it in a paragraph, as one did then. My stretch marks have faded to silvery badges of honour.Now 20 years of medical changes have been researched and added, and mental health issues such as depression and anxiety are covered, thanks to the help of Australian consultants, many of them world experts in their medical field.While scientific research has identified more risk factors and developed new tests for rare problems, I wanted to keep the tone of the new edition comforting and fun. There’s new information, but people haven’t changed in 20 years. Everyone needs and deserves reassurance about a pregnancy. We have the same need for information, the same worries about childbirth and being a parent, the same confusion about what’s safe to eat while pregnant.The newer routine tests that every pregnant woman is offered, and the ones that screen for genetic conditions, which can cost hundreds of dollars, can be complex and confusing. Not just whether to have them, but what the results mean. Different experts have gone over and over various sections to help me get the tone and facts right. It’s a wonder some of them haven’t blocked my number.When I started researching the first edition most women didn’t know enough about their own pregnancies. Now, there’s “too much”: an ocean of advice, much of it misinformation. A “reputable” news outlet a while ago suggested using a gardening wheelbarrow as a pram (unsafe!), and a parenting website recommended squirting soapy water up your vagina soon after the birth to “keep things fresh down there”. Well, only if you fancy a fresh infection.Social media wasn’t even a “thing” 20 years ago. You didn’t look at your phone and see pictures of women in crop tops brandishing a mango at you and giving pregnancy “nutrition” advice despite having no qualifications. Or feel you had to put on a show. Now we’re bombarded with heaps of hard-sell ads and pressure to buy expensive apps (mostly totally useless).Back then hardly anyone knew if they were having a boy or a girl – now nearly everyone can, and many wonder whether a gender reveal party is a good idea. (The new Up the Duff has a list of pros and cons cons include starting a bushfire with baby-blue fireworks.)There are a lot of jokes and cartoons in the book, but the new sections on miscarriage, stillbirth and terminations for medical reasons required a delicate approach. You don’t get to choose whether these things happen to you, and they’re never “your fault”. Everyone deserves the best information to help with their decisions, even if their parenthood has been invisible to others. And while old editions say babies move less towards the end of a pregnancy – approved advice at the time – the new one explains that we can reduce the rate of stillbirths if everyone monitors their baby’s movements after 35 weeks and knows that less movements than usual means they need to see a doctor.We now know the risk is less when a pregnant woman tries not to sleep on her back in the last weeks, too. Reliable new research shows women with south Asian or African heritage may expect a “full-term” pregnancy of 38 weeks, not 40. Advice on reducing the risk of sudden infant death has changed and been refined over the years.So I’m trying to get the word out that people should use all second-hand copies of Up the Duff for souvenir, compost or kindling purposes only.What will Up the Duff cover in another 20 years? Babies in space? Robot rockers? I know this for sure: I’ll still be updating it every year, and I’ll definitely hold your baby for you, in a cafe, while you go to the loo. But no, I won’t want to see Aunty Helen’s photo of your hoo-hars.Kaz Cooke is author of Up the Duff and its sequel Babies \u0026amp Toddlers, which replaced the old Kid Wrangling (which is now also good for compost) Girl Stuff 8-12, and Girl Stuff 13+."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6cfdf89250c03135ad7d44c01e2384cc72c81a2/46_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d979c9cf56943df5951bb4e9de51919f","title":"right here right now fatboy slim samples greta thunberg for live show","story":"The dance artist electrifies crowd after mixing the climate activist’s UN speech slogan with his club favourite Fatboy Slim has paid tribute to Greta Thunberg in a performance in Gateshead over the weekend, mixing her speech to the United Nations into a performance of his club favourite Right Here, Right Now.The mash-up opens with Thunberg’s voice, delivering her blistering speech to world leaders about the climate crisis over the synth melody.“People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money,” the 16-year-old is heard saying. “You are failing us, and the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you.“We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”The sample of Thunberg saying “right here, right now” is used throughout the song.The mash-up originally appeared on social media in late September, after musician David Scott from The Kiffness made and shared it to images of ice bergs breaking up.Fatboy Slim, whose real name is Norman Cook, shared video of the mash-up on Facebook. But he has now integrated Thunberg’s speech into his live show, performing it at his Gateshead show on Friday night.Scott Jackson, 40, from Middlesbrough, filmed the mash-up at the Gateshead show.Jackson, who said he found Thunberg’s speech “incredibly powerful and emotive” said he had seen a short clip of the remix during the week and loved it, so wanted to film how it sounded in a large arena.“The mash-up is superb,” he said. “The way she says ‘right here, right now’ fits his original perfectly.”“The crowd could sense something special was in the air as it started, sensing something big was about to go down and it certainly did!”Thunberg’s speech was the most striking and talked-about event at the recent meeting of world leaders at the United Nations in New York.Donald Trump tweeted a video of an emotional Thunberg delivering the speech, with an apparently sarcastic comment, writing: “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!”But world leaders and artists rallied in support of the teenage activist, including Billie Eilish, Janelle Monáe, Ellie Goulding, Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio, who all tweeted clips of Thunberg’s speech or in praise of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c3ca72c3b12c84daa800f915ff801eadf199205/0_559_6519_3912/master/6519.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=262d205bc55da9d1718d89b4dfb92d6a","title":"ive been here 50 years the eu citizens struggling for the right to stay in britain","story":"If they don’t secure the correct status, most EU nationals living in the UK post-Brexit will be classified as illegal immigrants. And after the Windrush scandal, we know what that looks like. By  Amelia GentlemanIn early May, Doris Ratnam sat at her kitchen table, trying to scan her German passport with her mobile phone. She was applying for “settled status” in the UK, the new immigration status the 3.4 million or so EU nationals living in Britain need to acquire if they want to stay in the country legally after Brexit. Ratnam, who is 72 and has lived in London since arriving as an au pair in 1968, was annoyed that she should be required to apply to remain in a country she considers her home.She was flustered by the process of attempting to get her phone to suck all her personal details out of her passport. Something was not working, and we sat for 20 minutes in near silence as she moved the phone slowly over the cover of the passport, as shown in a reassuring Home Office Youtube video, trying to get it to read the chip hidden inside the document. “Move the phone to read the chip,” Ratnam muttered, studying the guidance notes. “What am I supposed to do? Move the phone to find the chip. I feel stressed … it’s the technology.”After repeated failed attempts, the app informed her she had been locked out of the system for 24 hours. It would take two-and-a-half months, two visits to the local town hall (an hour on two buses each way), a £15 appointment fee and numerous calls to a Home Office helpline before her status was approved. The process was dispiriting. “I shouldn’t be made to feel like a foreigner again after such a long time here,” she said.Before the end of June 2021, if Britain leaves the EU with a deal, or by 31 December 2020 with no deal, most EU nationals resident in the UK must have applied for settled status if they want to continue living and working here. The EU settled status scheme is designed to fulfil the government’s promise that all EU citizens, their family members, and dependants living here before Brexit, will be entitled to remain, with no diminishment of their rights. Anyone who has lived here continuously for five years should, in theory, be able to get settled status easily people who have been here for less than five years will be granted “pre-settled” status, requiring them to reapply for permanent status once they have racked up enough years of continuous residence (which means not leaving the country for more than six months a year).For Europeans in the UK, the Home Office’s “EU Exit: ID Document Check” app is the gateway between belonging and exclusion. How well this piece of software works will be a crucial factor in the government’s attempts to present Brexit as a success. In the past year, almost 1.5 million Europeans living in the UK have grappled with the Home Office application process and managed to secure settled or pre-settled status. The Home Office would like us to celebrate this as a bureaucratic success story, and in a very optimistic frame of mind, perhaps we might.The government has allocated about £460m to the scheme, of which about £50m was spent on developing this unflashy app, its opening pages headed with the outline of a crown on a royal blue background. At the launch of the scheme in March, a Home Office radio advertising campaign reassured people: “It is free, and all you need is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form.”In May, I was taken on a tour of the Home Office’s Liverpool offices, where 1,500 workers were then handling about 6,000 “settled status” applications a day (it has since risen to 20,000). At the end of the tour, one of the senior civil servants in charge of the scheme said it would be good to see media coverage emphasising how well things are working. “In an ideal world, we want you to write an article saying you have come here, and there’s nothing to be afraid of.”After the deadline, those who have failed to apply will gradually be transformed from legal residents into undocumented migrants. In the hostile environment – the obstructive and unwelcoming bureaucratic culture promoted by Theresa May when she was home secretary – they will be unable to work, rent somewhere to live, access free healthcare, drive, open a bank account, get a mobile phone contract or travel without being asked to prove their status. They will gradually discover that normal life has become impossible.The Home Office has never attempted a digital exercise on this scale. All the unknowns – numbers, timing, terms of the deal – have presented developers with unexpected challenges. By the end of January, two months before it was due to launch nationally, IT specialists working for the Home Office had successfully designed a scheme that charged applicants £65. Days before the app was rolled out for public testing, they were told that the fees were too politically sensitive and needed to be scrapped – leaving them no time to rebuild the app without the fee pages. So, as an awkward last-minute fix, initial applicants were charged anyway and had to get their money refunded later. The decision to scrap the fee also meant the government instantly lost about £190m of revenue that the scheme was meant to bring in.“They were trying to deliver the biggest, most contentious new system that any of them had likely ever worked on, while the basic requirements were changing around them, even days before they went live,” said Joe Owen, the programme director of the Institute for Government, a thinktank working to make government more effective. Owen has been tracing the development of the scheme since the EU referendum.One major problem was that the scheme does not yet work on the iPhone. The Home Office has been struggling with Apple’s refusal to allow third-party developers to use its contactless system since the start of the app’s development. Given that iPhones account for almost half the smartphones in the UK, this creates a major headache for applicants. Many people have had to borrow phones, or take the longer route of sending off their passports for manual scanning. Officials say the app should begin to be available on iPhones later this month.Another complication is that it is not known how many EU nationals there are in the UK. The figure of 3.4 million that the government is basing all its plans on is thought by many to be an underestimate.“Nobody knows exactly how many are eligible,” said Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. The government’s estimate was “almost certain to be too low because it doesn’t include people living in non-private addresses like hostels or care homes, and the figures are thought to undercount several groups – new arrivals, EUnon-EU dual citizens, and people who spend part of the year outside the UK.”Nor does the estimate include close family members from non-EU countries, who are also eligible under this scheme. The total number of people who need to apply could perhaps be as high as 4 million.For the moment the political rhetoric remains warm, and officials say people who have a good reason for missing the deadline will be allowed a “reasonable” further period to apply, but the small print spells out the chilling consequences of failing to get status. Although politicians are not currently choosing to highlight this publicly, the Home Office has made it clear in planning documents that, from January 2021 (in a no-deal scenario), anyone without valid UK immigration status “will be liable to enforcement action, detention and removal as an immigration offender”.It is not surprising that so many of the 3 million-plus are feeling vulnerable and furious. They were demonised by the leave campaign as the problem to which Brexit was the solution they have faced years of hostile newspaper headlines they are angry that the scheme has been developed as an application process rather than a registration scheme (meaning that the status is only acquired by successfully applying for it under a registration scheme, EU citizens who had failed to apply successfully for the status would not immediately become illegal). They point out that this is not the automatic guarantee of rights the Vote Leave campaign and the government promised. Being forced to apply for the right to stay in their homes has been the final insult. For all its royal blue neutrality, many see the app as performing a distasteful political function – locating them, counting them and classifying them.Meanwhile, all over Europe, about 1.4 million expatriate Britons are anxiously monitoring the scheme, aware that their own treatment could depend largely on how generously the UK government treats EU citizens.In April 2018, it emerged that thousands of people who had been born in Commonwealth countries and moved to the UK as children in the 1960s and 70s, when there was free movement between Britain and its former colonies, had become the victims of changes to immigration legislation. In what became known as the Windrush scandal, those who had never applied for British passports found themselves wrongly classified as immigration offenders. Some were detained and removed from the UK, back to countries they had not visited in half a century. Others lost their jobs or homes or were denied NHS treatment.Their experiences have alarmed EU nationals. The scandal highlighted how poor the Home Office’s capacity is for accurately identifying who is living in the UK legally or illegally, and its reputation has crystallised as an institution that combines malice with incompetence. Many of those obliged to apply for the scheme find the prospect of giving all their personal details to the Home Office disturbing.For about a quarter of applicants, the process is more complicated than simply submitting passport details and completing an online form. The Advertising Standards Authority has recently ruled that the reassuring Home Office radio advertisement must not be broadcast again, after a complainant pointed out that in some cases applicants had to provide much more documentation than just a passport or ID card.Since the beginning of the year, Labour has been warning of looming problems with the system, even talking of “Windrush on steroids”. But such warnings are often firmly slapped down as just being part of “project fear”. (“I find your comparisons to Windrush inappropriate,” Priti Patel, the home secretary, told the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, this month.)Even the Conservative and arch Brexiter MEP Daniel Hannan has voiced concern on Twitter, warning that he has had cases of EU nationals in his south-east England constituency being denied settled status despite living in the UK for years. “This is a breach of the assurances I and others gave during the referendum.” He called on Patel “to sort this out … before we end up with another Windrush scandal”.Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million, an organisation set up to support EU nationals, describes the decision to introduce an application system with a cut-off date as a timebomb, because so many will fail to apply on time. Switching metaphors, he warns this will be an “illegal immigrants factory … designed to create thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants”.At the Home Office building in Liverpool, where many of the 1,500 people employed to process the applications are based, there is a relentlessly positive atmosphere. Everyone here is aware of the damage done to the Home Office’s reputation by Windrush. In recent years, the Home Office has been condemned by politicians for being steeped in a “culture of disbelief”, where staff are expected to probe for tiny inconsistencies in the accounts of refugees, and where officials are instructed to “deport first, hear appeals later”.Many Windrush victims described how they had tried repeatedly to explain that they were not illegal immigrants, but had been ignored, or simply unable to find a Home Office caseworker ready to listen. Before she resigned, Amber Rudd apologised for the “appalling” actions of her own department, blaming a culture in the Home Office which had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”. In turn, her successor Sajid Javid promised to introduce a “fairer, more compassionate” immigration system. This hasn’t materialised in most of the department, according to immigration lawyers and caseworkers, but in these open-plan offices in Liverpool, up an escalator, above a Tesco and a florist, something does appear to have changed.If things are working, the full application should take about 15 minutes (there are a few more questions on residency and criminality once ID checks are completed). Under the new scheme, the Home Office doesn’t care if applicants are self-sufficient, studying or working – simply whether they are resident in the UK or not this is verified by making instant checks with HMRC. Applicants have to do three things: prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. Once data has been scanned from people’s passports via their phone, they have to take a selfie, so the app can identify if the correct person is applying. The app checks identity through facial matching in the same way travellers are checked in airports at e-passport gates.To reduce the possibility of fraud, there is no physical document at the end of the process, just a digital record, which can be shared with a landlord or an employer (after Brexit, they will have to check EU nationals’ eligibility) via a time-limited unique code, on a smartphone.On one floor in Liverpool, staff sit at computers flicking through screens. A passport photograph flashes up, and the employee checks to make sure it matches the selfie taken and submitted through the app. Although much of the system is automated, every case is checked by a human before a decision is made. These human checks can take just 10 minutes. Some people are getting an email back telling them they have settled status within a couple of hours.When I visited, there was a homely smell of microwaved stew helium balloons hovered over the desk of someone who had been given a baby shower. Special EU Settlement Resolution Centre teacups have been printed for staff, with inspirational slogans on them. Most of the staff are newly hired, many of them students. One of the few longer-serving members of staff, who has worked at the Home Office for five years, said it was a relief not to have to be so sceptical when dealing with people’s applications. “Before the onus was more on ‘prove it’. Now we are doing everything we can to help,” she said. “When I first joined, it was noticeable that not many cases would result in us issuing the applicant with what they needed.”The only people likely to be refused will be those with “persistent and serious” criminal records and, so far, only one person has been refused – although a number of people have been dismayed to get the lesser, more precarious pre-settled status, despite having been in the UK for more than five years. Campaigners suspect that the difficult cases may be going to the bottom of the pile, to keep the figures looking favourable.When the project began, one of the senior civil servants in charge ordered a number of copies of a book called In Limbo, compiled by an Italian translator Elena Remigi, so he and colleagues could read the 144 testimonies of EU nationals resident in Britain, people who were worried about their post-Brexit future here, people who are, the blurb says, “haunted by the poignant question: where is home?” They say the book helped them understand the worries faced by those being asked to apply. Videos have been made for people who struggle with literacy, there is helpline assistance for those who are not confident with technology. The guidance has been translated into all 26 languages (although the helpline advice is only available in English and Welsh). In addition, £9m has been allocated to funding charities (organisations such as Citizens Advice and the East European Resource Centre) to help an estimated 200,000 vulnerable or hard to reach people to apply. Downstairs there is a hotline this is the first time in 10 years that people have been able to call a Home Office number and speak to a caseworker, rather than an employee at an outsourced firm, reading from a script.In August, Patel announced an end to freedom of movement in a no-deal scenario at the end of next month. Officials quickly had to clarify on her behalf that free movement would not be ending on that date (since EU law continues to apply until its legal foundation is repealed). Unfortunately, the home secretary’s premature announcement led to a spike in calls leading to long waiting times.“We’re trying to change the perception of the Home Office,” the woman who heads the call centre said. Staff have dealt with a lot of people who were “upset, frightened and angry”, she said. “We understand why. This is something that has happened to those people. They weren’t consulted or even given a vote in it. They are now having to apply for something that they always had.”Windrush victims waited years for anyone to pay attention to their difficulties with the Home Office, as they lost jobs and homes and faced detention. By comparison, a mildly famous French baker or Polish chef struggling with the EU status app need only send an irritated Tweet for newspapers to print outraged articles. The reality TV celebrity Fred Sirieix, after tweeting his frustration, had calls from the Home Office within 24 hours to resolve things. Home Office staff seem at pains to act fast to resolve high-profile cases, to quell the noise but less clear is what happens to those who have less of a public profile.For some people, the experience is genuinely easy. Some people describe doing it while sitting on the sofa at home, and being pleasantly surprised at getting an email confirming that they have been granted settled status within hours. The difficulty is that while around three-quarters are getting through easily and a quarter need to submit further information, a small proportion will have more complicated experiences.We already know that too many people are wrongly being allocated pre-settled status instead of the more permanent settled status, a problem that came up during the testing phase, Home Office staff told me. “One of the things we were surprised about in early testing was that people thought they were clicking the button for full settled status, but they were actually accepting pre-settled status, and then being surprised. So we tried to make quite a lot of changes to the guidance to reinforce that,” an official said.But the problem persists, and campaigners say there are still oddities in the design of the application form, which does not ask people how long they have lived in the UK or which status they hope to get. Only the most well-informed applicants will know they can challenge an incorrect allocation of pre-settled status.The immigration lawyer Chris Desira has spoken to audiences of EU nationals at more than 200 information sessions arranged by embassies and community groups all over the UK in the past three years. He has identified many vulnerable groups who might find it hard to supply the evidence required to prove that they qualify for settled status – elderly people, people with disabilities, children in care, stay-at-home women who haven’t worked or paid bills, and victims of domestic abuse whose partners have all their papers. He is conscious that the awareness of the need to apply has not got through to everyone. “I am massively worried, massively,” said Desira. He has seen older people who have been here for decades crying in meetings, worried they are going to be put on a plane out of the country. “Even when you tell them, ‘I am confident that if you fill in this form, you will be fine, you will get settled status’, the anxiety and the stress and everything that is happening around them prevents them from hearing that message.”His concerns are echoed by Chai Patel of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants, who warns that the scheme is set up to be easy for people who are “wealthy, well-educated people”. He is concerned at the absence of a physical document proving status. “The scheme is very easy if you know your rights, you’re online and you’re bolshie enough to be able to stand up for what you’re entitled to. It won’t work so well for the more vulnerable. We are expecting hundreds of thousands of people to be left without status if the scheme continues as it is,” he said.I met Chris Desira at an event organised in a central London YMCA hall by the German embassy earlier this year, where he and two German diplomats, attempted to answer the questions of people confused by what they needed to do in order to ensure they could continue to live in the UK. While the official line appeared to be “Don’t panic”, the cumulative effect of almost two hours of anxious questions left many feeling disturbed.One by one, German citizens stood up to voice their alarm. “It’s giving me stomach ache. I’ve been here since 1961,” one woman said, before being reassured that she simply needed to make the application, and she would be fine. (Stephanie Dawoud of the immigration charity Imix, who was translating into my ear, said most of the meetings she had attended had a similar feeling of distress, particularly among older people, who were particularly worried by the unfamiliar notion of apps and applying digitally.) A woman in her 30s was worried about whether she should transfer her business out of the country.The German diplomat presiding over the occasion (who asked not to be named) exhibited a mournful sense of humour at some of the questions.“What happens to German civil servants?” someone asked.“I would love to know that, too!” the diplomat replied.“Can I come into the country after Brexit?” one woman asked.“Yes, unless you scare the people are the border into thinking you are a threat to national security,” said the diplomat.“Should I stockpile food?” another wanted to know, to wry laughter from the room.“The exciting thing is that you’re jumping into a big black hole,” the diplomat replied.There were questions about eligibility to healthcare in a no-deal scenario, questions about how to apply for dual nationality and questions about how UK pensions would be uprated if they were paid in Germany. “I have no information whatsoever on how it will pan out. You don’t know what the British government will do,” the diplomat said sadly. Doris Ratnam was at the back of the room, wondering how she was going to organise herself to apply. She had left her small Black Forest village near Baden Baden in 1968, aged 20, hoping to learn English, a language that neither of her parents spoke. She married a Malaysian citizen in London he became naturalised decades ago, but she didn’t want to, because for a long time it was difficult to get British citizenship without losing your German passport. (That changed in the pre-Brexit period.)She felt disheartened at applying for a status she considered to be hers already, as well as alarmed by the digital application. She invited me to watch the process of using the app in May, at her neat north-west London home, reached through a garden of pink roses and trimmed hedges. “I’ve been paying taxes here for 50 years, it should be simple,” she said, offering me coffee and ginger snaps.But her passport could not be read by the app, even though she had travelled through a passport e-gate, which uses the same technology, only four days earlier.The process of applying had made her think about her attitudes to Britishness. “I find it difficult to know after all this time whether I feel at home here. I certainly don’t feel British, like a British person, but I have English friends … I feel in-between I feel both. There’s a saying: the British are too polite to be honest, the Germans are too honest to be polite. I think there is something in it.”On the helpline, after much time listening to jangly hold music, the Home Office helper was both polite and honest, but had no answer as to why the app was not reading the digital code. She was advised to seek out one of the 80 designated EU settlement scheme scanning offices (in council offices and town hall register offices) where the passport could be scanned manually.It took weeks for Ratnam to get an appointment at Ealing town hall, but she finally went on 4 July, consulting a photocopied map to find room 1.13, winding right, then left along echoing corridors, then right, then left again, up some marble steps, past a bust of Chopin through the beautiful, almost empty mock-gothic building, soon to be decommissioned and turned into a boutique hotel. Once we arrived at a small, pink-doored room, the official inside was unable to help, also attempting to swipe the passport on a phone until the system locked her out, too. So Ratnam then sat in the waiting room on the phone to the resolution centre in Liverpool for another 40 minutes , asking for help. “I can only advise that the application is locked for 24 hours. We can’t override that,” an official said. “For the time being there is nothing further we can do to help.”“I’m just fed up,” Ratnam said, a red flush of worry creeping up her neck. “I’m getting worked up I can’t even get my words out. I don’t want to keep trying.”She organised a second appointment at the town hall on 10 July. The passport was finally scanned, quite easily, that day, but two days later she received an email asking her to upload an image of her old passport showing a historic stamp giving her indefinite leave to remain. The same email told her that the Home Office could find no record of her indefinite leave to remain and wanted to “confirm that you are related to your EU family member as claimed”. The email was a mistake. She couldn’t work out how to upload the passport there was another long phone call to Liverpool on 15 July, after which she managed to send off the picture.“I can hear it in your voice, how anxious you are,” a call handler told her.“Why can’t you just check my HMRC records?” Ratnam asked. “I’ve been paying tax for long enough.”On 16 July, an email arrived telling her that her documents had been sent in an “unsupported format and we have been unable to attach the files to your application”. But puzzlingly, a minute later, a second email arrived, saying that her “application to the EU Settlement Scheme has been successful”.Ratnam has managed to secure her status. Nothing catastrophic went wrong with her application – just a series of irritations that sucked up her time and lowered her mood. Similar irritations will be felt by tens of thousands of others going through the process, reinforcing a sense of alienation. “I’m annoyed that I had to do it after 50 years here. There were mistakes and it was stressful. I don’t feel welcome having to go through a process like that.”Campaigners worry most about those who do not realise they need to apply, or those who have difficulties converting their pre-settled status into the permanent settled status in the years that follow Brexit. Nicolas Hatton of the 3million charity warns: “On 1 January 2021, if there is no deal, and you haven’t applied, you will be an illegal immigrant. The hostile environment is no joke. That’s when the timebomb will explode.”• This article was amended on 8 October 2019 to clarify that most but not all EU nationals resident in the UK must have applied for settled status if they want to continue living and working here.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e54d5c1b795fdf09a2e8c0dabce9e0c3c7001fa/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f29b758d78f9eac6336c3a7dff7f458b","title":"going round in merkels papers spell out bleak prospects for brexit deal","story":"Front pages focus on Angela Merkel’s reportedly gloomy analysis but Times and FT suggest Irish talks offer last chance for JohnsonAnother dramatic day in the three-year long Brexit process, and another day of dramatic front pages.’s splash is “Day the deal was doomed” with No 10 sources suggesting that “talks are in tatters”. “Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan appeared all but dead last night as the government admitted there was little prospect of a deal before 31 October after a day of furious recriminations,” it reports.The Daily  is similarly pessimistic about prospects of an agreement – “Brexit deal now ‘essentially impossible’” – but lays the blame squarely at the feet of the EU, saying “Merkel’s insistence that Northern Ireland must stay aligned with EU is the death knell”, as Johnson allies “accused Angela Merkel of making a Brexit deal ‘essentially impossible’”.The i reports: “Brexit deal ‘impossible’ as EU leaders reject PM’s proposals”. The paper says Johnson has been accused “of playing ‘stupid blame game’”, while quoting UK officials who “insist Brussels has hardened its position as times runs out”.The FT focuses on the relationship between the PM and Irish leader Leo Varadkar, saying: “Johnson urges Varadkar to keep talking as Brexit deal hopes fade”. The paper reports that “Boris Johnson has urged Leo Varadkar to keep faith with talks on a possible Brexit deal, despite Downing Street fears that the prospects for an agreement before October 31 are all but dead”.The ’s front cover has a picture of the prime minister facing off against the German chancellor with the headline “We’re going around in Merkels”. The paper says that the “hope of a Brexit deal is more distant than ever”, with No 10 accusing Germany of “making impossible demands”, while the EU tells the UK to stop with its “‘stupid blame game’”.The Express reports “Brexit talks face collapse after Boris has bad-tempered phone call with German leader, blasting EU for making ‘impossible’ demands on Britain”.“That’s it then! PM’s angry clash spells end of deal,” is the paper’s headline.The Times is more hopeful, however, saying “Johnson gets last chance to keep Brexit deal alive”. The paper reports that a “vital meeting” between the PM and Irish leader Leo Varadkar could take place on Thursday, but does recognise Tuesday was not a good day for Johnson, saying he was “fighting to salvage his Brexit deal after an explosive row with Angela Merkel put talks on the brink of collapse”.The Mirror suggests Boris Johnson is to blame for breakdown in talks and has been “accused of sabotage”.

But it’s main story is “Cha cha chaps”, about the ITV decision to feature a male couple on the new series of Dancing on Ice, a move the paper says will “make telly history”.The Mail shifts its focus from Brexit and leads on what it has labelled the “dementia care scandal”, as 356,000 signed a petition urging Johnson to “fix a broken system that forces countless pensioners to sell their homes to fund crippling care costs”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b412b5bb766aa700775f5ce790b677172f4a0eb/0_283_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60fe19f302f5aa7680e41bcd7678faba","title":"parliament set for brexit showdown on 19 october","story":"Commons will sit two days after EU summit as concerns build over PM’s stance on Benn act MPs are heading for a Brexit showdown as they will be called to sit for a special parliamentary session on Saturday 19 October – less than two weeks before Britain’s scheduled departure from the EU.The sitting will happen two days after the EU summit and, with Boris Johnson’s attempts to strike a Brexit deal all but dead, is likely to be a decisive moment in determining the country’s future.Cabinet ministers are privately concerned at suggestions the prime minister may try to circumvent the Benn act – passed into law last month – which is aimed at forcing him to request a Brexit delay if he fails to reach a deal.According to the House of Commons website, Parliament has sat only four times on Saturdays in the past 80 years — including the day before the outbreak of World War Two, the Suez crisis in 1956 and for the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. Johnson has always insisted the country will leave the EU on 31 October but No 10 also says the prime minister will comply with the law.His hopes of securing a breakthrough in crunch Brexit talks were dealt another blow when the Irish finance minister said his government did not want any customs checks in Ireland.Paschal Donohoe denied his government was trying to trap Northern Ireland into a closer relationship with the EU and separate it from the UK by trying to prevent customs or tariff checks.Inside the EU, both Ireland and Northern Ireland are part of the single market and customs union so share the same regulations and standards, allowing a soft or invisible border between the two.Britain’s exit from the EU – taking Northern Ireland with it – risks a return to a hard or policed border. The only way to avoid this post-Brexit is for regulations on both sides to remain more or less the same in key areas including food, animal welfare, medicines and product safety.The \u0027backstop\u0027 in Theresa May\u0027s Withdrawal Agreement was intended to address this - stating that if no future trade agreement could be reached between the EU and the UK, then rules and regulations would stay as they are. This has been rejected by Brexit supporters as a \u0027trap\u0027 to keep the UK in the EU\u0027s customs union, which would prevent the UK striking its own independent trade deals.\u0026nbspInteractive: A typical hour in the life of the Irish borderJohnson is to meet the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday and try to persuade him to agree to plans which the British government argues need to include some form of Irish border checks, with a potential no-deal Brexit just weeks away.Asked whether his government held the position that there could not be any customs checks in Ireland, Donohoe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Firstly in terms of the charge that the Irish government is trying to trap anybody in any kind of arrangement, that is absolutely not the case.“We, of course, utterly respect the decision that the British people have made to leave the European Union, as a country that has much experience of referenda ourselves.“The so-called backstop was always an insurance policy but, equally, yes, you are correct to say that we do not want to see the return of customs checks and tariffs on our island.”Asked to clarify whether he meant he did not want customs checks anywhere, he replied: “Well, I would say on Ireland. The reason for that goes beyond economics, it goes beyond trade. It goes back to the kind of experience my country and I have gone through in my own lifetime where I have seen those kind of things and the erosion of the all-Ireland economy becoming a catalyst for the kind of political challenges on our island and in Ireland that I don’t want to return.”Pressed on what the point of Varadkar’s meeting with Johnson was, given the Irish position, he replied: “Because the stakes are so high that constructive engagement is the only choice, because the stakes of what this could mean not only for shared history between both countries that are so precious but for a shared future which we want to see continue in the future while we take our different journeys with respect to Europe.“It means, even with the short time that is left, of course the Irish government, of course the taoiseach, of course myself, we want to engage.”Asked to confirm whether the Irish would accept customs checks if they were enforced by the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit, he replied: “Well, what we have indicated is that if we are in a no-deal setting, we’ll have to put in place some kind of arrangements to ensure that we can give confidence to, for example, French shoppers that Irish lamb that is leaving Ireland is Irish lamb.”Asked to clarify whether some form of “arrangements” in effect meant a customs check, he said: “Well, we have to engage and we’re working with the European commission on what those things could be that will give confidence regarding the future of our economy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2a90f8e1c8acbd443f8a2d7dfc59493dc3af7fa/0_66_5750_3450/master/5750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba4a9da38f79c6e231bb34b74f5edd38","title":"adam silver nba china tv broadcasts hong kong","story":"The NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, said the league is not apologizing for Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey’s since-deleted tweet showing support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong, even after China’s state broadcaster canceled plans to show a pair of preseason games in that country later this week.Silver, speaking on Tuesday at a news conference in Tokyo before a preseason game between the Rockets and the Toronto Raptors, went as far as to say that he and the league are “apologetic” that so many Chinese officials and fans were upset by Morey’s tweet but insisted that the executive has the right to freedom of expression. The NBA has also received criticism from US politicians. Senator Ted Cruz said the league was guilty of “assisting Chinese censorship” by initially saying it was “regrettable” that Morey’s tweet had caused offence in China.Those consequences are already becoming clear. The state-run China Central Television (CCTV) said it would not show the games between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets, who will play on Thursday in Shanghai and Saturday in Shenzhen. Basketball is wildly popular in China, with the Lakers drawing particularly strong support due to the presence of superstar LeBron James“We’re strongly dissatisfied and oppose Adam Silver’s claim to support Morey’s right to freedom of expression,” CCTV said in a statement. “We believe that any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability are not within the scope of freedom of speech.” The broadcaster is also reviewing all its cooperation with the NBA, according to the statement.Chinese state media on Wednesday accused the NBA of endorsing violence with the China Daily accusing Silver of “brazenly endorsing Morey’s secessionist-supporting tweet” and giving “a shot to the arms of the rioters of Hong Kong”.The state-owned Global Times accused Silver of caving in to political pressure, saying the NBA was treating the Chinese market with disregard.Silver said the NBA did not expect CCTV to cancel plans to show the Lakers-Nets games. “But if those are the consequences of us adhering to our values, I still feel it’s very, very important to adhere to those values,” Silver said.The rift between China and the NBA started late last week when Morey tweeted a now-deleted image that read: “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,” in reference to months of pro-democracy demonstrations in the Chinese territory that has been mired in violence between protesters and law enforcement.Efforts were quickly made to defuse the impact. Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta said Morey does not speak for the Rockets, and Morey returned to Twitter on Monday in an effort to clarify his original post. NBA streaming partner Tencent which has a $1.5bn contract with the league over the next five seasons said it would not show Rockets games and a sports website in China said it was no longer covering the team.Further complicating the matter is the fact that China’s best-known basketball player is Hall of Famer Yao Ming, who spent his NBA career with the Rockets. Yao is now the president of the Chinese Basketball Association, which has said it is suspending its relationship with the Rockets in response to Morey’s tweet. The CBA also canceled plans to have the G League affiliates from Houston and Dallas play preseason games in China later this month. “I’m hoping that together Yao Ming and I can find an accommodation,” Silver said. “But he is extremely hot at the moment, and I understand it.”The NBA’s reaction to Chinese displeasure is jarring to some, given the fact that the league has won plaudits for encouraging its players to express their views on social issues they believe are important, such as police shootings of African Americans."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2019/10/08/Black.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7d7b89114df5b77d8ee915b3fb67f8e","title":"neil black stand down uk athletics alberto salazar mo farah","story":"The head of UK Athletics, Neil Black, is to quit at the end of this month after paying the price for his longstanding support of the banned US coach Alberto Salazar and his failure to hit his medal target at the recent World Athletics Championships.It is understood that Black was not officially sacked, but after seven years it appears that both sides accepted that it was time for a change.Black looked desperately downbeat in Doha after Britain won five medals and admitted he was considering his position. When pressed on Sunday about his future, however, he made it clear that his intention was to stay on for the Tokyo Olympics.Less than 48 hours later his departure was confirmed in a terse 44-word statement. “UK Athletics have announced that Neil Black will leave his role as performance director at the end of October.”“Neil will commence a detailed handover with performance staff until his departure and will fulfil his role supporting Mo Farah at this weekend’s Chicago Marathon.”The question of his replacement is an urgent one given the Games are nine months away, and several people are expected to throw their names into the ring. The head of Scottish athletics, Steven Maguire, who has performed miracles with Britain’s relay squad and is well-liked by athletes, would be a frontrunner if he is willing to move back to Loughborough.Another strong contender is Toni Minichiello, the former coach of Jessica Ennis-Hill. He will certainly have the backing of the grassroots but his reputation for straight-talking has not always endeared him to senior figures.A third name under consideration will be Mike Cavendish, who worked under Black at UK Athletics and has impressed as performance director at British Triathlon. Peter Eriksson, a former head coach of the UK Athletics Paralympic programmes, and Tommy Yule, the head of British weightlifting, have also been mentioned as contenders.The recruitment process is yet to start and in the short-term UK Athletics may decide to appoint an interim performance director, with Steve Paulding, the director of UK Athletics’ national performance centre, a possibility. Whoever gets the role will join an organisation in turmoil, with no chief executive for more than a year since the departure of Niels de Vos – although his replacement Zara Hyde Peters takes over soon – and an inexperienced new chairman, Chris Clark.Black becomes the first figure at UKA to pay the price for a relationship with Salazar – who was a performance consultant at UK Athletics between 2013 and 2017 – and he may not be the last.While there was no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part, Black gave his full backing to the American even after a BBC Panorama documentary in June 2015 suggested that Salazar had violated anti-doping laws, including using testosterone on his sons to see how much would flag a positive test.At the Beijing world championships two months later, Black confirmed that Salazar, who coached Farah between late 2010 and 2017, was still completely welcome in the team hotel, which raised eyebrows given a Usada investigation into the Nike Oregon Project, run by Salazar, was under way at that point.Previously, Black had hailed the American as a genius, adding that there was “total trust, total belief, total respect” between Salazar and the governing body.In fairness to Black, in 2015 an independent UK Athletics oversight committee led by the former athletes Jason Gardener, Sarah Rowell and Anne Wafula Strike, found there was “no reason to be concerned” by Salazar’s link with Farah and cleared the runner to continue working at the Nike Oregon Project. Gardener and Rowell remain on the UK board.The committee’s judgment has been questioned given Salazar’s former assistant coach Steve Magness, one of the 10 whistleblowers who went Usada to reveal their concerns with Salazar, called the review a sham.Like most of the previous incumbents, Black leaves a mixed legacy. Few doubt he was an excellent physiotherapist before moving up the ranks at UK Athletics to take the top job. However, he was criticised for his singular focus on medals – and Farah – at the expense of building a stronger coaching infrastructure for elite athletes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27ca24c949959157eb434e2df9d286ce52cbdca2/0_247_3708_2226/master/3708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c6aa9d05c13ceb6e253219d7eb7351b","title":"argentina sign off from rugby world cup with convincing win over us","story":"Argentina ended a disappointing World Cup campaign on a high as they ran in seven tries to hammer the United States 47-17 with a sometimes scintillating display in their final Pool C game. The Pumas, whose qualification hopes were ended by defeats at the hands of France and England, picked a young team and the newcomers took their chance to play with confidence and ambition that left the Americans clutching at shadows.There were two tries each for Joaquín Tuculet and man-of-the-match centre Juan Cruz Mallia, while recalled flyhalf Nicolás Sánchez, Jerónimo de la Fuente and Gonzalo Bertranou also scored to secure their ninth win in nine meetings with the US. They finish third in the pool with 11 points from their wins over Tonga and the US but that represented a considerable step backwards for the 2015 semi-finalists, especially on the back of such an impressive Super Rugby campaign by the Jaguares.The US, who have now managed only three wins in their 26 World Cup games, will hope to end with a fourth from their final game against Tonga but will have to dramatically improve their defence after missing almost 50 tackles on Wednesday.Argentina were on top from the start and Mallia set up the first try when he cut through a ragged American defensive line to feed Sánchez on his shoulder after 19 minutes. Sánchez then set up the second as his short kick took a horrible bounce to wrong-foot Mike Te’o and give Tuculet an unexpected second, followed soon after by his own second and the team’s third.The Americans got on the scoreboard at the end of the half when flyhalf AJ MacGinty sent a grubber kick into the corner for captain Blaine Scully to scamper on to and touch down.Bautista Delguy had the crowd on their feet at the start of the second half with an outrageous run from behind his own line and through half a dozen defenders all the way to the halfway line. He was unable to complete but the next score was only minutes away as Mallia, again untouched, got the fourth, and soon after, and identical fifth after a quick lineout caught the Americans napping.It was then De La Fuente’s turn to run in unharried. The Americans kept going and were rewarded when Paul Lasike showed great strength to smash his way over for their second try. Bertranou then became the latest to benefit from more great work by Mallia but the US had the final word with Scully’s second."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/987ef0cfabe12668707fed884dac20588371defd/174_110_2652_1592/master/2652.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8ef9ac4673280bf08b0cb4891e4c3eb","title":"scotland russia rugby world cup match report","story":"That’s the easy part done, the hard bit is still to come.

They started to run out of steam around 10 minutes in, when Adam Hastings scored the first try by slipping through their midfield with a cute dummy and a sidestep. Two minutes after the restart, Hastings chipped the ball ahead, chased it down himself, then hacked it on again beyond the Russian tryline. Their full-back, Vasily Artemyev, should have beaten him to it, but lost his footing and fell over sideways.The third try was even worse. Russia won a lineout deep in their own 22, and their scrum-half, Dmitry Petrov, shot a long flat pass straight towards George Horne, who caught the ball and ed over the line while the Russians stood around staring at each other. They did manage to hold off the Scottish maul when they rolled forward in the final minutes of the half, but Scotland soon picked up that vital fourth try when Darcy Graham beat three tacklers with a sidewinding run that covered half the length of pitch. Horne finished it off for him.•\u0026nbspFixtures, tables and results• Top try and points scorers•\u0026nbspSign up to The Breakdown, our free rugby union email newsletterIt turned into a turkey shoot. There was a fifth by Gordon Turner, peeling off a maul, a sixth by Tommy Seymour, chasing down Blair Kinghorn’s grubber, and a seventh for Horne, who completed his hat-trick by finishing off a fine free-flowing counterattack from the halfway line. John Barclay got the eighth, and Stuart McInally the ninth and last.By then Russia had pretty much given up tackling. It was more satisfying, perhaps, that the Scots have now played 192 minutes without conceding a single point, which is a World Cup record.

They looked utterly spent, and turned in their worst game yet. Much more here: The rugby isn’t over for the day quite yet: Barry Glendenning is on the Wales v Fiji beat here:All the vital pool tables and results and stuff have been lovingly collated for you here:Russia’s captain, Vasily Artemyev, has been presented with a brand new No15 shirt while his team-mates gather around applauding. He probably doesn’t need any more No15 shirts, but it’s the thought that counts.They played some excellent rugby. That first 10-15 minutes of the game was very competitive. Russia were here to play, they moved the ball wide, we know how physical they are, they challenge well, the breakdowns, so we had to put a really resilient performance together and take the gaps when they started to appear. It was an excellent performance and shows the depth that we have. I thought Adam Hastings brought a really good balance to his game. Some excellent kicking in the first half put pressure on the Russians, so they had to play from deep, and then his running game and link play was excellent. Still a few areas to improve, but both him and George Horne combined very well.We’ll see what happens on Saturday now with the Samoa-Ireland game, because that is a factor if Ireland don’t get maximum points and it could be a three-way tie. But we know we have to win and we have to win by seven clear points if we’re going to get into the last eight, and that’ll be a big challenge because Japan are a very good team and have had a pretty good rest going into this game.So Scotland have won their last two games by an aggregate score of 95-0, and that’s despite having two tries ruled out here for slightly forward passes (though ITV are currently arguing that George Horne’s fourth try should have stood). There was some excellent play here, with Darcy Graham’s fantastic run for the all-important fourth try the highlight.We enjoyed that one. To be honest we were a little bit nervous coming into the game because of what we’d seen Russia do to other teams in the tournament. So we prepared really well. I was proud of the boys, really professional, stuck to how we wanted to play the game and it was a good result. The Japan game wasn’t on our minds at all, to be honest. I think we’d have been doing a disservice to Russia if we’d done that. I spoke to the boys in the week, if we have one eye on Japan it’s easy to take your eye off this game. Certainly the guys who were playing were very focused on this game.81 mins: Time for one more try! Adam Hastings touches down! But again the final pass, this time from Tommy Seymour, went forwards and it’s chalked off! The game ends with Hastings’ head in his hands as the hat-trick is ripped from his grasp.79 mins: Again excellent from Adam Hastings.78 mins: Good work from Duncan Taylor on the left helps Scotland surge into Russian space, and when the ball is worked to the right Stuart McInally manages to sprint to the line before Dmitrii Gerasimov can bring him down!76 mins: A try for the captain, John Barclay! He runs the final 30m against nonexistent opposition. The final defender, German Davydov, just stands still and ushers him past. Hopeless from Russia, who allow Barclay to touch down between the posts and give Hastings an easy conversion.74 mins: Iurii Kushnarev rampages down the left for a while, signs of life and ambition still for Russia. But once he’s tackled, they lose the ball in short order.72 mins: There has been a discernible loss of intensity in the last few minutes. Russia concede a penalty for a no-arms tackle on Hastings. They could probably have banked the points but Scotland kick to touch, in search of another try.69 mins: Russia lose another line-out. Their World Cup is not so much ending as unravelling.65 mins: It’s chalked off. That was a poor mistake from Bradbury, who fluffed a completely straightforward pass. Not that it matters much at this stage.64 mins: Russia are once again sliced open by a surging Scot. This time it’s WP Nel, who does his best impression of a sprinter for a while before offloading. The ball is worked left where Bradbury feeds Horne for another. It looked like the final pass went forwards, but will it be checked? 60 mins: At the seventh attempt, Hastings finally misses a conversion.59 mins: Ramil Gaisin kicks clear, but within moments Russia are falling apart again! Pete Horne starts the rampage, passing inside to Henry Pyrgos, and he draws the final defender before feeding Horne to administer the coup de grace!57 mins: That was an extremely difficult conversion made to look completely straightforward by a player brimming with confidence. Adam Hastings has had an immaculate evening.55 mins: Two kicks lead to a sixth try. Duncan Taylor with the first, which travels 40m or so and rolls around a bit before being kicked away by Russia and into touch. Scotland take it quickly and Kinghorn prods through another kick which rolls conveniently down the right flank without ever quite making it into touch, and Tommy Seymour sprints onto it to touch down!52 mins: Turns out Russia’s defence is extremely flimsy. Scotland have scored some far too straightforward tries today, and that was another.51 mins: A fifth try! And a first from a forward, as Scotland drive forwards before George Turner spins out of the maul with the ball in his hands and sprints to the line!49 mins: Scotland threaten again, only for Kinghorn to fluff the final offload.48 mins: Graham is immediately removed from the fray, to bask in the glory of that fabulous run.46 mins: A successful conversion from Hastings, wide on the left. It had been an inauspicious start to the second half, until Graham sent it blooming into brilliant life.45 mins: It’s the try they wanted! And what a run from Darcy Graham! He catches a kick deep inside his own half, skips through any number of tiny slivers of space and finally presents George Horne with the final 10 metres of empty grass!41 mins: Not a great start: Kinghorn’s kick doesn’t travel the requisite 10 metres, so Russia have a scrum on the centre spot.The players are back out, and Blair Kinghorn preparing to get the game restarted.If Scotland haven’t been perfect, they have at least made no significant missteps, and capitalised ruthlessly on their opponents’. Russia’s best chance was always to be strong defensively, maintaining that even if the Scots scored a single try, and capitalise on Scottish desperation when their four-try target started to look out of reach. Instead they conceded one try and then crumbled."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e296b2d24eb55bba471abec424548c08a9c118a/0_0_3225_1935/master/3225.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52556687a983a23a7d6c7b63b4b88891","title":"wales v fiji rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"Assistant referees: Romain Poite (France) and Karl Dickson (England)The only other upset of the pool stage saw Urugay beat Fiji Glorious though this was, it was not the upset a neutral might have chosen. Fiji are a side packed full of first‑class talent, who many fancied to make the quarter-finals. Alas, they are now reduced to trying to throw a ner in someone else’s works (Wales’s). Otherwise, the key game in this pool was Wales-Australia, won by the former in just the sort of bloody-minded fashion they have made their own lately.What’s still at stake? Fiji may yet throw that ner on Wednesday but it would be of limited use to them. Wales finish against Uruguay on Sunday and will surely take maximum points. In which case it would be Australia who likely benefit, the Wallabies finishing with a game against Georgia on Friday. An upset there is not quite out of the question, but it would be big – of Tonga‑France-in-2011 proportions, if not quite Brighton 2015. If Wales beat Fiji (and they are currently 17-point favourites to do so) they will top the group with a win over Uruguay, which would pitch Australia into the England‑New Zealand side of the draw. Fiji look safe for third place, which would mean Georgia back on the qualification beat for 2023.England and Scotland’s pool deciders this weekend are under threat from one of the most violent super typhoons in recent history, potentially causing chaos for tens of thousands of travelling supporters.World Rugby may be forced into taking the unprecedented step of cancelling Saturday’s Pool C match between England and France as well as Scotland’s crucial fixture with Japan 24 hours later as the category five super typhoon heads for Yokohama. Both matches were among the most in-demand when tickets went on sale.Gerard Meagher has the latest from Tokyo ... The 40,000-capacity Oita Stadium on Kyushu Island is the venue for today’s Pool D showdown between Wales and Fiji, where the teams will do battle under a closed roof that has been the cause of much humidity during previous games played in this tournament. At times during New Zealand’s match against Canada, the ball was more slippery than a wet bar of soap. Wales are already assured of a quarter-final place, but a win today followed by victory over Uruguay on Sunday would guarantee them top spot and help them avoid the England-New Zealand half of the draw. Following their surprise defeat at the hands of Uruguay, Fiji cannot can’t qualify for the quarter-finals but look good to finish in third spot.

At 77.8mm it is hand-stretchingly wide, wider still than the already massive OnePlus 7 Pro (75.9mm) and even the positively gigantic Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ (75.9mm), and at 226g it is heavier than competitors by a full 20g. But more than that, the rounded stainless steel sides provide no grip at all, meaning your fingers simply slip off them when you stretch across to reach the other side of the screen or the top left corner, which you frequently need to do in iOS.It’s a combination that either results in hand pain or wallet pain, as it slips out of your fingers and plummets on to the unforgiving floor below. You then stick it in a case, which makes it even bigger. If there was ever a phone to benefit from a grip accessory of some kind, this is it.So unless you have giant hands, the iPhone 11 Pro Max is exclusively a two-handed phone. But I’d argue that there are always times when you need to use a phone one-handed: public transport, carrying a bag, taking a selfie and so on.The 6.5in Super Retina XDR “Pro level” OLED screen is just as wonderful as the one on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro, although it isn’t a massive leap over that fitted to significantly cheaper rivals such as the OnePlus 7 Pro. Flip it over and the frosted, almost metallic-like glass and square camera lump with three lenses poking out is new.The iPhone 11 Pro Max has the same A13 Bionic chip, 4GB of RAM and at least 64GB of storage as the rest of the iPhone 11 line, and performs similarly. Everything happens promptly, including intensive tasks such as video editing and gaming, and it should be a top performer for years to come.The use of Lightning over the newer, more adaptable and useful USB-C is disappointing, as is the 64GB of starting storage. If you want to use your massive phone screen to watch video or play games, or you shoot any number of photos or 4K videos, you’re going to fill that up in no time.Apple says it has managed to make the iPhone 11 Pro last five hours longer between charges than the iPhone XS Max, which managed 27 hours in my testing.The iPhone 11 Pro Max beats that estimate by some margin, lasting just minutes shy of a full 48 hours between charges. That means the phone lasts from 7am on day one until about 6.50am on day three, propelling the iPhone 11 Pro Max into the two-day battery club previously only populated by a variety of Huawei’s top phones.That was after the iOS 13.1.2 update, while using it as my primary device without a smartwatch attached, sending and receiving 100 emails and messages, 80 push notifications, listening to five hours of music on Bluetooth headphones, watching an hour of Netflix, and shooting about 10 photos a day.The phone also gets pretty hot when fast charging. It can wirelessly charge too, but can’t charge other devices.The iPhone 11 Pro shipped with iOS 13 but was quickly updated three times to iOS 13.1.2, following the same issues suffered with the iPhone 11.Dark mode, swipe typing on the Apple keyboard, improved quick setting access and menstrual cycle tracking are all new highlights of iOS 13.The iPhone 11 Pro Max also has a few additions for the large screen such as a split-screen view in Mail, Calendar, Messages and others that aren’t present on the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. It also supports a few tricks to help with one-handed use such as bringing the top of the screen down or moving the keyboard to one of the sides, which itself is difficult to do with your right hand as the button to activate it is in the bottom left corner of the screen.It’s the back gesture, which is a swipe in from the left edge of the screen, that’s a killer for a right-handed user. Trying to do that with one hand is equal parts frustration and dread.Apple leads the industry in software updates, providing at least five years of support from release, where other manufacturers cap out at about three years, and has recently shown a surprising ability to rapidly push out bug fix updates in quick succession.The iPhone 11 Pro Max has Apple’s new triple 12-megapixel camera setup – the same as the smaller iPhone 11 Pro. The combination of ultrawide, wide and telephoto cameras gives you the ability to shoot at 0.5x, 1x or 2x optical zoom, then up to 10x digital zoom.Overall, it’s a massive step up on previous iPhone cameras, and better still than the cheaper iPhone 11. Apple’s new night mode brings it up to par with the best rivals on very low-light photography, while the new deep fusion technology rolling out with iOS 13.2 is getting closer than ever to the clarity of fine detail of an SLR with a large lens.The photos used for this review were all shot on an iPhone 11 Pro running iOS 13.2 beta.After lagging the ultra-competitive camera competition for some time, Apple is firmly up with the best with the iPhone 11 Pro line.There’s an excellent super-sized smartphone within Apple’s grasp, but unfortunately the iPhone 11 Pro Max isn’t it.A design that works at the much smaller size of the 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro simply doesn’t at the gargantuan 6.5in iPhone 11 Pro Max, meaning Apple’s biggest phone suffers from terrible ergonomics.I get that uniformity is Apple’s schtick, but in this case it actively makes the product worse. Of all the massive phones I’ve used across the years, the heavy, slippery iPhone 11 Pro Max and iPhone XS Max before it are the only ones to give me serious hand pain. It’s literally a crying shame, because everything else about it – from the camera, the screen and the performance – is great.When it comes down to it, only the genuinely epic Huawei-level battery life salvages the iPhone 11 Pro Max from being a three-star product, and even then this is a four-star phone that is extremely expensive.There are certainly better, easier-to-use big-screen smartphones available that cost significantly less than the jaw-dropping £1,149 and up Apple wants for the iPhone 11 Pro Max.But if you must have an iPhone and the wonderful 5.8in iPhone 11 Pro doesn’t quite cut it, do yourself a favour and save £420 and buy the 6.1in iPhone 11. Only those that genuinely need two-day battery life should buy the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and even then I wouldn’t.Cons: hard to hold, heavy, super expensive, no headphone socket, no fingerprint scanner, no headphones adapter in the box, low starting storage This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Meat-lovers should book the bistro-like Gaston, whose friendly owner, Rachid, serves traditional dishes such as oeufs en meurette (eggs poached in a rich red wine sauce) or aged prime rib with a béarnaise sauce (lunch menu €20). For more veggie-friendly dishes (plat du jour €10-€12), there is the casual Bar Pignon, while Formaticus is a fromagerie that serves sharing plates from its long list of cheeses and Le Costaud des Batignolles is part modern art gallery, part restaurant.The ideal introduction to Batignolles is to grab a pavement table at Dose and order a flat white, or its signature filter coffee. This self-proclaimed “Dealer de Café” is part of a wave of local cafes with a focus on barista skills, which are finally opening up in Paris – and offering an alternative to the bitter “express” many neighbourhood places serve. The location is perfect, opposite the entrance of the Square des Batignolles park (see below), so the clientele is a mix of parents with kids, shoppers taking time out from the nearby boutiques, and students and clubbers who roll up around midday for organic ginger juice, chocolat chaud and croissants.• Flat white €4, hot chocolate from €3.50, pastries from €1.50, 82 Place du Docteur Félix Lobligeois, dose.parisMore of a sprawling park than a simple square, this is the prime green space in the Batignolles, created in 1862 as a landscaped jardin à l’anglaise. A stream runs through manicured lawns, past statues and sculptures, then into a large pond filled with red Japanese carp and scores of ducks. It’s great for a picnic, and perfect for kids, as there are playgrounds, skateboard slopes and an old-fashioned carousel with wooden horses. In the early evening, older locals gather to play pétanque before going to a nearby bistro.• 144bis rue Cardinet, paris.frFrance’s first museum dedicated to street art is in a corner of the Batignolles, just by the péripherique ring road. It is in an IT college, and visiting is not easy (compulsory guided tours every other Tuesday 6pm-8pm, free, online booking essential) but it is worth the effort. This display of the private collection of Parisian gallerist Nicolas Laugero Lasserre s 150 artworks by some 50 graffiti artists from across the world, including Invader, Shepard Fairey, Monkey Bird, Lek and Banksy. The college is worth a visit in itself: it’s open 24 hours a day, with facilities for students to sleep and shower on site, no fees, and no professors. Instead, there are just hundreds of students, day and night, huddled over computer screens, with the street art taking up most of the wall space.• 96 Boulevard Bessières, art42.frDorothée XX’s quirky concept store is typical of the shopping jewels to be found on the Batignolles’ narrow streets. You won’t find famous-name designers or global brands in this neighbourhood, but this eclectic boutique is a goldmine of clothing, accessories, jewellery, ceramics and objets handpicked by Dorothée from more than 50 lesser-known French designers. A few minutes walk away, on rue Boursault, is a similar French-style concept store, Les Passantes, but here you can also take a break from shopping – ordering tea and homemade cakes in its chic salon de thé.• 96 rue Nollet, desordreurbain.frAsk anyone in the long queue that invariably forms outside this hole-in-the-wall joint and they will say it serves the best kebab in Paris. Don’t be fooled by the name, this isn’t a restaurant – there’s not even a bar to eat standing up at. But the Square des Batignolles is a two-minute walk away, perfect for a picnic. The secret here is the quality of the veal that is prepared each day by the owners, brothers Ozlan and Erlan, marinated for 24 hours, then served from 11am till 9.30pm. It’s worth putting up with the long queue for a memorable €6.50 doner kebab.• 43 rue des Batignolles, no websiteOpened a few months ago, this smart, minimalist restaurant is set to be the new gourmet reference point in the Batignolles. Chef Thibaut Spiwack worked with celebrated chefs such as Alain Ducasse before opening his own restaurant, and it seems likely that the 2020 Michelin Guide will give him his first star. Although the evening is reserved for a gastronomic five-course tasting menu (€75) lunchtime is the perfect time to try Thibaut’s creative cuisine (three courses €29). Expect creative cocktails and a fine selection of organic and biodynamic wines, house-baked bread, seasonal locavore ingredients and dishes such as tuna tatami with strawberry and basil sorbet, or roast hake on a bed smoked potatoes.• 80 Boulevard des Batignolles, anona.frThe Batignolles covered market dates back to 1846, when this neighbourhood was a rural village. Although the present premises are an ugly 1970s concrete construction, there is a buzz about it the moment you walk amid the crowded stalls. Apart from the tempting fish, cheese and charcuterie on offer, there are affordable sit down lunches at several cosmopolitan canteens: Lebanese meze at Edgar set menu Japanese at Onigiriya and Senegalese maffé (peanut stew) and yassa (spicy marinated chicken or fish) at Madame Absa’s stall. Every Saturday morning there is also an outdoor organic farmers’ market on nearby Boulevard des Batignolles.

A special education student at Montezuma Elementary school in Albuquerque, Urijah often came home from school upset, but he seemed particularly rattled.His mother, Nadia McGilbert, drew a bath to help him relax and discovered his injuries: a deep, avocado-shaped bruise on his forearm and scratches, apparently from sharp fingernails, on both arms.“Oh my God,” she sputtered. “Is this what they did to you at school?”Urijah nodded and said it hurt to breathe. At UNM Hospital’s emergency room, doctors confirmed her worst suspicions. According to their discharge notes, Urijah’s injuries were sustained when teachers placed him in a “team control position”: a technique in which two adults pull a child’s arms behind his or her torso and force the head downward.“You couldn’t imagine the pain,” said Urijah. “Like, it feels like you’re being pulled apart.”Such instances of restraint and seclusion are supposed to be rare, but it was at least the 150th time Urijah had been placed in a hold by school teachers in less than four years, according to a Searchlight analysis of his education records.Often referred to as “therapeutic holding” or “physical management,” restraint is a controversial and dangerous method of behavior management. In 2017, New Mexico joined 29 other states in passing a law setting tight limits on the use of restraint and seclusion, which allows its use only in extreme circumstances – when a child poses an immediate physical threat to themselves or others.The law put strict reporting requirements on schools, mandating that parents be immediately notified of any incident. But a 10-month investigation by Searchlight New Mexico has revealed that it’s still widely used to manage special education students, and parents are often left in the dark.In most cases, teachers only use restraint and seclusion when they feel a student’s behavior is so dangerous that there is no other alternative. But amid staff shortages, inadequate training, and a lack of clear guidance from Albuquerque Public Schools leadership, teachers sometimes use restraint and seclusion as a first response to moderate, non-threatening misbehavior, according to both education and legal records.Data from APS’s behavior management computer system indicates that there have been at least 4,600 cases of restraint since 2014, but six teachers interviewed by Searchlight say that number is certainly an undercount because many incidents are never entered into the system.Hundreds of deaths from restraint have been documented in schools, psychiatric facilities, residential homes and other settings across the country, according to reports by the Government Accountability Office, Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, National Center for Disability Rights and others.In its reporting to the federal government, however, APS has consistently – and falsely – denied that it uses restraint at all.Schools superintendent Raquel Reedy, associate superintendent for Special Education Lucinda Sánchez, Director of compliance Cindy Soo Hoo, and Lila Ramirez, who oversees APS’s behavior tracking system, all declined to comment for this story.Searchlight spoke with dozens of parents, as well as teachers, educational assistants, students and three attorneys. Searchlight also reviewed over 5,000 pages of educational and legal records, and filed multiple public records requests.Yet school superintendents and administrators who defend the restraint and seclusion of special education students say the techniques are necessary to manage behavior.“We believe the use of seclusion and restraint has enabled many students with serious emotional or behavioral conditions to be educated not only within our public schools, but also in the least restrictive and safest environments possible,” declared the American Association of School Administrators in a 2012 position paper, Keeping Schools Safe: How Seclusion and Restraint Protects Students and School Personnel.Every one of APS’s 143 schools is supposed to have its own restraint team, according to numerous lawyers, teachers and parents. The “physical crisis team,” as it’s frequently called, consists of teachers and other staff who have received training from Crisis Prevention Institute, a private Milwaukee-based company.Urijah’s first restraint by a school crisis team happened in October 2015 at Arroyo del Oso Elementary, two months into his first-grade year. Diagnosed with developmental delay, sensory processing disorder, receptive and expressive language disorder and emotional disturbance, he had been growing increasingly overwhelmed in class and tried repeatedly to flee school.Intercepted by staff, he began kicking and swinging his arms in protest – which is when, according to teachers notes, the school’s behavior management specialist placed the then-6-year-old in a restraint hold.Before the school year was up, he had been suspended four times and restrained at least seven more. In March, Arroyo del Oso’s principal informed his mother that the school could no longer handle her son.APS transferred Urijah to Governor Bent Elementary school, where he was restrained by teachers on his first day of class, according to school records provided to Searchlight by his mother. Staff restrained him at least another 18 times in a little more than two months, before administrators informed McGilbert they would be transferring Urijah to Montezuma Elementary.Those numbers are based on data obtained by Pegasus Legal Services, a nonprofit Albuquerque children’s law firm. APS did not fulfill public records requests filed by Searchlight for more recent data.By the end of Urijah’s first year at Montezuma, staff had restrained him more than 100 times. On many occasions, McGilbert said she received no notification from the school. Nor did staff hold a meeting with a parent, as required by state law, to craft a plan to avoid future restraints.“My stomach was in knots every morning,” said McGilbert. “I could barely walk to the car to drive him to school, because I didn’t know if he would get hurt in class again.”In more than 50 interviews conducted for this story, parents echoed McGilbert’s frustration.Sarah Bateman-Twocrow, whose 8-year-old son Arnold was restrained “almost daily” at Montezuma and other schools, according to his inidualized education plan, has tried for years to get comprehensive documentation from the district.Often, she said, Arnold would come home with bruising on his arms, unable to articulate what had caused them on one occasion, she arrived at school to pick him up only to see him being pinned to the ground by three adults.“I was in shock,” Bateman-Twocrow recalled. “There are no words to describe the feeling of seeing your child being restrained by a group of grown men.”In the course of this investigation, Searchlight worked with 22 parents, including Bateman-Twocrow, to request documentation of their children’s restraint and seclusion at 29 Albuquerque schools. APS did not fulfill any of those requests.APS also did not respond to Searchlight’s questions about the parents’ requests. Over the years, when pressed in court and in administrative hearings, district officials have maintained that collecting data on restraint and seclusion would be too labor intensive.APS is required to report every instance of restraint and seclusion to the US Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection, or CRDC, ision. But for the past 10 years, district leadership has claimed no incidents of restraint in any of APS’s schools, CRDC data shows. That same data claims that there have been only four cases of seclusion since 2009, only one of which involved a student with disabilities.Andy Gutierrez, senior director of APS Student Information Systems, confirmed that the district again claimed no instances for the 2017-2018 school year, the most recent year for which reporting was required.“The Albuquerque Public Schools district … does not use this form of discipline disposition in our schools or programs and there is no discipline code for restraint or seclusion in our Student Information System (SIS),” Gutierrez wrote in an email to Searchlight in May.A recent report from the US Government Accountability Office found that districts across the country vastly underreport their use of restraint and seclusion to the Department of Education, making it difficult for the federal government to enforce civil rights protections.“There might be a rare emergency circumstance where restraint could be necessary,” said George Davis, former director of psychiatry for the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department. “But if the same emergency happens over and over again, it’s just not an emergency – it’s poor planning, and it’s failure to respond to the kid’s needs. The fact that it continues to be standard operating procedure is beyond negligent.”With special education classrooms overcrowded and understaffed, many APS teachers report that they are left unprepared. All teachers interviewed for this story said they were never informed of the 2017 state law or the guidelines it sets on the use of restraint and seclusion.“I’ve lost sleep over this,” said Sonya Romero-Smith, who teaches both special education and general education kindergartners at Lew Wallace Elementary in Albuquerque. “No teacher wants to be in a position where they might hurt a child. This is not what I signed up to do.”As Urijah nears the end of his time in elementary school, his mother is worried about his transition to sixth grade.“He doesn’t trust anyone at school, and why should he?” McGilbert said. “It’s been trauma after trauma. He’s never had the chance to just be a kid.”This investigation was published in partnership with Searchlight New Mexico"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80a76757ed7d637f25ce3a9d343b19a0e257474f/0_423_3128_1878/master/3128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5278b10cd4d0c8adf2064388dec0451b","title":"us immigration ice asylum seeker detention rolando","story":"Rolando, an indigenous man who survived a shooting and torture in Guatemala, was suffering blinding headaches when he arrived in the USSome days, Rolando would bleed out of his eyes, ears and nose. Other days, he’d lie on the floor, dizzy or barely conscious.But every time the jailed Guatemalan asylum seeker sought help from a doctor, staff at his US immigration detention center offered the same treatment: ibuprofen.The 27-year-old migrant survived a gunshot wound to the head in Guatemala and was suffering from excruciating headaches and possible brain hemorrhaging when he presented himself at the San Ysidro port of entry earlier this year. US authorities responded by isolating him in solitary confinement and jailing him for months at the Otay Mesa detention center in San Diego, giving him sporadic access to medical staff and medicine, his records show.“I feared I was going to die,” Rolando, who asked not to use his full name due to threats against his life, told the . “I thought in this country, there is really good medical care … but I wasn’t getting any treatment.”Rolando made it out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention alive, but his battle isn’t over. He’s still fighting to get asylum, based on the physical torture and persecution he fled as an indigenous Guatemalan. Every step of his journey has collided with the Trump administration’s aggressive attacks and expanding restrictions on migrants and refugees.Now, the White House is moving to block Central Americans like Rolando from presenting their cases at the border, a move that experts agree will have devastating and fatal consequences.“I came to the United States because I’d like to at least make it to 30,” Rolando said.When he met the  on a recent morning, Rolando carried the charger for his ankle monitor, which asylum seekers awaiting hearings are frequently forced to wear. He’s often worried about it running out of battery.Seated inside the small legal services office of Al Otro Lado, above a pizza shop in San Diego, Rolando looked down and wove a bracelet with his hands as he talked, a practice he developed inside detention to pass the time and distract from his health problems. His native Mayan language is Qʼeqchiʼ, but he talks to his attorney in Spanish, which he was forced to speak in jail.Rolando was born into chaos in 1992 in the Petén region of northern Guatemala. His father had been a member of the armed forces but resigned and became a supporter of the pro-indigenous movement. He was killed as a result, just after Rolando’s birth, and his mother died soon after “from the trauma”, he said.He was an orphan at age one: “My brothers and sisters couldn’t take care of me … and they gave me to neighbors.”Rolando became homeless and later a frequent target of violence by the people who he believes killed his father. Police tortured him when he sought help. According to his asylum application, that included placing nails in his hand and foot and burning his arms with hot knives.In 2016, while at a soccer game, assailants shot Rolando in the head and left him with a written death threat that referenced his father’s murder. He survived, was forced into hiding and was unable to get medical attention. He said he had to remove the bullet himself. Police later refused to help and assaulted him, according to his file.“I don’t have anyone left,” he said, adding that fleeing to the US was his only option: “Giving me an opportunity to be here is giving me an opportunity to stay alive.”He escaped to Mexico and joined a caravan last year, eventually making it to Tijuana. Then the waiting began.As part of a vast crackdown on migration, border patrol under Trump has instituted a policy known as “metering”, which limits the number of people who can apply for asylum each day. In Tijuana, this has led to a waitlist that has more than 10,000 people, with a few dozen allowed to cross daily, creating a wait time of roughly six to nine months, lawyers estimate.Trump’s “Remain in Mexico” policy has also resulted in nearly 50,000 migrants from Central America being returned to Mexico while their cases move forward. That has translated to overcrowded shelters, tent encampments and a struggle to access medical and legal services.It also leaves migrants like Rolando vulnerable to the same violence they were escaping in their home countries. Rolando said he was beaten in Tijuana, suffering injuries to both his arms and forcing him to wear a cast.In February, he was finally able to enter the US through the San Ysidro port of entry. In his initial processing, authorities took his injured arms – and placed him in handcuffs.Once he was in custody, Rolando’s health problems worsened. More than 150 pages of Ice’s medical records paint a picture of repeated health crises and his persistent struggle to get help.Rolando regularly was bleeding from his eyes, ears and nose – the cause of which was unclear to doctors but might have been related to his gunshot wound. Rolando said he was bleeding soon after he was taken into custody and that as a result, he was placed in isolation: “They said, ‘We don’t know what’s wrong with you.’”It’s unclear how many days he spent in solitary, but he said he had difficulty getting any treatment while isolated, and that he would spend all day in a small cell with no window to the outside. Staff would pass him meals through a small slat.“I didn’t even know what was night and what was day,” he recalled. “I was sick already, but I was starting to get worse … Nobody was coming to see me.”Once in the general population of Otay Mesa, Rolando continued to suffer periodic bleeding, and at times his head pain was so severe, he would lose consciousness, or he would lie on the ground so that he would not injure himself if he passed out.Rolando would frequently sign up for “sick call” to visit medical staff, but he said the appointments did little to help. Records show that on one visit, a nurse told him to drink more water and “wash hairhead thoroughly”.Eating the facility’s meats also started to make him sick, but he often struggled to get alternative food options, even though the medical staff said he needed to change his diet. Sometimes he made bracelets and sold them to other detainees so he could buy instant soup, he recalled.The records show that the main form of treatment Rolando received was prescriptions for ibuprofen – in increasingly high doses as his pain worsened. Sometimes, he said, he ran out of ibuprofen and had difficulty getting a refill. He also received an ointment for his eyes.Anne Rios, his attorney with Al Otro Lado, said she was stunned when she was finally able to get a copy of his medical records: “It seems unbelievable, almost too absurd to be true, but it’s not only documented, it’s the government’s own records.”By August, Ice had twice refused to release him while his asylum case was pending even after dozens of medical visits, including multiple to the emergency room. One ER doctor had written that he was a “serious patient that presents with significant complexity of risk”, adding that he might have some kind of brain hemorrhage.He had no criminal history or immigration violations.Rolando grew increasingly desperate. At one point, he considered giving up and deporting himself back to Guatemala – a certain death, Rios said, recalling him telling her on one visit: “‘I’m gonna die here or in Guatemala, so I would at least rather go to my home country … I just can’t take it any more.’”After a third request by Rolando’s attorneys, a judge ruled that he could be released – but only if he paid a $5,000 bond.“For many, $5,000 might as well be $5m,” said Rios. “They come here with nothing, no resources, no family members, absolutely no way to pay for that.”Rolando was only able to get out when Al Otro Lado found a way to cover the amount through its bond fund.Ice declined to comment on Rolando’s case, citing his privacy. A spokeswoman said “everyone in our custody receives timely access to medical services and treatment”, including a full health assessment with two weeks of custody, daily sick calls and 24-hour emergency care. A dietician ensures detainees’ “unique health (included allergies), dietary, and religious needs are met” for each meal, and all food “must be visually appealing, palatable, and taste good”.Rolando struggles to understand why the US has treated him like a criminal: “I followed all the rules and I asked for admission.”Trump, however, is working to make the asylum process much more restrictive than what Rolando has experienced. His administration passed a policy in July banning migrants from seeking asylum at the US-Mexico border if they came from another country, saying they must first seek protections elsewhere.The supreme court ruled last month that Trump’s ban could go into effect while legal challenges continued.Rolando was released in September and is awaiting an asylum hearing scheduled for next week. He said he wanted to speak out because he was particularly upset about the treatment he saw other detainees face at Otay Mesa. Some were disabled and unable to walk to the cafeteria to get food, he said, noting that he got reprimanded when he tried to bring them food.“They abuse their power with us,” he said.Otay Mesa has repeatedly faced accusations of severe medical neglect. Last week, a detainee died in custody.Rolando said he wanted the government to understand that people seek asylum because they have no other option – and that officials should believe him: “When you’re asking for asylum, you’re swearing to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. I am telling the truth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a84ed0a22d77ac1b46d56834e2fcb2ece56afd5/0_125_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5eca3690084b147470f46e9acf40fba","title":"us restricts visas chinese officials uighurs muslim minorities","story":"The US has imposed visa restrictions on Chinese government and Communist party officials accused of being involved in the mass internment of more than a million Uighurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang province.The restrictions, announced by the state department on Tuesday, come a day after the US commerce department imposed export restrictions on US companies preventing them from selling their products – particularly face recognition and other surveillance technology – to 28 Chinese entities, including the Public Security Bureau and firms involved in surveillance in Xinjiang.“China has forcibly detained over one million Muslims in a brutal, systematic campaign to erase religion and culture in Xinjiang. China must end its draconian surveillance and repression, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease its coercion of Chinese Muslims abroad, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said in a statement.The US punitive measures mark the first time China has been held to account internationally for its programme of mass incarceration and persecution of religious minorities.The sanctions prompted a furious response from Beijing’s embassy in Washington, which said that the US was using “the excuse of human rights” to interfere in the China’s internal affairs.In a string of tweets the embassy said the move “seriously violates the basic norms governing international relations, interferes in China’s internal affairs and undermines China’s interests”.The embassy said: “The counter-terrorism and de-radicalization measures in Xinjiang are aimed to eradicate the breeding soil of extremism and terrorism. They are in line with Chinese laws and international practices, and are supported by all 25 million people of various ethnic groups in Xinjiang.”Inside the administration, the sanctions mark a victory for Pompeo, Vice-President Mike Pence, the administration’s ambassador at large for international religious freedom, Sam Brownback, and the new deputy national security adviser, Matthew Pottinger, over the treasury secretary, Stephen Mnuchin.Mnuchin reportedly argued against sanctions that would further derail difficult trade talks. News of the sanctions drove stock prices lower on the assumption that it would make a trade deal less likely.Donald Trump himself has sought to avoid direct criticism of the Chinese government for its treatment of the country’s Muslims, as well as its attempts to crush pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, so as to avoid a breakdown in his personal relations with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.At a meeting on religious freedom last month at the start of the UN general assembly, scheduled at the same time as a global climate action summit, Trump gave the keynote speech but did not mention China or the events in Xinjiang, leaving it to Pence, Pompeo and Brownback.The fact that these long-planned measures have been taken may reflect Trump’s awareness of his reliance on the religious wing of the Republican party for his re-election bid next year.The state department announcement did not name the Chinese officials that had been targeted, but officials had previously pointed to the Xinjiang party secretary, Chen Quanguo, a member of the politburo."},{"url":null,"title":"brexit a day in the life of an irish border crossing","story":"Ambrose “Bo” McGurgan is checking the tyres on his six-axle lorry at the Applegreen truck stop near Castlebellingham, Co Louth, south of the Irish Border. It is the only check he will undergo before crossing over into Northern Ireland.From the end of this month all that could change with the UK’s exit from the EU on October 31st, the date British prime minister Boris Johnson wants Brexit to happen.McGurgan fears the return of the dreaded customs checks of more than a quarter century ago. He remembers the hard border when 300 or 400 trucks could be parked up for hours awaiting customs clearance.“It will be going back to square one, like in the 70s. It would be a disaster. You could be sitting all day in Dundalk waiting to get cleared,” he tells The .It is 11am on a Monday and the Armagh man has been working for six hours and has already lifted and “tipped” a trailer in Dublin and is heading across the Border for another delivery in Newtownards, Co Down.He is hauling a mixed load of food and industrial goods – sauces and engineering bolts – but requires no paperwork as he drives, unhindered, across an open border between two jurisdictions currently within the EU. A return to the border of the past, that McGurgan waited hours to cross. is very real again.Johnson’s government proposed to the EU last week to replace the contentious backstop guarantee to avoid a hard Irish border with a plan to impose a new customs border on the island of Ireland.The deluge of paperwork, the queues of lorries, the hours-long delays, the potential targeting of customs officers by people upset with the return of a visible border “would be a disaster,” says McGurgan.“People don’t realise how bad it is going to be. We, the older generation, we have done it all. We know how bad it is. There will be customs men shot. There will be. Everybody is fighting for a loaf,” he said.McGurgan’s truck was one of 6,639 goods vehicles to cross the Border on the A1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast last Monday. This is the busiest crossing on the Border between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Traffic counters operated by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the agency monitoring the State’s roads, show that on average five goods vehicles crossed this point of the Border every minute on Monday.This is where the impact of the UK leaving without a deal has the potential to cause the most complications.Next to McGurgan’s truck is fellow haulier Brendan McParland, also a veteran Border-crosser. He is heading to Dungannon, Co Tyrone, with a load of peat after dropping plasterboard in Athy, Co Kildare.He usually hauls European steel, landed at Warrenpoint in Co Down, across the Border to Dublin, Kilkenny or Carlow. Normally he can complete two return runs to Dublin in one day from Warrenpoint.“If the Border was to come, you couldn’t guarantee you would even get one load done,” he said, munching on a sandwich in the cab of his lorry.Michael Harbinson is one of several lorry drivers stopped at Applegreen transporting Coca-Cola products from its manufacturing facility in Knockmore Hill outside Belfast to customers in the Republic.He believes an all-island economic unit is the way to avoid a hard Border. Not everyone wants this when it comes to both customs and EU single market rules north and south. The DUP also wants Northern Ireland to be able to vote to opt in to an all-island zone covering EU single market rules for goods every four years.“If the North takes a deal still tied with the South, it is the best of both worlds. It is the DUP who is ruining it. They just stand firm in their stance,” said Harbinson.At the last junction before the southern M1-N1 crosses the Border and turns into the northern A1 there is a fuel service station. It lies between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.Colin Byrne, one of the pump attendants of the junction 20 service station, has no clue how the UK and EU would manage this Border if Britain leaves without a deal.“That’s the six million dollar question. Sure how many back roads are there across the Border. It is not doable, simply not doable,” he said.Johnson has ruled out customs checks at or near the Border but has not specified in his plan where “designated locations” for some required checks might be. Byrne offers a foretaste of how checks might work: “every once in a while,” he says, the Garda and customs check vehicles at the southbound exit 18 off the M1 into Dundalk. “If you saw the mayhem that that causes,” he said.On the bridge over the A1 dual-carriageway next to the Carrickdale Hotel there is a constant drone of noise as an “artic” or smaller “rigid” lorry or a light goods vehicle is always coming or going.This is the north-south White Van Man highway.Between 5am and 7pm last Monday – the busiest period of the day – 5,722 goods vehicles cross the Border. That is one goods vehicle every eight seconds. This traffic is split 50:50 in either direction.“It shows trade is equally balanced going in either direction,” said Séamus Leheny, policy manager of the Freight Transport Association, speaking loudly to be heard over the hum of traffic on the bridge.“It is the artery of trade on the island of Ireland. It connects the two largest cities and to have any type of barrier on this, or ersions, or checks, it would inhabit trade and growth economically on either side of the Border here.”Interrupting the flow of traffic here would have a huge impact, he says lorries would “soon stack up” and could be waiting hours if they had to have paperwork inspected or their load physically inspected.The stakes on finding a fix to the Brexit-Border conundrum are high. Leheny explains that five times as much freight crosses the Irish Border than moves between Northern Ireland and Britain, the North’s biggest market, but it is lower in value because it is mostly ingredients and components, and not completed products.“What we make in Northern Ireland, it is comprised of bits and pieces sourced from every corner of the island of Ireland. If we have a hard border, the existence of those products that we make in Northern Ireland are jeopardised because you would have delays, tariffs and the sanitary controls as well,” he said.In the retail game, this Border crossing is an essential supply chain route for multinationals. Northern Ireland supermarkets are stocked from distribution centres in the Republic, and vice versa. Then there are the food products made with ingredients coming from both north and south of the Border.Aodhán Michael Connolly, director of Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, says that a supermarket chicken salad sandwich can have ingredients involving six border movements (north-south and east-west, between the North and Britain), while “the humble cottage pie” can have eight, including a cheese topping produced and processed on different sides of the Border. Each movement involves tariffs so the overall costs could be huge.“That border crossing isn’t just to move goods A to B. It is a lifeline to the supply chain and to those small and medium-sized enterprises right down to the farmers who are in our supply chain,” he said. “If there isn’t frictionless movement across that border, each of those costs will have to go down the supply chain and it is going to make things tougher for the Northern Ireland consumer.”Connolly sees Johnson’s plan as “unworkable” if it is the final deal because a customs border would amount to a hard border, but it is “progress” to open negotiations because it includes an all-island zone for goods.Driving one of his nine trucks across the Border on the A1, Declan Trainor, a cattle and goods haulier, believes the island of Ireland should be “treated as a whole and as one island”.He has no idea how the Border, just a few hundred metres from his office at Carrickcarnan, will look on November 1st, or how he will be able to continue transporting tiles from mainland Europe to Northern Ireland.“It is the unknown. That is the scary part. The Government hasn’t really said how to prepare for it. They are only guessing themselves now so how are you supposed to prepare?” he said. “You don’t know whether it is a dance you are going to or a war. Sure how do you dress for it?”Speaking a few days later, Trainor says Johnson’s “two borders for four years” proposal has left him even more confused. It has also made people who rely on free trade and free movement of goods across the Border “desperate,” he said.“Whatever concern we had, we are more concerned now,” he said.How busy is the M1A1\u0026nbspcrossing?The Border crossing on the M1 motorwayA1 dual-carriageway between Dublin and Belfast is the busiest thoroughfare along the 499-kilometre open frontier between the Republic and Northern Ireland.The four-lane crossing between Newry and Dundalk is about five times busier than the next busiest crossing over the Blackwater river between Emyvale, Co Monaghan, and Aughnacloy, Co Tyrone, based on traffic figures counted daily by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, the State agency that manages the Irish road network.The agency uses a system of counters under the surface of strategically important roads across the country that can differentiate vehicles by wheel axle lengths. This allows the agency to gather data and analyse the volume of traffic and type of vehicles passing on the road for every hour of every day.The counter at Junction 20 on the A1 at Ravensdale between Jonesborough, Co Armagh, and Carrickcarnan, Co Louth, showed that Monday, September 30th – a month before the UK’s scheduled exit from the EU – was a typically busy day for traffic for this major transport route on the island of Ireland.Some 25,301 vehicles crossed the Border over the 24-hour period: 18,175 cars, 6,639 goods vehicles (including the heaviest articulated lorries), 318 buses and 24 motorbikes. That means 17 vehicles crossed the Border on average every minute last Monday. One goods vehicle crossed the Border every 12 seconds.Hauliers, traders and businesses along the Border say any kind of delays stopping traffic on this corridor after Brexit would quickly result in heavy congestion and tailbacks.The busiest times of day are during the morning rush-hour between 8am and 9am, when traffic volumes peaked at 1,935 vehicles, and the late afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm at 1,897 vehicles.The bulk of the traffic crosses the Border between the hours of 7am and 7pm when 19,625 vehicles were counted last Monday, or on average of 1,635 an hour.The traffic is evenly split between northbound and southbound vehicles. However, more than twice as many goods vehicles head southbound between 5am and 9am – making deliveries to the Republic or transporting goods to Dublin Port in time to make the 8am ferry departures to England out of Dublin Port.This route is a critical artery for goods travelling from Northern Ireland south into the Republic. Some 3,425 goods vehicles crossed the Border heading south into the Republic last Monday.This worked out an average of 143 per hour. In other words, one goods vehicle crossed the Border into the Republic on the main Dublin-Belfast road every 25 seconds last Monday.To put this in a national context, this part of the A1 is almost as busy or busier every day than the main Dublin to Galway M4 road at Kinnegad (26,400 vehicles on average a day), the main Dublin to Cork M7 road at Portlaoise (25,700 vehicles) and than the main Dublin to Wexford M11 road at Arklow (22,800 vehicles).Cross-Border workersTen minutes drive south of the Border, dozens of parked cars – nearly all Northern Irish-registered vehicles – line either side of the road off Junction 17 of the M1 near Dundalk in Co Louth.They belong to Northern Irish tradesmen, mostly from across the Border in south Armagh, who park and car-pool into the Republic for work. They are mostly construction works, plumbers and electricians.“There are thousands of people going to and from work every day, crossing the Border every couple of minutes. There are thousands and thousands of guys down south working and Dublin is most of where the work is,” said Neil Byrne, a plumber from Mullaghbane near Forkhill.The Armagh man usually arrives at around 5.50am to park his car and catch his lift to Dublin. He has worked “all over the south” including in Kildare and Athlone.Byrne says he and his fellow commuters to the Republic are concerned about a crash-out Brexit and the return of a hard border resulting in hours and hours of traffic delays crossing the Border.He doesn’t believe a hard border would work it does not make sense to have one, he says. “It is one small country in my opinion: it doesn’t matter whether you are north or south, Ireland is Ireland and you have to get to your work regardless,” he said.Delays and traffic jams are not his only worry.“If there’s a Border, it has the whole issue of the Troubles starting again because in my own personal opinion it is going to happen the exact same way it did back then: customs guys get attacked, then there is a police presence, then they get attacked and then there is a military presence,” he said. “It doesn’t take much to set it off.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsBudget 2020 has broken the assumption built up over recent years of continuous, generous increases in funding for Government departments of across-the-board welfare rises and tax cuts. Each of the four budgets before Tuesday included significant welfare rises and tax cuts, with increases of €5 in weekly welfare rates as demanded by Fianna Fáil’s Willie O’Dea met in all three confidence and supply budgets agreed between his party and Fine Gael. Until yesterday, that is. O’Dea’s request typified the steady pattern of budgets in recent years. Relatively modest measures incrementally moved policy forward each year – and almost came to be taken as a given.The fact that the prospect no increases this year – even against a backdrop of the potential economic shock of a no-deal Brexit – attracted attention in the weeks before the budget underlined just how much such measures were being taken for granted. Insiders say the Government system got used to year-on-year increases. The Department of Health came to casually assume any spending overrun would be covered, mostly through higher than expected corporation tax receipts. An overrun occurred again in 2019, but Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has repeatedly said the €315 million supplementary estimate is roughly half of what was required to plug the gap in health spending last year. He has promised improvements will be made again next year, although others expect the health service will need a bailout once again.According to sources, Ministers and their officials took time to realise that Donohoe was serious about tightening expenditure this year. Speaking privately over the past few weeks, Ministers confirmed that Donohoe was tougher this time out, and was squeezing harder than before. Conscious too of the risks of the economy overheating if there is an orderly Brexit, the departments of finance and public expenditure were unlikely to pass up on the opportunity to restrain spending increases as best they could.CrisisA crisis – or a potential crisis – in the shape of a no-deal Brexit would not be wasted, particularly when Donohoe wanted to rebuild his reputation for prudence, which had been damaged by overspending on the national children’s hospital and national broadband plan.For those inside Government, the recent budgetary patterns, if left unchecked, showed just how “quickly we could lose the run of ourselves again”. And, despite Fine Gael’s public goading of Fianna Fáil as “reckless”, a solid understanding has built between the two parties over these past four budgets.Government figures describe Fianna Fáil as “responsible” and believe a grand coalition is the most desirable outcome of the next election. Fianna Fáilers dismiss such talk, but readily compliment Donohoe as a straight operator.Frustration, according to sources, only really crept in when some Independents engaged in public grandstanding in the days leading up to the budget.Or, as one source characterised demands from Shane Ross, Finian McGrath, Kevin “Boxer” Moran and John Halligan: “The f**king Independent Alliance coming in on a Sunday and making a merry dance.”Despite the relative modesty of the measures unveiled by Donohoe on Tuesday, a budget-day package of €3 billion is certainly not an austerity budget. Yet it may serve as important corrective to what was becoming a well-established pattern.The question that will remain unanswered until next year is whether Budget 2020 caused lasting disruption, or was only a pause before normal service resumed.

Video: Oireachtas TV \t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe’s budget speech is broadcast on multiple televisions at Harvey Norman Airside Retail Park. Photograph: Alan BetsonMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe has delivered a “Brexit budget” amid criticism of the Government over its measures to tackle climate change and the housing crisis.Mr Donohoe said Brexit was the “most pressing and immediate risk to our economy” and announced a €1.2 billion package to tackle the “increasing likelihood” of a no-deal Brexit.The Minister told the Dáil:“I am making approximately €200 million in Brexit expenditure available next year.“It will be borrowed money. If we do not need it, we will not borrow it. If no deal does not happen, it will not be borrowed for other purposes.”He said: “€650 million will be made available to support agriculture and tourism and those most affected regions. Of this, €220 million will be deployed immediately in the event of a no deal.“Make no mistake, no deal will be challenging. But it is a challenge Ireland has the measure of.”The €2.9 billion net budget package includes a €6 per tonne increase in carbon tax and a €1.1 billion allocation to build more than 11,000 new social homes next year. There are no changes to income tax or Universal Social Charge bands but the self-employed tax credit will increase by €150 to €1,500.Free GP care will be extended to children under eight and dental care for children under six from September.Prof John FitzGerald, chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council, said the carbon tax rise to €26 per tonne was disappointing as the council had called for a €15 per tonne increase. The increase will apply on petrol and diesel from midnight but will not apply to home fuels until May 2020. It is likely to add 2 cent to a litre of diesel and 1.7 cent on petrol. Mr Donohoe said this would raise €90 million next year which would be ringfenced for measures to combat the “defining challenge of our generation”.To help with an increase in the carbon tax, the fuel allowance paid to those on social welfare will rise by €2 a week. It is paid for 28 weeks from the beginning of October each year to 370,000 households.However, Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said “it was a status quo budget from a status quo government.“When it comes to really tackling climate breakdown it is the measures other than carbon tax that are crucial, and this budget gives us very little.”The Irish Council for Social Housing described the budget as “deaf” to the demand for investment in “public housing”.There is an additional €20 million allocated for homeless services but the Peter McVerry Trust said it was unfortunate this was split across emergency accommodation and prevention measures as well as day services.An additional €80 million will go to the Housing Assistance Payment scheme, while the Help-to-Buy scheme for first-time buyers will be extended for another two years without any change to its structure.Tánaiste Simon Coveney described the budget as a “Brexit budget” that would be used “to protect Ireland from the worst effects” of a no-deal exit. He said he hoped that the €1 billion-plus would not be needed as he still believed “a Brexit deal is possible”.Funding has also been announced in Tuesday’s Budget for the recruitment of 700 extra gardaí, as well as 1,000 special needs assistants, more than 100 special education teachers and 250 special class teachers in the education sector.A total of 1,000 new frontline staff in the health sector – such as speech and language, occupational and disability therapists – will also be hired.An additional one million home-help hours will be provided for.Excise duty on cigarettes will increase by 50c, raising the price of a pack of 20 to €13.50. There has been no increase in the price of alcohol.Sinn Féin finance spokesman Pearse Doherty criticised the budget as “lacking hope”. “This budget could and should have given workers and families a break. It hasn’t.”Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin told RTÉ: “The poorest cohort of people will be worse off as a result of this budget. That’s simply unacceptable.”The Irish Farmers’ Association president Joe Healy said the funding provided for the agri-food sector will fall short of what will be needed as Ireland faces “an agricultural Armageddon”.“While the €110 million committed to the Department of Agriculture for next year is a step forward, much more will be needed now as farmers are already suffering huge losses due to Brexit uncertainty.”A new “just transition fund” will be allocated €6 million to help those communities. He said a “transition commissioner” would be appointed shortly.The 1 per cent diesel surcharge introduced last year will be replaced with a nitrogen oxide emissions-based charge. This surcharge will apply to all passenger cars registering for the first time in the State from January 1st, 2020.The rate of stamp duty applicable to non-residential property transactions will increase by 1.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent from midnight, in a move that Mr Donohoe says will bring in almost €140 million.It is the second time in three budgets the Minister has increased the rate of commercial stamp duty, having brought it from 2 per cent to 6 per cent two years ago.The National Treatment Purchase Fund will get an additional €25 million next year to tackle hospital waiting lists, bringing its budget to €100 million.Prescription charges will fall by 50c and the drug payment scheme will see its threshold reduced by €10.There will also be a €5 increase in the living-alone allowance from next March, as well as increases in dependent children allowances.How will it affect you and your finances?

Photograph: Derek ScallyThere was a full house at Warsaw’s Rejs cinema, where communist officials once viewed films before deciding on a wider release.They might have struggled with The Queen of Ireland – the 2015 documentary about Rory O’Neill, his drag alter-ego Panti Bliss and Ireland’s marriage equality referendum.The screening, with O’Neill in attendance, was organised last month by the Irish embassy as part of a human rights conference and comes at a charged time.When 31 million Poles are called to choose a new government on Sunday, they are expected to re-elect the national conservative Law and Justice (PiS) for a second term with an absolute majority.Its winning pitch to voters combines left-wing economics, arch-conservative social policies and what critics dub authoritarian ambitions: turning state broadcaster TVP into a government propaganda outfit and packing the judicial system with political loyalists.Last time around, PiS won the election warning of a threat to Polish society from immigration. This time the threat to Poland is the “plague” of so-called “LGBT ideology”.This catch-all term can mean everything from gender politics to marriage equality or a broader definition of family.Jaroslaw Kaczynski, co-founder and chairman of PiS and Poland’s de-facto leader, has termed so-called LGBT ideology a “threat to Polish identity, to our nation, to its existence and thus to the Polish state”.“We need to stand against this massive storm of evil,” he said.\u0026nbspTake-no-prisoners rhetoricFor PiS, its robust, take-no-prisoners rhetoric of nationalist pride and scapegoats has been a vote-bringer.While many Poles admit not knowing what LGBT stands for, others have embraced the campaign as a dog whistle to vent their violent homophobia.Pride parades around Poland this summer were often angry, violent confrontations between LGBT marchers and extreme nationalists.On September 28th, the same day Archbishop Jedraszewski warned in Krakow that so-called LGBT was “clearly an offence to God the creator”, police in Lublin arrested a local couple at the city’s Pride parade. They were carrying a rucksack containing a home-made bomb of gas canisters and fireworks. If convicted, the couple face up to eight years in prison.Lublin native Bartosz Staszewski helped to organise the city’s first pride parade last year. Since then he has sued politicians for equating homosexuals with paedophiles and secured an injunction against a magazine distributing “LGBT-free zone” stickers to its readers.In recent weeks he passed on detailed threats to police, including one of a man promising to drive a vehicle into the marchers. Staszewski, however, did not know of the improvised bomb episode until after the march.\u0026nbsp“I would feel terribly guilty if someone had been hurt and I am horrified at the level of hate we are experiencing,” he said. “Politicians who create this environment of homophobic violence will have blood on their hands when someone gets hurt.”Critics say PiS politics have created a toxic atmosphere which triggers unstable people to do terrible things.In January, a mentally ill man in Gdansk fatally stabbed mayor Pawel Adamowicz, whom PiS and government-loyal media had described variously as a Nazi, a communist and “anti-Polish”.On a rainy Tuesday afternoon, LGBT groups protested outside the Polish Bishops’ Conference at what they see as a co-ordinated church-state campaign against their community.Protesters held up rainbow flags and signs reading “Jail those who protect paedophiles”, seeing no coincidence in how bishops threw their weight behind the PiS campaign this year as revelations were building of clerical sex abuse and church cover-up.One speaker told protesters that, hours earlier, Poland’s court of appeal had ordered the Catholic Church to pay 400,000 zloty (€92,000) in damages to a man abused by a priest.State-sponsored homophobiaMisha Cherniak of the Faith and Rainbow Foundation said he had moved to Poland from Russia nine years ago and was depressed to see the rise here of familiar state-sponsored homophobia.“The church here is playing the same little games with the state but, in such games, the church always loses,” he said. “The church should defend people who have no one to defend them.”\u0026nbspWarsaw city councillor Agata Diduszko, also at the protest, described the campaign against so-called LGBT ideology as a “cynical exercise”.“PiS needs scapegoats to win elections, the church needs PiS to win to preserve their privileges,” she said. “Neither care about the damaging effects of this campaign.”Reflecting on his Warsaw visit, Rory O’Neill says Poland is a “terrifying example of a country slipping backwards”.“They are an EU country that signed up to everything, including on human rights,” he told The . “You could get depressed, but I see young people who are really brave and determined to put themselves on the line. I find that that quite inspiring. They deserve our support.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4045004.1570608259!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit a no deal election is on the cards","story":"Tuesday was another dramatic day in the three-year long Brexit process, as Downing Street sources briefed against Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and German chancellor Angela Merkel and predicted the end of the negotiations road.Predictably, another day of dramatic front pages has followed.’s lead is “Day the deal was doomed” with No 10 sources suggesting that “talks are in tatters”.“Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan appeared all but dead last night as the government admitted there was little prospect of a deal before 31 October after a day of furious recriminations,” it reports.Its editorial, “A no-deal election is on the cards”, reads: “It will be hard to row back from here, as evidence mounts that a breakdown in negotiations is something Mr Johnson and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, are ready to actively seek, as long as they can pin it on the perfidy of the EU.”The Daily  is similarly pessimistic about prospects of an agreement – “Brexit deal now ‘essentially impossible’” – but lays the blame squarely at the feet of the EU, saying “Merkel’s insistence that Northern Ireland must stay aligned with EU is the death knell”, as Johnson allies “accused Angela Merkel of making a Brexit deal ‘essentially impossible’”.The i reports: “Brexit deal ‘impossible’ as EU leaders reject PM’s proposals”. The paper says Johnson has been accused “of playing ‘stupid blame game’,” while quoting UK officials who “insist Brussels has hardened its position as times runs out”.The FT focuses on the relationship between the British prime minister and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, saying: “Johnson urges Varadkar to keep talking as Brexit deal hopes fade”. The paper reports that “Boris Johnson has urged Leo Varadkar to keep faith with talks on a possible Brexit deal, despite Downing Street fears that the prospects for an agreement before October 31 are all but dead”.The ’s front cover has a picture of the prime minister facing off against the German chancellor with the headline “We’re going around in Merkels”. The paper says that the “hope of a Brexit deal is more distant than ever”, with No 10 accusing Germany of “making impossible demands”, while the EU tells the UK to stop with its “‘stupid blame game’”.The Express reports “Brexit talks face collapse after Boris has bad-tempered phone call with German leader, blasting EU for making ‘impossible’ demands on Britain”.“That’s it then! PM’s angry clash spells end of deal,” is the paper’s headline.The Times is more hopeful, however, saying “Johnson gets last chance to keep Brexit deal alive”. The paper reports that a “vital meeting” between the PM and Irish leader Leo Varadkar could take place on Thursday, but does recognise Tuesday was not a good day for Johnson, saying he was “fighting to salvage his Brexit deal after an explosive row with Angela Merkel put talks on the brink of collapse”.The Mirror suggests Boris Johnson is to blame for breakdown in talks and has been “accused of sabotage”. The paper reports that the prime minister’s Brexit plan is now “on the verge of collapse” and that Donald Tusk had “taunted” Johnson, saying: “You don’t want a deal”.SunThe Sun has a small story on Johnson’s Brexit woes, under the headline: “Boris in last-gasp Brex talk with Irish”. But it’s main story is “Cha cha chaps”, about the ITV decision to feature a male couple on the new series of Dancing on Ice, a move the paper says will “make telly history”.MailThe Mail shifts its focus from Brexit and leads on what it has labelled the “dementia care scandal”, as 356,000 signed a petition urging Johnson to “fix a broken system that forces countless pensioners to sell their homes to fund crippling care costs”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

That\u0027s what we\u0027re looking to do.”He said successes in the 12 trial areas could be quickly rolled out to other branches.MPs probe effect of rising bank branch closures on vulnerable peopleBank branch closures reach ‘alarming’ rate of 60 per monthBonfire of the bank branches as HSBC shuts 27 per centEx-Barclays boss Antony Jenkins says bank branches will be blitzedMr Rowse continued: “We believe in the future that branches will be a lot more about education - about helping people with those things that are the most important in their life - whether it\u0027s: \u0027I\u0027m opening my first account\u0027 or: \u0027I\u0027m going off to university\u0027... or: \u0027I\u0027m starting a business\u0027...“We\u0027re really working with the local community to find out what it is that they want.”Barclays said “pop-up” banking facilities to help communities will also appear at 300 locations by the end of 2021.Bank branch and ATM closures generally have sparked fears about people\u0027s ability to continue to access cash.The Post Office, which has around 11,500 branches, offers banking services on behalf of many banks, but some commentators in the access-to-cash debate have argued that this should not be seen as a direct replacement for banks\u0027 own branches.Some other banks and building societies have also recently announced initiatives to boost access to cash or keep branches open.In March, Nationwide Building Society pledged that every town and city with a branch will still have one in May 2021.In February, Lloyds Banking Group, in partnership with Visa, announced a pilot scheme to boost the number of retailers offering cashback.Here are the 12 pilot areas where Barclays is looking at how customer demand in branches could be increased:Yarm, Pickering and Guiseley in Yorkshire, Barnard Castle in County Durham, Wombourne and Kidsgrove in Staffordshire, Risca and Tredegar in South Wales, Shenfield and Burnham-on-Crouch in Essex, Esher in Surrey and Biggin Hill in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That followed three quarters of falling or stagnant productivity, boding ill for wage growth, which tends to track increases in productivity.On the more volatile quarter-on-quarter measure, productivity fell 0.2 per cent in the April-June period.Britain’s workforce now produces less per hour than at any point in the last two years.“Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it’s the only way to increase pay packets in the long term,” said Jon Boys, labour market economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the professional body for HR specialists.“There is an obvious culprit and that’s uncertainty.

In a paper published in August, the bank estimated that over the past three years, the drawn-out process of leaving the EU has reduced UK productivity by between 2 and 5 per cent.According to the central bank, one of the ways in which Brexit uncertainty has dented productivity is by discouraging investment in better equipment and software – spending that improves efficiency in the long run.Instead, as a growing number of economists argue, businesses have preferred to hire more people because they can let them go if their revenues fall.It is this strong but potentially temporary demand for workers, rather than improving productivity, that has boosted wages in recent months, according to Mr Boys at the CIPD. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We mustn’t be fooled by recent strong earnings-growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers’ ability to pay,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The core UK banking system demonstrated its resilience to – and capacity to keep lending in – that stress scenario.Quiet trading of the pound in currency markets today, with no big new developments on Brexit this morning, so far at least.\u0026nbspSterling is basically flat against the euro at €1.116 and up 0.24 per cent against the dollar, $1.225.\u0027A much-loved brand employing talented people\u0027\u0026nbspJohn and Irene Hays, managing director and group chair of Hays Travel, have commented on their purchase of Thomas Cook\u0027s entire UK estate:Thomas Cook was a much-loved brand employing talented people.

It provides re-employment opportunities for a significant number of former Thomas Cook employees, and secures the future of retail sites up and down the UK high street. \u0026nbspWe are pleased to have achieved this in a short time frame and in the context of a complex liquidation process, which is testament to a lot of hard work from a number of parties.\u0026nbspOver the weeks ahead, we will work closely with Hays Travel and landlords to ensure a smooth transition of the store estate.Twitter \u0027mistakenly\u0027 used personal details to customise adverts\u0026nbspTwitter has claimed it mistakenly misused phone numbers and emails provided by users for security purposes to target adverts at them.\u0026nbspIn the latest example of tech companies misusing people\u0027s data to make a profit, Twitter said security details\u0026nbspmay have inadvertently been used for advertising purposes.\u0026nbspUsers provide their details for additional security and protection such as two-factor authentication.

Right here, right now is where we draw the line,” she said. “The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 67Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  This quote, naturally, makes an appearance in the remix, along with other quotes.“People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction, and all you can talk about is money,” a partial quote, also features, as does: “You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you.”“Right Here, Right Now” was released two decades ago, in 1999. It is considered one of the best dance tracks of all time.Thunberg is scheduled to appear at a climate change forum in North Dakota on Tuesday.She has lent her support to the Extinction Rebellion movement, which is continuing protests on Tuesday in London and other parts of the world.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She added: “It’s very likely that it just made a navigational error.”The humpback is believed to have been first spotted on Saturday in Gravesend, near to the location\u0026nbspwhere a beluga whale was first spotted in London last year. The beluga – later dubbed Benny – spent months swimming in the Thames before leaving the capital early this year.Shipping operators have been warned of the presence of the humpback, which\u0026nbspPLA\u0026nbspspokesman Martin\u0026nbspGarside\u0026nbspsaid was thought to be between 5m and\u0026nbsp10m\u0026nbspin length.He told\u0026nbspThe Independent: “We hope it swims out on the next tide but it has been with us for at least two days now.”Why is there an Arctic beluga whale swimming in the Thames?Mr Garside said about one whale a year made its way into the Thames, although it is the first time a humpback has been spotted in the river in London for a decade.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They are sighted only sporadically in the UK, usually off the coast of Scotland.In 2006, a northern bottlenose whale was spotted in the Thames in central London.The whale, which was too weak to find its way back out of the river on its own, died despite\u0026nbsprescuers’ attempts to transport it back to sea.In 2009,\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsphumpback\u0026nbspwhale was found washed up on the shore of the Thames in Kent having seemingly died from starvation.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That followed three quarters of falling or stagnant productivity, boding ill for wage growth, which tends to track increases in productivity.On the more volatile quarter-on-quarter measure, productivity fell 0.2 per cent in the April-June period.Britain’s workforce now produces less per hour than at any point in the last two years.“Businesses may have more immediate concerns than raising productivity, but it’s the only way to increase pay packets in the long term,” said Jon Boys, labour market economist at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), the professional body for HR specialists.“There is an obvious culprit and that’s uncertainty.

In a paper published in August, the bank estimated that over the past three years, the drawn-out process of leaving the EU has reduced UK productivity by between 2 and 5 per cent.According to the central bank, one of the ways in which Brexit uncertainty has dented productivity is by discouraging investment in better equipment and software – spending that improves efficiency in the long run.Instead, as a growing number of economists argue, businesses have preferred to hire more people because they can let them go if their revenues fall.It is this strong but potentially temporary demand for workers, rather than improving productivity, that has boosted wages in recent months, according to Mr Boys at the CIPD. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“We mustn’t be fooled by recent strong earnings-growth figures, which have been driven by a tight labour market and not an increase in employers’ ability to pay,” he said.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only six balls remain to be played with Britain’s star batsman standing at the crease — Boris Johnson.England’s World Cup triumph was achieved against the odds and so the passage of our nation towards Brexit has been a slog.However, the PM, unflappable and unflinching in the face of sledging from all sides, has been transformative in reshaping our fortunes.Now he stands before us with something the doubters, despoilers and delayers thought he could never achieve — a workable proposal that both delivers on the referendum and takes into account the legitimate concerns on the Irish border.Under Boris’s deal the UK would leave the EU’s customs union and the single market.It would restore the supremacy of British law over EU law and free the country from the intrusion of the meddling European Court of Justice.It would allow free trade deals to be agreed with friends and partners across the world, reinvigorating global relationships with allies old and new.It would end the payment of vast sums of hard-earned taxpayers’ money and deliver the Brexit that the British people were promised.MPs across Parliament are already starting to show that they are prepared to put partisan dferences to one side to unite behind the deal.Now it is time for the rest of the EU to do the same, to put an end to the toing and froing, the talks and the emergency summits, the snail filled — and snail-paced — diplomatic dinners and take the path out of this cul-de-sac which has now been cleared for them by Boris Johnson.We stand on the brink of an historic month, where all sides have the chance to prove they can put statecraft above squabbling, consensus above conflict, and diplomacy above ision. With Boris at the helm and calm heads all round, success is at our fingertips. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And hoping to hell she doesn’t suddenly draw Will Carling in that sandpit of hers.Which, mercully, she didn’t. There was just a hospice, a candle and two little heads who were probably William and Harry, but could just as easily have been Wayne Sleep and Simon Le Bon.It passed without major diplomatic incident, though. As did the rest of Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions’ final, where viewers were served up everything from Stavros Flatley and the Ukrainian sandpit woman to Twist And Pulse and the astonishing -year-old German dog dancing girl, Alex Lauenburger, who’s got those mutts of hers drilled like . . . like . . .Well, never mind what she’s got them drilled like. Let’s just say they’ve cocked their little legs all over Pudsey the dog’s grave. There were a couple of failures among the success as well, of course: magician Darcy Oake, who dropped his act in favour of a bereavement story, and American comedian Preacher Lawson.Brilliant, charismatic and funny during the semi-final, Preacher was rushed, confused and barely raised a laugh during the final. Not that any of the judges did him the favour of spelling out the truth. They don’t seem to do that on BGT: The Champions. What they get instead is OTT praise and  hope.Absolutely the oddest thing they did, though, during Saturday’s final, just before Cowell teed up daredevil Bello Nock as “certiably insane”, was getting Ant  Dec to introduce Britain Get Talking, an ITV mental wellness campaign sparked, apparently, by a “ per cent rise in anxiety and depression”.To counter that trend, proceedings were halted and replaced by an awkward silence inside Wembley Arena, so that viewers could communicate with their nearest and dearest, as they probably would’ve done during the following ad break anyway.Opinions on this stunt will, I realise, y wildly. Given there’s no shortage of shows dealing with mental health issues, though, it just looked to me like BGT had jumped on board the virtue-signalling bandwagon.It also flew in the face of light entertainment’s real purpose, to lt the human spirit and remove you from le’s harsh realities for a minute or two.The audience understands thisonly too well, and that’s why Saturday’s top two places were filled by acts who offered no sob stories, just entertainment.Twist And Pulse deservedly won and got the BGT trophy. Stavros Flatley came second, so Deme’s we doesn’t even get that new fridge. What happens to BGT: The Champions next  I’ve no idea and suspect ITV doesn’t either.All we do know for sure, in fact, is the next part of this weird Autumn Cowell trilogy is X Factor: Celebrity, a replacement for the civilian version which was, in part, dragged down by endless audience manipulation and accusations of favouritism.“Megastar” acts on this new show will include Max  Harvey. A new one on me but, lo and behold, turns out they’re managed by Simon Cowell’s mate Tim Byrne, who used to be Creative Director of Syco.ON Friday’s EastEnders Jean Slater said: “I can’t believe they’ve been pretending to like my sausage surprise all these years. It makes me wonder what they think of my fishy basket.”THANKS to Wednesday’s Cape Town jaunt on The Apprentice, I now know there are , shipwrecks off the coast of South Africa, rhinos are not to be confused with elephants and hippos enjoy mating. Even at the age of .Just don’t ask me to name safari’s “big five”, ’cos I’ve watched that episode three times now and my best guess is still lion, rhino, elephant, The Gruffalo and Thomas Skinner, the hulking great Charley Boorman lookalike from Romford, whose nose twitches uncontrollably whenever he’s just said something wrong.“Look, we ain’t a bunch of idiots, are we ” .Thomas, of course, was one of the stand-out performers on a brilliant first episode, along with Ryan-Mark Parsons , Carina Lepore, whose tour of the vineyard sculpture park was a bit wordy for my likingand Lottie Lion, who “worked in the best wine bar in the UK”, and is as fragrant and enticing as a broken bottle of Buckfast.It bodes well for the series, but almost certainly won’t stop the usual axe-grinders complaining “The Apprentice is past its sell-by-date”, even though there are other network fixtures and fittings that fit that description so much better.Andyou want a full and exhaustive list of all those BBC shows which deserve to be sent to the knacker’s yard long before Lord Sugar’s masterpiece, here goes.

Not where. When does that all start Paul Merson: “This lad’s come in and not let them down once. Although he let them down at Old Trafford.”RICHARD Madeley has left The Circle and, given the impact he had on the Channel  reality show, it would have been understandableall the interest had gone with him. The fact it hasn’t is largely down to the discovery of a brand new television star.He’s Tim, the show’s -year-old theology professor, who, unlike all the millennials in that building hiding their insecurities behind a wall of tattoos and fake identities, is so comfortable in his own skin he works out in the gym wearing a three- piece, while reading a book.It’s an approach that can trip him up, quite literally, on the running machine. No one, least of all the other contestants, should mistake the most sweet-natured man on telly for a fool, though.He has sussed out almost everyone  on The Circle, including catfish Katie Jay, and knows exactly how they will react to his messages before he’s even sent them.I wouldn’t normally advocate a post-reality show career for any of these fame-chasers.

I’ll stick to @BBCNews thanks.While another added: @Piers_Morgan ranting because ER protesters got something to eat at McDonalds and tries to imitate Greta Thunbergs pleas to the UN....what a moron.Piers has repeatedly taken aim at Greta, and recently blasted the Swedish trailblazer when she was tipped to win the Nobel Peace Price.He tweeted then: What’s she done for peace, exactly  She’s got just very very angry about climate change, abused loads of adults  terried millions of children. Before this mornings attack on Greta, Piers had been slamming Extinction Rebels to co-host Susanna Reid.He stormed: Im glad it rained yesterday because that lot needed a goddamn shower.These people went to McDonalds to eat mass-produced beef out of cardboard boxes... they are shameless hypocrites, going to the epicentre of fast food.We all want to save the planet...

I describe it as being supportive, fat-shaming is being called fat.His le was turned around when gym boss Mike Hind spotted him at his healthy diner and offered to take him under his wing with a free fitness regime.Dibsy, , was consuming , calories a day — an average man needs around , — feasting on sausage sandwiches, pizzas and takeaway kebabs.Mike printed leaflets saying, “Save Dibsy, obesity is killing him. Do not serve this man”, and together the pair handed them out to all his local takeaways and asked the owners not to let him in.At the time, single Dibsy was miserable. He couldn’t get a job and had to wear specially made clothes.Now, he has given up fizzy drinks and booze and swapped takeaways for a calorie-controlled diet and exercise.He is down to , calories a day and is burning , of those with his fitness regime.His gruelling training schedule comprises three gym sessions a day. And it has paid off.Dibsy said last month, after hitting the  stone milestone: “If someone told me last year I would be entering the Great North Run I would have thought they were crackers.“I was at death’s door because of my lestyle. I was a million miles away from doing a half-marathon.“But I have got to the starting line thanks to hard work, determination and the support of an incredible group of people.“Obesity is a major problem in the UK but I am living proof that it can be beaten. If I can do it, then anyone can.”The UK is the third fattest nation in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation, with more than a quarter of the population officially obese.And the North East, where Dibsy lives, is one of the fattest regions in the country.He has struggled with his weight all his le, and the death of his father from cancer when he was  only worsened his comfort-eating.His huge bulk had a devastating effect on his le.He couldn’t get a job, visits to the cinema were out because the seats were too small for him and he had to book two seats whenever he travelled by train or plane.He couldn’t even wear a watch because no strap was big enough for his wrist.Dibsy knew he had to act after a heart scare landed him in hospital last year. A doctor told him he would die unless he changed his lestyle.It was just after that when he visited Mike’s diner with his mum.Married dad-of-three Mike began putting him through his paces at his Mas Body Gym in their home town of Middlesbrough and provided all his meals from his healthy eating diner.Dibsy said: “I am much more confident now. Physically I am in a better state than I have been for years.“Mentally I am the best I’ve ever been in my le.Dibsy has been disciplined with his fitness and diet routine but he did nearly fall off the wagon once.He said: “On a Saturday night a few months ago I was at home and bored.“I was looking through Facebook and everyone seemed to be having a takeaway and a few beers.“I put a message up saying I was struggling and was thinking of having a takeaway myself.“Someone alerted Mike, who was at a family party, and within  minutes he had phoned me and said he was coming round.“We went out for a walk and he talked to me about what we were trying to achieve.“Then he took me to the hospital, where you can get weighed, and he showed me how much weight I had lost.“He said, ‘That’s why we are doing this’. I was so pleased the next day that I hadn’t given in to temptation.“I can’t put in to words how grateful I am to Mike for everything he’s done.”Dibsy has already become a mentor for others. He said: “I get messages every day from people all over the world. It is often a case of, ‘I can’t do it, I have tried and tried and I just can’t lose weight’.“I answer every one of them and tell them I am living proof that it can be done.“The most important thing is to not leave it too late. I used up nearly every one of my nine lives and put my family through hell.“I tell people, ‘don’t do that to your family. Go to the doctor or to the gym, there are people out here who can help you’.“The most important thing is to start as soon as possible.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a shining beacon. Somehow it made everyone, regardless of age or background, feel special.The menu was fresh and new. We had never even seen torn basil or dough balls. The restaurants were in cool locations. There was one above a recording studio in London’s Bloomsbury.When I was in Blur, we lived off those pizzas for years. I’d order two margherita pizzas at a go because they were so cheap.So it is sad to hear the chain, a British staple since , with  restaurants here and in Ireland, is struggling under a mountain of debt.Some p of every £. margherita it sells goes directly to paying off interest. That’s before salaries and rent costs.Social media is mourning its possible demise. Jokers quip that when it folds, it should be renamed Calzone Express.Yet the chain is far from alone. Jamie’s Italian had to close  restaurants this year and , staff lost their jobs. Strada has shut a third of its venues. Prezzo and Carluccio’s have undergone restructuring.Pizza, as a business model, is brilliant. It has the same ingredients as a cheese and tomato sandwich but you can charge £ for it.Yet times have changed. Services such as Deliveroo mean we can have our pick of restaurant food in the comfort of our own homes.Pizza Express is still somewhere wonderfully classless and unfussy. You can just as happily take a date there as a family.Its three-course meal deal for little ones is brilliant and the staff are always wonderful with picky children. My we and five kids love it . . . and so do my girlfriends. It has expanded its menu, with low-calorie options and vegan meals. Yet it still suffered a fall of nearly eight per cent in earnings over the first half of this year.Part of the problem is that until quite recently there were very few places you would really want to eat on the high street.Now we are overwhelmed with choice in the “casual dining” market, with everything from Japanese to Thai to Mexican, plus a lot more pizza options.What’s more, Pizza Express is owned by a Chinese private equity company, Hony Capital, which has greedily expanded the number of venues since it took over the chain in . There are branches everywhere now.That expansion has slowed, with just two new restaurants opening in the first half of the year. It is taking a more measured approach.I always felt the restaurants had a lot of personality and charm, as well as serving great food at affordable prices — all things that were hard to get in the brand’s heyday.Founder Peter Boizot probably never imagined how much the market would change. He fell in love with Italian food while working as a tutor in Florence before going to Cambridge University. Pizza was unusual here then.Movie director Mario Zampi opened a pizzeria called Pizza Express in Soho’s Wardour Street, central London in . But his film-star friends, including Sophia Loren, turned their noses up at such “peasant food”. Boizot was undeterred.He took over Zampi’s restaurant, including its £, of debt, shipped in Britain’s first pizza oven from Naples and sold his first square pizza slices for two shillings a pop on March , .His first chef was a Sicilian aged  who made the dough in the front room of the restaurant, so customers could see it taking shape.That led to the idea of the chain’s open kitchens, which were revolutionary. It was also responsible for introducing Peroni beer to the UK, an Italian classic.While you would usually have to stand in other pizzerias, Boizot brought in tables and proper metal cutlery.As an art collector, he wanted a stylish concept and hired Italian designer Enzo Apicella to work with him across  restaurants.He called his empire a “necklace of inidual gems” rather than a chain.His favourite pizza was a quattro formaggiwith chopped basil and extra green peppers.Boizot sold the business for £million in  and Hony Capital bought it  years later for £million, racking up debts now estimated to be £.billion.The annual interest is £million, wiping out its profits. Experts say the high street favourite is not in immediate danger, as it has until  to start paying back large chunks of this debt.We have seen what happens to similar chains before, though. If we don’t want to lose this one, action must be taken.Sadly, it is hard to see how our high street can survive without government incentives. Business rates are high and parking is often a nightmare.If you care about a business, the best way to support it is with your custom.And I reckon dinner out with the family is probably better value now, and tastier too, than ever before.

And instead you loudly announce to Parliament that you are not.

The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster announced: We in this government have compromised!We in this government are showing flexibility! “We in this government seek to leave without a deal!    He was of course supposed to say with a deal. He added: But faced with the delaying, disruptive and denying tactics of the opposition, we say on behalf of the .million - enough enough enough, we need to leave. The timing was unfortunate for Mr Gove, as it came amid a furious row in which the EU has accused Boris Johnson of not really wanting a Brexit deal at all. European Council President Donald Tusk accused the Prime Minister of a stupid blame game as deal talks looked close to collapse with a few days to go. Mr Johnson has just days to agree a Brexit deal with the EU before a summit on October  - and last week unveiled a system for two borders in the region. But the plans have prompted a cool reaction in the EU. And today No sources sent out briefings saying a deal was unlikely and pinning the blame on Brussels.

They werenapost even allowed to leave the airport.    Mum-of-three Kate said she and Ray were treated like criminals and stuck in there for  hours before being forced to fly straight home and miss their dream cruise. Speaking to the ECHO , Kate said: We took two back to back flights to arrive in Beijing and when we got to the desk after waiting in the queue they took our photos and looked at our passports. They told us to go and take a seat. A lady escorted us to the side. We were going to do three days in Beijing and then we were going to board the cruise.    They escorted us to the left and there were a lot of people sitting down and they told us we hadnapost been given entry. There were fellow passengers who were saying we werenapost getting into Beijing. We sat for a few hours with no advice or anything. We called an immigration officer over. His response was that they didnapost have a reason [for refusing us entry to the country] - they donapost have to give us one. We were sat in an airport for  hours. There were quite a few people from Liverpool and we said we will all stay in the airport.  Youaposre allowed to stay in the airport for  hours but we were told that after that we were going to be arrested. Kate said: Panic set in then - everyone started trying to get flights. The panic set in. We tried to go to the next stop where the ship was going to be in Japan. However, shelling out for more flights to try and get to Japan to meet the ship at the next stop would have cost the couple hundreds of pounds - plus the cost of further transfers and accommodation. The couple, who booked their holiday through Iglu Cruises, paid extra for excursions once they were on board the ship - like exploring the tunnels of Vietnam. They also planned a three day holiday in China before the ship set sail, exploring the Great Wall and taking in the Forbidden City.  But despite all their planning and thousands of pounds, the couple didnapost even make it outside the airport and missed their anniversary cruise. They claim they were treated appallingly by airport staff, with Kate telling the ECHO : They were so bloody arrogant. They were smirking - we were treated like criminals. There were wives without their husbands, one guy his son was getting married in Beijing this week and they werenapost letting him in. She added: The security had us up against the wall saying donapost move, passing our passports around and laughing at us. It was an awful experience. When youaposre in a strange country itaposs really scary. They just didnapost like us.  They fear they will also have lost all the money spent on their trip, which was due to start in Beijing and end in Singapore on October  before flying back to Manchester. Kate and Ray were forced to transfer their flight home from Singapore to an immediate flight back to the UK from Beijing with Ethiad Airlines. Ray hit out at Iglu, who he claims have told the couple they will receive no refund for their ordeal. He said: Weaposve had no support from them. We will get no money back as far as theyaposre concerned because itaposs a government decision.

Emma Moffatt and partner Jordan Burns reserved a new-build home in Huyton, near Liverpool, but asked for several things to be changed before they took the keys. The couple said there had been several issues with builders, Bellway, including that the new plot had a coal shaft close to the property, a misspelled name and claims they were overcharged for flooring. They wrote to chief executive Jason Honeyman asking for a gesture of goodwill infor the errors, the Liverpool Echo reports.  But Ms Moffatt, from Lydiate, near Liverpool, said she was shocked days later when she read the response from the regionaposs managing director, telling her nothing in her complaint warranted a goodwill gesture. The email added that because of the complaintaposs nature and how unhappy she seemed to be Bellway was not the builder for her. The company cancelled the coupleaposs reservation - meaning the house at the Willow Grange development was back on the market.  Ms Moffatt said the couple are now extremely upset and angry, telling the ECHO she had a panic attack when she heard the news. Describing the situation as the worst customer experience, Emma said: I was driving and Jordan rang me to inform me of the news. I had a panic attack on the side of the motorway and my parents had to come and get me, I literally cried the whole night as my dream house had just crumbled in front of my eyes. Ms Moffatt said despite the setback, she rang Bellway in an attempt to salvage the deal and spoke to several officials but said she was spoken to rudely.  I hope nobody  has to go through the stress an upset we have been through, she added. In a statement, Bellway - one of the UKaposs largest house builders - said it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment - and that it was incredibly proud of our customer service. Ms Moffatt said the couple were devastated, adding: Mine and my partneraposs dream house, which we have worked so hard for, is gone. We are extremely upset but angry more than anything with how we have been treated. It seems that they thought we are a young couple so let’s bully them out of the house - and this is not ok. Ms Moffatt said the couple had been searching for a property for a year and had visited the Willow Grange development on ious occasions looking for the perfect home. She added: We were looking for a home to start a family in, so after a few months of back and forth, we finally decided on a four-bedroom detached house, so reserved the house. Ms Moffatt said after being shown the plans, they were told there was a mine shaft close to the house - prompting the couple to ask about the risks involved - but said the issue was brushed under the carpet and we still have not received the information.

It was the first time in  years a humpback whale had been spotted in the Thames. The rare species can weigh up to  metric tonnes in adult form.    Martin Garside, from the Port of London Authority, said on Monday: There were a number of sightings by boats on the river during the course of yesterday. We have not had any confirmed sightings today. As far as the reports yesterday go, it is a dark-coloured whale with a small dorsal fin - so it is not anything like the beluga. This animal is darker.    All we know at this stage is it is dark-coloured. There are ying estimates of size, between five metres and  metres. That is consistent in description with a humpback and also other types, including a minke whale. We are working with British Divers Marine Le Rescue, who are monitoring the behaviour of the whale and the type of species. It is not an everyday sight, although we have had a number of whales in the Thames.

Edyta Mordel, , could receive up to £, after suing over the “wrongful birth” of her son, who is now aged four.

All mums-to-be are offered a test for Down’s syndrome between  and  weeks of ­pregnancy. When told by Royal Berkshire Hospital of the diagnosis she was said to be “very upset and angry” because she thought she had received an all-clear.    Campaigners say people with Down’s syndrome can achieve normal le goals. It causes some learning disability that can y, and people may be more likely to have heart, digestive system, hearing and sight problems. Ms Mordel, of Reading, Berks, said in the witness box: “I knew someone from work with Down’s syndrome. I saw how dficult his le is and I would not have continued my pregnancy. “I would not have wanted a disabled child and I would not have wanted my child to suffer the way disabled people suffer.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA young girl spent just five days with her newborn baby sister before tragically dying from a rare condition she had since birth. Darcy Roger, , packed a letime of love into just five days, when Beatrice, the baby sister she had longed for was born two weeks premature. Their heartbroken mum Emily Nixon, , recalled how the desperately sick little girl bonded with her new sibling before suddenly passing away. Brave Darcy had endured  operations during her short le and was awaiting heart surgery when she contracted the infection which killed her on January . She was born with a rare disorder called VACTERL Association which affects dferent systems in the body.    Full-time mum Emily spent five very special days at the local hospice with her daughteraposs body saying her final farewells. She said: “She was the most special person. Darcy was so kind and the memories I have are of her when she was thinking about other people. “We gave her some pocket money and told her she could spend it on anything she wanted and she chose some little slippers for Bea. “I speak about her all the time. There will never be a time when she is not spoken about to Bea. It’s important that she knows all about her sister. “The house is full of pictures and it feels like there is a connection between them. If you put a picture of Darcy in front of Bea, she smiles like she knows who she is.  “Darcy was like an old head on young shoulders, we would go for walks and ask her what she was doing and she would say things like ‘just admiring the view’.”   The most devastating thing is that Darcy did not get to spend enough time with Bea, because that was the thing she was most excited about. They would have been the best of friends.  Emily and her partner-of-five-years, Kristian DaposRosario, , of Malton, North Yorkshire, have launched a clothing brand Love Darcy Clothing in her memory. The family have raised more than £, to raise awareness of the work of Martin House Hospice for Children, in Wetherby, North Yorkshire. Six weeks after she was born, Darcy was diagnosed with VACTERL Association, which is a rare condition when a rare group of symptoms appear together. These symptoms include vertebral defects, anorectal anomalies - affecting the anus and rectum - cardiac defects, trachea-oesphageal fistula, which are rare conditions of the oesophagus and windpipe, renal abnormalities and limb abnormalities.   Although no signs of what was to come were detected during pregnancy, Darcy was born with a missing radial bone in her forearm and thumb, and at six weeks old medics detected a heart murmur.   Living in Kent at the time, Darcy was referred to London’s Royal Brompton Hospital where, after also finding issues with her bowel, doctors diagnosed her with VACTERL Association.     As a result, during her short le, she had  operations altogether, on her limbs and bowel, as well as five lots of open heart surgery, the first to close a hole in her heart and the rest to treat pulmonary stenosis, a narrowing of the heart valve which affects the ing of the heart, requiring surgery to cut away excess tissue.   She also had a colostomy bag until she was three years old. Stepdad Kristian, who adored Darcy and had helped care for her since she was  months old, said:  “We spoke to her like an adult about her condition. We wanted to make sure she was comfortable and understood what was going on.   “She was so calm about it, whenever she was in hospital she knew it was because she needed looking after.   “Even after having open heart surgery, within a few hours she wanted to get up and go to the playroom. That’s what she was like.   “The main problem was that it made her tired, because her heart was working harder than it should have been. She wasn’t allowed to play as much as the other children, which was really hard for her.   “If she overdid it, a few days later she would have no energy.  “But, despite everything, we had been told that she would make it to adulthood. There was never any talk about her not getting to that stage.”   Sadly, during the final quarter of , Darcyaposs health took a turn for the worse. While she was waiting for heart surgery, her parents took her to AE five times in two months, complaining of stomach pains. With her immune system weakened, medics thought she probably had a urine infection or a virus.   But on January , she blacked out while Kristian was getting her ready for school.   Taking her first to the GP, they soon found themselves being taken by ambulance to York Hospital, where her condition was monitored.  Kristian recalled: “She had no energy. We knew she was not well because she didn’t eat much of her dinner, which was her favourite, macaroni cheese, and she offered her ice cream to Emily, which was not like her at all.  “At about am the following day she woke up then sort of blacked out again. I ran to get the nurse and about  people came into the room.   “She had become breathless and was struggling for air. She was essentially having a cardiac arrest.   “The medics tried to resuscitate her and worked on her for about  minutes, but she didn’t make it.”   She was pronounced dead at am that morning, which was the same time Bea had been born in the same hospital five days earlier.   Emily recalled: “Darcy had been sat up talking to me about playing a few hours earlier. Then, in a flash, she was gone. I remember it clearly, I stepped back to let the medics work on her and she was very much aware of what was going on.   “I remember she said, ‘Where’s my mummy ’ She wanted me to be in front of her. The moment she passed away she was looking right into my eyes, like she knew and didn’t want to leave without seeing me.   “She said right beforehand, ‘I want to go home, Mummy.’  Kristian and I have spoken about that moment and whether she meant go home to her house, or that she wanted to go to heaven. We think maybe she had had enough. Sheaposd had that many operations in her short le that maybe it took too much of a toll on her body. “Bea was in the room with us, so we were all with her.   It’s so devastating to think that one moment Darcy was in hospital and we did not think she was as poorly as she was and the next, our lives had been turned upside down.   A post-mortem found Darcy had died of a cardiac arrest, due to an infection that had got into her bloodstream, called a cardiobacterium. It  can be present in the mouth, nose and throat, or heart valves.     “I didn’t want to leave at the end of five days. We got to spend time with her and have photographs taken, including some of her and Bea to show her when she’s older.”   Kristian added: We were able to make artwork from her hands and feet.   “Knowing she was in the same place as us was really comforting.”   Darcy was buried at New Malton cemetery, just down the road from the family home, so they can visit her every day.   The most tragic thing for them is knowing that Bea will grow up not knowing her big sister and that Darcy will never get to have the relationship she was so looking forward to.

Speaking to news.au, general manager Andrew Badcock confessed that some food brands donapost use real jam in their jam doughnuts at all.Instead they fill the tasty treats with coloured and flavoured apple paste or sauce.    He explained: Some food brands use apple paste or sauce as the core ingredient in their raspberry jam recipe. With its natural sweetness and no pips, apple sauce is widely used for its smooth and ‘jammy’ texture. He added: Many customers show a proclivity towards smoother and more consistent textures in their food choices as it’s a more familiar and comforting experience. Pips, seeds and smaller grains tend to get caught in teeth and a lot of people don’t appreciate that sensation.    So there you have it folks, the world as we know it, is in fact a lie.

Youaposve probably never been able to tell the dference between the two, as it looks very similar to the real thing and only tastes slightly dferent, but it takes less time to make and can be purchased in a concentrated form, so it lasts longer.

The liner was meant to stop at France, Amsterdam, Norway and Iceland. Instead the trip turned into a series of calamities that left passengers feeling mutinous. The ship reportedly set off from Southampton on September . First, Amsterdam was cut from the trip, which they were told was because high winds prevented the vessel from docking. It then skipped Le Havre, and carried on to Norway.    The boat then reportedly stopped at a aposdesertedapos Norwegian town that was closed to tourists. Next, they were meant to head to Reykjavik in Iceland. But that stop was cancelled and they continued sailing to an unplanned visit Greenock, near Glasgow. But the cruise ship was denied permission to dock in Greenock on Monday, prompting the captain to change course for Belfast. Passengers had by this point been stuck on the ship for three days. They claimed to have been served stale food in the shipaposs restaurants. Frustrated customers, who reportedly included British, AMerican, and Chinese torists, staged a demonstration in the shipaposs grand atrium, chanting aposshame on youapos, aposget us off this shipapos and aposwe want refundsapos.    Deena Roland, , from Taunton, Devon, told Mail Online : There are a lot of angry people on this ship and the lack of adequate explanation as to what’s going on almost caused a riot this morning. It’s been a nightmare of a holiday, and now many of the toilets in the cabins are overflowing with sewage.

Mikayla Stutchberry, a disability worker from Australia, wanted to emulate all of her friends and get the work done to plump up her lip. But, after her visit to a Laser Clinics Australia Outlet, her lips swelled up and became painful. Doctors say she had lip filler injected into the arteries in the botched procedure - and was incredibly lucky it wasnapost worse. Mikayla told News: And then there was a part where I got blisters and they burst, and I started swallowing the filter and passed out.  You see horror stories on TV, but assume that would never happen to you, until it actually does.  Mikayla claims her doctor told her that her lips were infected, and then she became allergic to the antibiotics she purchased.  This led to her being off work for a fortnight, and losing her job, she said. Professor Mark Ashton, the former President of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, spoke to News and said Mikayla was lucky. Prof Ashton said: In my opinion, there is little doubt that this poor girl has had filler injected into the arteries supplying her upper lip. That filler has then gone on to cause tissue death. It could have gone up into her face, up along the side of the nose and into her eye, and she could have been rendered blind instantaneously.  The clinic denies any wrongdoing.  In a statement, it said: Laser Clinics totally rejects Ms Stutchberyaposs allegations. There is no medical evidence that the Laser Clinics treatment caused any infection. It said the clinic followed all appropriate clinical procedures mandated by Laser Clinics and there is no report or finding to the contrary that has been brought to the attention of Laser Clinics to suggest any error. Meanwhile Cosmetic doctor Daniel Lanzar, who was one of the first dermatologists to bring lip fillers and injections to Australia more than two decades ago, is worried about the widespread emergence of clinics offering the services.Heaposs spoken out about lip-filler treatments that really should be done in a medical room and told News that he never envisaged such services would be offered in clinics operating out of shopping centres."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19402630.jpg ","title":"consistency is key for dee dark blues must build on victory over red lichties","story":"After just  minutes at Dens Park, the tension had already built in the stands with every stray pass causing anxiety among the crowd.With two wins from seven in the league, understandably tensions were high among the support and it would have been easy for these Dundee players to cave under the pressure and go into their shells after taking a point from their last two seemingly-winnable games.But with all credit to them, James McPake’s side rolled their sleeves up and got on with the job at hand knowing anything other than a victory, especially on the back of Dundee United’s defeat on Friday night to Alloa, was not an option.This was a decent performance by the Dark Blues, aided by a fantastic double from Declan McDaid and a masterclass in midfield play by Graham Dorrans.The former Rangers man showed exactly what he can offer on Saturday, demonstrating from the first whistle that he is a player of the very highest class in this league.He controls games, instils confidence in the rest of his team–mates and,Dundee are to have any hopes of catching up with their city rivals Dundee United, Dorrans will be key to that charge.However, in this game, Arbroath again managed to highlight a few of the frailties in this Dundee side during the opening quarter of the game which proved to be a nervy  or so minutes.When Josh Meekings got into a mess which would eventually see David Gold break free for the visitors, it was a heart-in-mouth moment for the home fans.Luckily, Graham Dorrans and then Jordon Forster did enough to put Gold off and avoid what would have been a dreadful start.Indecision at the back continued for Dundee, with Jordan McGhee launching the ball into his own box which caused even more panic in defence. Luckily on this occasion the home side were able to clear.What the game needed was something special, something to get the fans on their feet and eventually McDaid would deliver exactly that.A -yard strike would fly past Derek Gaston, crash off the post and find the back of the net in what proved to be the perfect settler for both players and fans.It was at this point Dundee played some of their best stuff and Dorrans was involved when the Dee almost grabbed their second on the stroke of half time. He took a smart free-kick, finding McGhee in the middle of the box before he laid off to McDaid, his strike crashing off Ricky Little when it looked certain to go in.That’s the thing about this team, the philosophy manager McPake wants to use can cause impatience in the stands but when they get going, it can be easy on the eye.Especially with strong midfield players like Dorrans, Shaun Byrne and Paul McGowan pulling the strings.It was another well-worked set-piece which brought a second for Dundee and for McDaid.He found Sean Mackie on the byline who ed it to his fellow-winger before McDaid cut inside and rled a spectacular strike into the top corner to double his tally and better his previous long-range strike in the first half.Despite an attempted comeback from the visitors following the second goal, it was always comfortable for Dundee after they doubled their tally – and they could have had even morenot for some poor decision making.The real test lies ahead, though, as they look to follow this result up with another victory.Each league win so far has been followed up by two poor results – an average that simply cannot continueDundee are to have any hope this season."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9464d32ed745.15718946-846x564.jpg ","title":"dad always said hed be teaching until his final day and he was tributes paid to much loved broughty ferry driving instructor","story":"A driving instructor who helped four generations of families in Broughty Ferry get behind the wheel has died aged .Bill Anderson, of Strome Terrace, who set up Broughty Ferry School of Motoring in , died on Monday having been admitted to hospital two weeks earlier.Bill had been taken in for bowel surgery but developed bronchitis and pneumonia which he was too weak to fight off.He leaves behind his we Norma, , two daughters Lorraine Kneebone, , and Lezley Cassidy, , and four grandchildren Nick, , Ross, , Jamie, , and Tamzyn, .Lorraine said: “Dad was a friendly gentleman, he had a great sense of humour and got on with everyone.“He loved his business.

win away at high-flying Inverness before a narrow - loss to Queen of the South at the weekend.On a positive note, a repeat performance from Saturday’s brace hero Declan McDaid against his former club could go a long way to sealing the three points.The ex-Ayr winger was excellent for Dundee in the win over Arbroath and one of few good performers against Queen of the South and Morton in recent weeks.While he and other new boys like Jordan Marshall and Shaun Byrne have taken a while to show their best form and others like Jordan McGhee and Graham Dorrans have provided instant class, the Dark Blues could do with a few more new faces finally clicking into gearthey are to kick on from here.Kane Hemmings has struggled for goals since his marquee move back to Dens in the summer, while Josh Todd and Sean Mackie are yet to show their best form.They are no doubt a work in progress but, given where they were at this time last season, Dundee are in decent shape under McPake.The squad, despite operating a level below, is stronger in terms of both quality and depth and fans are even starting to leave Dens with a smile on their faces come Saturday at pm.Dundee only managed one home league win last season so with three under their belt already this season that is a marked improvement.The pressure of winning two on the spin is a monkey on Dundee’s back but one they seem ready to shake off."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5d9da28c136d25.72713004-124x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"man sustained minor injury following bust up at perth road bar","story":"Police have launched an investigation into a bar bust-up that took place in Dundee on Sunday.Officers were alerted to a disturbance at The Braes on Perth Road at .pm on Sunday.One man was found to have sustained a “minor injury” in the incident.Further details of his condition were not provided by police.A spokeswoman for Police Scotland confirmed that a “disturbance” had taken place.However, those involved in the altercation have not been identied and to date the bar has not responded to the Tele’s requests for comment on the incident.The spokeswoman said: “Around .pm on Sunday October , police were called to a report of a disturbance at The Braes Bar on Perth Road, Dundee.“During the incident a male sustained a minor injury.

plenty of hope","story":"Dundee United saw their early form take a hit after a surprise defeat to bottom side Alloa Athletic gave the rest of the Championship hope for the season ahead.Following an imperious start to the campaign that had seen the Tangerines stick six past both Dundee and Morton and four beyond Inverness, Robbie Neilson’s side stumbled once more on the road to the part-time Wasps to make it just one point picked up at the Indodrill Stadium out of the last nine.What’s most worrying for the Tannadice gaffer is the exposure of a soft underbelly to his team when certain key players are missing.Midfield enforcer Calum Butcher picked up a groin injury in the lead-up to the contest on Friday night, leaving the Tangerines with a central pairing of Sam Stanton and Ian Harkes.Robbie’s demeanour on the touchline in Clackmannanshire got increasingly more angry as the match wore on with the inability of his midfield to get close enough to the Alloa players.By the th minute, both Stanton and Harkes were substituted along with the ineffectual Adrian Sporle.Peter Grant’s side put together some excellent passing moves, particularly in the first half, as they ran the United defence ragged.From the Tangerines’ point of view, it was far too easy for the home side to play their way through the lines – something Butcher plays a major part in preventing when he is in the team.Another change forced upon the manager was the use of right-back Liam Smith in place of Jamie Robson, with the former Ayr man caught out for the ultimately-decisive goal.Robson is expected back for United’s next match away to Queen of the South in just less than a fortnight.The Tangerines need him, too.With right-footed Smith playing in the unfamiliar position on the left of defence, the Tangerines lack balance. vw, px\"  Argentine Sporle was brought in initially as a left full-back but has been used recently as a wide midfielder rather than being trusted in the defence.That’s left Smith to deputise in the unfamiliar role and his discomfort there showed as Alloa snatched the lead after  minutes.Smith was caught out of position as Scott Taggart played the ball inside the full-back for Kevin Cawley to scamper onto and cut across for Kevin O’Hara’s goal.And that wasn’t the end of the Wasps’ buzzing attacking play as Paul McMullan’s inexplicable decision to dribble out of his own box allowed Iain Flannigan a look at goal only for Troy Brown to save his team-mate’s blushes.Goalscorer O’Hara also flashed another effort just over following a flowing passing move with the visiting defence looking beleaguered at times in the opening half.If Alloa were incisive in attack, the travelling Tangerines certainly weren’t as star man Lawrence Shankland was starved of any real service.All the news in the lead-up to the match of course was about his call-up to the Scotland squad.And any accusation of the hitman taking his eye off the ball for this one wasn’t the case – mainly because United rarely got him on it.Just once did he break free of the Alloa shackles and was found by the United midfield as McMullan swung in a good ball.The normally prolic striker, though, couldn’t hit the target with his header.The manager accused his players of a lack of fight in the game – the rest of the promotion contenders will certainly take a lot of hope from that."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/DN5D2208-e1570102456271-376x564.jpg ","title":"we find it extremely distressing to be here in this situation

I need to keep performing so I stay in the team and hopefully that can help my cause with Wales.”Although Hedges did not receive game time when with Wales last month, he did have the benefit of training with the squad for a week.Hedges made his Welsh debut in the - friendly draw with Panama last November.His last appearance was when starting in the - friendly defeat of Trinidad in March.The experience of training alongside players like Real Madrid’s four-time Champions League Winner Gareth Bale and Juventus’ Aaron Ramsay is invaluable to the winger.He said: “Every single player would want to represent their nation and I am no dferent.“To get the opportunity to go away with Wales is huge. The squad has players like Gareth Bale and you obviously learn as much as you can from him.“To watch him for a week to  days is an unbelievable experience.“The Welsh squad is a bit like Aberdeen, as there are no big egos. With Wales everyone is friendly and it is a good group to be involved in.”Wales are set to face Slovakia away tomorrow night before hosting defeated World Cup finalists Croatia and Ballon d’Or winner Luka Modric in Cardf on Sunday.Wales’ qualier in Slovakia will be played at an empty stadium.Uefa ordered the match be played behind closed doors after penalising the Slovakian Football Association for racist chants by fans.Slovakia were sanctioned under Uefa’s disciplinary process for the behaviour of their away fans in a qualier against Hungary on September .Wales trail second-placed Slovakia by three points but have a game in hand. The Welsh are bidding to reach a second successive Euros, having made the semi-finals in .Hedges: “Hopefully we can get two good results from the qualiers with Slovakia and Croatia as that would put is in good stead for Euro qualication. Playing Slovakia behind closed doors will be a completely dferent environment and experience that the team will have to deal with.”Having missed out on selection for the qualiers, Hedges will use this week to focus on training with the Dons ahead of the games with Motherwell and Celtic after the international break.Having had six players injured for the - draw with Hibs, there are hopes that injury crisis could lessen in time to face Well.Hedges said: “The gaffer has had to rely on some youngsters to come in and shine.“Dean Campbell has stepped into big shoes to fill in for Funso Ojo and Craig Bryson.“He has come in and has done really well, which shows the strength in depth we have.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5d962bc84a3f69.65008050-375x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet could rehome any of these animals06101","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.One-year-old Marley is looking for a new home with no other pets.She can be a little stand-offish to begin with and is quite shy.She would do best in a quiet home where she can gain confidence and be pampered.She doesn’t like loud noises so wouldn’t be suited to a busy household.Can you offer Marley her forever home This handsome chap is Simba, He is two years old.Simba is still a big puppy at heart and has no idea about boundaries and his size.He will need an experienced owner with the time to continue his training and teach this clever boy some manners.He is not suitable to be rehomed around small children and is not the best behaved with other dogs.This sweet girl is two years old.Unfortunately Roxy is not fully house trained so will need a new owner who can work on this with her.She has so much love and affection to give and is really good with children.We have no history on her with other pets.Roxy is an indoor cat.Can you offer Roxy her forever home Mrs Murray#s Home for Stray Dogs and CatsTel:   "},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/a16bec73-6f61-4f7c-beee-9612457cb26b-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/a16bec73-6f61-4f7c-beee-9612457cb26b-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/a16bec73-6f61-4f7c-beee-9612457cb26b-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/a16bec73-6f61-4f7c-beee-9612457cb26b-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"fish firm puts north east base and equipment up for sale %e2%80%8b","story":"A major fish processor has put one of its north-east factories up for sale.Lunar Freezing’s entire Fraserburgh complex and its contents are now available to be purchased.An online listing said the pelagic plant had “recently stopped production” and the equipment is available for “immediate sale.”The advertisement has been posted on the Boyd International website.It said: “The factory has recently stopped production and the equipment is available for immediate sale.“Only the Fraserburgh site has closed, with the remaining Lunar sites are still operating.“The factory was mainly processing pelagic fish – mackerel, herring and blue whiting – but much of the equipment is suitable for other species, including whitefish and trout.”The complex is on the quayside at Fraserburgh harbour.The company confirmed the site stopped production in the summer with all the staff being relocated where in the business.As well as the Fraserburgh complex, Lunar Freezing has facilities in Peterhead and Aberdeen.Frasersburgh and district councillor Charles Buchan said he was “disappointed” the firm had decided to leave the town.He is hopeful the company may eventuallyto Fraserburgh in the future.

But Boyle believes the men from Balmoor can take heart from their - loss to Airdrieonians on Saturday.The Diamonds operate a hybrid squad – some full-time and some part-time players. Despite that they were dominated by Peterhead at the weekend and claimed victory due to a questionable second-half penalty.Although the Blue Toon lost, left-back Boyle saw the positives as Jim McInally’s men created a number of decent opportunities and were more solid defensively than they have been in recent weeks.The -year-old former Ayr and Dumbarton player said: “I think we have to take the positives because we were more like what we should be on Saturday.“There have been games this season where we have been deservedly beaten.“That wasn’t the case on Saturday – we played a full-time team and we were better than them. But we still lost the game, which is frustrating.“It was disappointing. We deserved to take something out of the game.“We could have had a point –not won it.“So that was a bit of a blow to us, but at least the performance was good.“Good performances have been missing at times this season so we need to take the positives and that was one.”One aspect of Saturday’s game that Boyle could not be positive about was the performance of referee Gavin Ross.The whistler seemed to infuriate both Peterhead and Airdrie with a number of his decisions over the  minutes.But the one that hurt the Blue Toon most was the decision to award a penalty to the Lanarkshire side  minutes from time, when Calum Gallacher hit the deck under very little pressure from Jamie Stevenson.Dale Carrick tucked away the spot-kick to win it for Airdrie but, unsurprisingly, Boyle had a dferent take on the big moment to ref Ross.He added: “I don’t think it was a penalty.“I think Jamie Stevenson went to win the ball.“He then pulled out and managed to get a toe on the ball through the player’s legs.“He didn’t seem to touch him and I didn’t know how the referee could see it because of the bodies that were in front of him.“It wasn’t a penalty – or not in my opinion, anyway.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

One is a #safety sleeper’ # costing almost £, # which is a safe space in which Cooper can sleep when he is away from home and his hospital-profiling bed which has bumpers to prevent him from rolling off the bed and injuring himself during the night.Zoey added: #We#re also looking at getting the Freeloader Child Carrier [costing about £] which will enable Greg to carry Cooper on his back for a few years yet, allowing him to fulfill his dream of taking Cooper to the top of Bengullion.#The money that has been raised over our total will by no means be going to waste.

identied the need for this kind of project to help tackle social isolation and loneliness in the town.The project was officially launched in the summer in the community centre, with almost half of those attending signing up to volunteer.Similar projects exist in other places called lsquoCommunity Links Projectsrsquo but the team in North Berwick wanted to do something on a dferent model.Community Connections uses members of the community to introduce others to groups and sports clubs, emphasising community development and outreach.The project is helping tackle social isolation by encouraging GPs and other health professionals to refer those at risk of isolation to ldquosocial prescribing rather than provide medication.Members of the public can also refer someone.Carol said: ldquoPeople who refer someone at risk of isolation to me may have medical problems that they need attended to, but social prescribing means that they are also trying to recommend other things that will benefit their wellbeing.ldquoIt might be to do with meeting other people, exercise or all those non-medical things that might make the biggest dference to improving their health and wellbeing overall.Carol then meets the referred person to discuss their likes and dislikes, what is important to them and what the barriers are to taking part in community groups.She then puts the inidual into

volunteer their time to accompany someone, for example, to the gym on a one-off basis.Others can meet someone over a number of occasions, providing them someone to talk to over coffee.Carol has also set up smallscale cafe meetings for those who would like to meet new people.She highlighted it was not only older people who were at risk of social isolation, referring to her own experience of losing her dad and becoming a new mother soon after.She explained how the experience left her ldquocompletely wrecked and thinking that everyone around her was coping very well.She said: ldquoThere are a lot of reasons people might feel isolated at some point.ldquoIf you have been through something that is a huge setback then your confidence is that much lower.As well as mental health, other reasons

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

The latest issue involves the upgrading of the telephone appointment system where non-urgent appointments are not available until October .ldquoThe major issue is actually getting an appointment within a reasonable period.

That, and icy fury at the behaviour of so-called ldquopick-up artists who hang about the streets, preying on young women in a bid to get their phone numbers and eventually have sex with them.ldquoOnly the brave get laid, said one practitioner of the sleazy process known as ldquogaming. His nickname was Addy A-game, real name Adnan Ahmed. You may recall the Glaswegian from a video earlier this year on The Social, a podcast from BBC Scotland.Read more:YouTube pulls pick-up videos after BBC investigationThe Social commissions short videos aimed at the - audience, covering everything from panic attacks to leaving the house with a toddler in tow. Most, it is fair to say, do not rack up huge viewing figures.Then along came the film about Ahmed by Myles Bonnar, a reporter and producer who has worked with the BBC before. Two million hits and one intervention by a First Minister laterand police acted.Police Scotland had been contacted by a whistleblower several months beforehand, but it took the film going viral, and being raised at Holyrood, to get the investigation moving.The story also came to the attention of BBC Scotlandrsquos Disclosure unit, the channelrsquos equivalent to Panorama. In what was a first for BBC Scotland, the short film for The Social was developed into a half hour investigation that was broadened to include London and the pick-up business in general.Panorama became interested, and after investing some money it received a version to show in the rest of the UK. The two programmes, with some dferences, mainly to do with dfering legal systems, aired at the same time last night. ldquoTwo for one no longer applies to just supermarkets: it is the modern, multi-ing way in the media too.Read Alison Rowats TV week:Catherine the Great, World on Fire, The Apprentice, The Capture, reviewsBonnar spoke to two young women who had been approached by Ahmed in Glasgow. Chillingly, he had secretly filmed the encounters stupidly, he had uploaded them on to the web. We saw one woman being polite but clearly trying to distance herself from him. She had, she explained later, been trying to spare his feelings.Digging deeper, Bonnar discovered a ldquoseduction industry worth, he said, pound million. It was not clear how he arrived at such a precise figure, but there were training courses advertised on the web ranging from pound for a weekend up to pound for a week abroad.Bonnar enrolled on a course and went to London to learn from a couple of self-styled Lotharios. He went undercover, which consisted of shaving his beard, changing his name, and wearing a hidden camera. Not quite Serpico, but then he was hardly dealing with the sharpest pencils in the case.After rattling along for the first half, there was a drop in pace when Bonnar ed to Glasgow to show a crosssection of young people some clips from filming. They were duly horried and angry. Who knows why, other than filling time, we needed to have such reactions set out when the viewer was doubtless feeling the same way.Otherwise, the interviews, one with an academic who had researched the industry, added context and an explanation of the law in this area. But where was the chasedown, the scene without which no piece of popular reportage is complete Bonnar supplied it at the end, confronting his ldquotutors with a confidence that hinted he will go far in this investigative journalism game. ldquoItrsquos disgusting what you guys do, said one of the exposed without a trace of irony.As for Ahmed, he was convicted last month of threatening and abusive behaviour and is awaiting sentence.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

After extensive consultation and evidence from leading charity organisations working with local academics, Holyrood rolled out legislation that would have a transformative effect on public spaces across the nation.The Parliament has also been able to be more nimble in legislating on other controversial and contentious areas such as fox hunting and to remove road bridge tolls in .And smacking children has been made illegal in Scotland after a vote in the Scottish Parliament last week – making it the first country in the UK to make smacking a criminal offence.Holyrood is designed – at least in theory – for collaboration, partnerships and connectivity.: Queen calls on Scottish Parliament to honour opponents’ views: Is a supposed benefit of Scottish Parliament one of its biggest problems  – Paris GourtsoyannisThe electoral system was originally crafted to avoid one single party forming a government with less than half the votes cast. At the time, most people were looking to introduce a more proportionate system which would closely reflect the views of the people of Scotland and produce a fairer match between the way people voted and the number of MSPs each party got elected.Scotland’s additional-member systemis seen as a compromise between the Westminster-style first-past-the-post and full proportional representation systems used on the European continent. Adversarial Westminster systemIn practice, we have seen Labour and Liberal Democrat representations form partnerships for the Parliament’s first two terms, and more unofficial arrangements between the SNP and Greens in recent years.Another way the Holyrood Parliament is more conducive to co-operation, in contrast with the more adversarial Westminster system, is how the day is structured. Committee sessions are always held in the morning and plenary sessions take place in the afternoon – meaning that MSPs do not face a time conflict by having to be in two places at the same time.The Scottish Parliament also has fantastic connectivity and access points for its citizens to engage with and influence its policymaking processes. It is specically required to openly consult with the people on draft policy proposals, facilitating better engagement opportunities for charities and citizens. This legislative process is based on the idea that the people of Scotland from all walks of le, pressure groups, and regions should participate to ensure openness and encourage connectivity, though it is not just within the confines of its chambers that Scottish institutions look to break new ground and forge connections. New partnerships can realise greater public value and offer a new gateway to engage with wider international civil society.Take the VA’s new museum in Dundee – the first-ever dedicated design museum in Scotland and the only other Victoria and Albert museum anywhere in the world outside London.

There has been a lot of work done already with a lot of preparation and education about culture in South Africa.“It is once in a letime opportunity and will give the students more of a clear direction of what they want to do in le when they come back.”Student Ryan McCarthy explained more about what the trip will entail.“We had to do a lot of fundraising which involved bag packing and setting up pages on Facebook to raise the £, required for cover our travel and donate towards dferent projects out there,” he said. “The first seven days we will spend in homeless shelters before moving to work in villages and towns outside Durban. We will be fully integrated in the community and there will be no luxuries.“We will live with local people and their families and help build houses and other things to help the community and work on dferent projects.“It will be very much a hands-on experience. It is not a holiday for us. We have also been learning the Zulu culture which is everything from song, language, games and dance, which we will use to communicate with the children who don’t speak much English. We want to respect their culture and integrate ourselves into theirs.”Another student, Holly O’Neill, believes she will take a lot from the experience.“I think the trip will teach us a lot about how we take for granted how we live back at home,” she said. “These people in South Africa are poor. We will feel lucky to live here. People complain about all the bad stuff in the news here but it is nothing compared to over there. People have nothing compared to us. The whole experience so far has given us all more confidence. We were all shy and didn’t talk much to each other but now we are all talking more and working together as a team.“The travel is daunting – around  hours – but we are all looking forward to it and want to make the most out of it. I remember the feeling when I got picked for this le changing experience, I was speechless.“The amount of dedication that has to be put in is crazy, but working as a team I know we can get through it.“Something that has really been outstanding for me has definitely been the Monday night groups that I look forward to for a good laugh and good craic.“I’m just so thankful to have been chosen for this le changing experience.”Paddy Doyle from Connections Youth Project added: “I wanted to change the project a bit and develop young leaders within a school environment.“The young people have worked really hard in their preparation so far and I know we are going to have a successful trip. I can’t wait for it. It is a new programme for me as well but it will create a lot of memories and experiences for the young people.”You can keep up to date with the young people’s journey in South Africa on the Connections Youth Project Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/bmg-advert-banner-classified-v01.png","title":"neurology waiting lists a disgrace","story":"ALLIANCE Health spokesperson Paula Bradshaw has branded the latest neurology waiting lists “a disgrace” and warned they are the latest example of people paying for others’ political irresponsibility.The South Belfast MLA was speaking after it was revealed the number of people waiting for a first neurology outpatient appointment here has more than doubled in the past four years.More than , patients have also been waiting more than one year to be seen.“The doubling of waiting lists in the past four years is the latest example of the Health Service descending into a two-tier system, with those who can afford it getting quick diagnoses and treatment while others are left to their anxiety about what is wrong for over a year. This is now a dysal system,” she said.“At the heart of this is the refusal of those with the biggest mandates to take the responsibility for governing which comes with those mandates. They know well a deal has long been available but decisions which are unpopular in the short term will need to be made for the long-term good of the healthcare system and public health.“We must never stop being shocked by figures such as these, which are unacceptable and show a decline in planning for the future, going back many years. It is time for comprehensive transformation or there simply will not be a public health service for the next generation # and it is time those with the big mandates took responsibility for delivery of it.”SDLP Deputy Leader Nichola Mallon called the waiting times for a first neurology outpatient appointment “unacceptable”.The North Belfast MLA said that staff are working tirelessly to manage demand while also coping with the biggest patient recall in history. “Neurology patients, people living with conditions like Parkinson’s disease, Motor Neurone disease or multiple sclerosis, should not be forced to endure the pain, worry and uncertainty of waiting over a year to be seen,” she said. “That’s the cruel reality for over , people who understand the seriousness of their condition and desperately want to be seen and treated as quickly as possible.“These patients and the staff working in neurology units deserve better. Aside from the immense challenge of having almost , people on the neurology waiting list, doctors and nurses are trying their best to cope with the biggest patient recall in our history. It must feel overwhelming.“We have had reviews of neurology services before. I have no doubt that the final report will reach similar conclusions with similar recommendations. They cannot be allowed to sit on a shelf gathering dust while real people suffer on hospital waiting lists. This is a scandal and we all have to commit to addressing it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit timelimited backstop rejected by sinn fein and dup its not going to happen","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

__constabledowney.jpgEmailA police firearms officer who was suspended for refusing to shave his beard has said he has been \"vindicated\" after an employment tribunal found he had been discriminated

clean-shaven.He later brought an employment tribunal case against then-Chief Constable George Hamilton claiming he had been discriminated against, a view which was supported by an employment tribunal.The PSNI has said it is aware of the tribunals findings and said it is currently examining the detail.Speaking to BBC News NI, Constable Downey said: \"To be turfed out of the unit, with little or no notice, for refusal to shave off a moustache, which doesnt affect the equipment Ive been issued with, is total madness.\"Read MoreMoustache would have to be a ‘belter’ to impair PSNI mask, tribunal toldPSNI ponytail rule not enforced like one for beards, tribunal toldPSNI firearms officer tells tribunal of his face mask concernsNew rules outlawing beards and facial hair were implemented in  for some units in the PSNI due to health and safety concerns.The updated policy required these officers to \"remain clean shaven whilst on duty\" for health and safety reasons.The case centred over whether respiratory masks used in certain police units, and which are supposed to be airtight, can be used safelythe officer has facial hair.Expert advice to the tribunal  previously claimed men would need \"a moustache like a walrus\" for the equipment not to work properly.\"The policy itself was being enforced against men under health and safety grounds, and yet females within our unit had hair in contravention of the same policy, not facial hair but head hair, where there was a grab risk,\" Constable Downey said.\"So the policy was being enforced against men and not against female officers.\"Constable Downey said he tried to accommodate the policy by shaving his beard to a moustache but was also asked to remove that.\"As an older person with a receding hairline and alopecia who is slightly overweight all I can do is grow a bit of fur on my top lip, and to have that removed for absolutely no reason is wrong,\" he said.The unanimous decision of the tribunal was that Constable Downey was discriminated against contrary to the Sex DiscriminationOrder .He was awarded over £, for hurt feelings and loss of earnings.Niall McMullan from Worthingtons SolicitorsNiall McMullan from Worthingtons Solicitors, who represented Constable Downey, said it was an important ruling.\"This is a signicant ruling by the industrial tribunal, because it has essentially declared that the current PSNI policy is discriminating indirectly against males, in as far as the application of the policy is concerned,\" he said.\"I would like to see serious steps taken by the PSNI in relation to this decision.\"The tribunal were unequivocal in so far as they want the PSNI to review this decision and to ensure it has a less discriminatory effect on not just my

Over , people in two months is astonishing. We need a closer look at the figures to seethey really reflect the situation. \"The figures are so high I doubt they could be people just not turning up because cars need MoTs - unless theyre suggesting there are a lot of cars driving around without their MoTs.\"The longest waiting time for an MoT test is at Omagh test centre , followed by Enniskillen , Armagh, Belfast and Cookstown .Motorists getting their MoTs done at the Ballymena test centre had the shortest waiting time .The new figures show that  MoT tests were cancelled in August, and  were cancelled last month.The Driver and Vehicle Agencyis responsible for licensing and testing vehicles and drivers in Northern Ireland. It comes under the remit of DfI.A DfI spokesman said the department is doing everything possible to reduce the backlog. \"DVA is currently testing over , vehicles per week,\" he said.\"In recent months, the appointment of additional staff, together with Sunday and bank holiday openings, have helped manage the increase in applications for tests and reduce waiting times. \"We will continue to keep these arrangements under review and would continue to encourage customers to book their MoT online as soon as they receive the reminder notice.\"In June it emerged that drivers were facing waits of up to  days after an increase of around , applications for tests in the first three months of .The trend continued all summer, with many drivers at risk of breaking the law by driving without a valid vehicle certicate due to being unable to secure an appointment.Sunday appointments were added to the schedule over the summer, alongside an increase in the recruitment of staff at centres."},{"url":null,"title":"donegal businessman calls for government to give clarity on brexit spending","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is hampering and killing off businesses in the border area.“They need to change the VAT from .% back to %.

I have previously heard that there would be more money but it need to go to border areas as it’s a border issue and industry problem.“As an operator, I will be watching to see where this is being made available.“There is going to be causalities and there is no celebration, and central Dublin does not get how severe it is.”Oyster farmer and owner of Killowen Shellfish Darren Cunningham said the threat of Brexit has stalled investing more money in his business.Darren, who works at Carlingford Lough, has been an oyster farmer for ten years.“As someone who works on the border I cannot forward-plan, I just hope for the best,” he said.“I would have invested three or four times more had it not been for the threat of Brexit. I cannot throw money at something that I don’t know whether it will work.“I think the Irish government has done everything it can to address the fears people have about Brexit.“I think tarfs will be bad – we are shipping out live oysters which are picked up by a southern company on a Friday and by midday Sunday it will reach our customers.“The oysters are alive and in good condition so we are very worried about delays. It’s my biggest fear as they are living creatures.”Darren, whose business is north of the border, said he does not expect the same Brexit contingency funding from the UK Government.“No-one knows what will happen because no-one can give us an answer,” he added.“I wouldn’t imagine theywill do anything like that as Stormont isn’t up and running.

Other members carried a coffin with ‘NHS’ and ‘DIGNITY written on the side of it.Other messages on fake gravestones signied the death of human rights, mental healthcare, funding in education and health, and the loss of housing and welfare rights.It most certainly caught the attention of weekend shoppers who seemed confused as to whether or not it was a real funeral until they read the messages.At the Guildhall an excerpt from the film I Daniel Blake was played. It is from the funeral scene where his friend Katie reads the eulogy, including the speech Daniel had intended to read at an appeal for his jobseeker’s allowance.The speech describes his feelings about how the welfare system failed him by treating him like a dog instead of a man proud to have paid his dues to society.AAC member, Kat Healy, took to the steps of the Guildhall first to thank those who turned out for the march. In the spirit of the original civil rights march people were taking a stand against injustice, she said.People Before Profit Councillor, Shaun Harkin, also reflected on the march in  which “changed history here in the North of Ireland”. He said the numbers turning out to protest at present don’t accurately represent the depth of “anger” in the local community which is “growing and growing”.Cllr Harkin added that it is important to put pressure on “leaders” to address the devastation felt by local communities.‘Direct Action’googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnother AAC member from Strabane, Michael Mclaughlin, told the crowd that he has been fighting against welfare reform for the best part of a decade.“The system is broken,” he said, and is part of an “ideological attack” on the working class. He referred to a research paper published by a university in Sheffield which studied the impact of welfare reform in the UK.A table included in that report which took in all  local authorities in the UK at the time, shows that people living in Derry and Strabane will be impacted the most with working age adults anticipated to be £ worse off per annum. Blackpool sits at the top of the table, Derry is second, Strabane third and Belfast is fourth.Mr McLaughlin said people can point the finger at Stormont but also need to look “closer to home”. It is time to “inject radicalism into activism”, he said, by getting working class people out on the streets and occupying offices were these cuts are being implemented.“We need to organise a direct action campaign against neo-liberalism, against austerity and expose and call out the parties that have let everybody down.”Member of the Irish Travelling Community, Martin McDonagh, said he was proud to be taking action and made clear that his community has felt the impact of cuts more than most.Becca Bor of Alliance for Choice slammed the two-child policy and benefit cap which she said have “massively increased” child poverty. Although primarily campaigning for free safe legal and local abortion in Ireland, the group has also fought “tooth and nail” against welfare reform, she said.She added that families are having to “scrape” money together essentials and said there is a need to fight so that women and families “have what they need”.The final speaker on the day, Goretti Horgan, of Derry Trades Union Council said large families have been impacted most by benefit caps and self-employed workers such as taxi drivers.She urged people to join a trade union, saying weekends off, holiday pay and sick pay wouldn’t exist without trade unions. “Don’t believe the hype when the Tories say they’re bringing in a living wage, read the small print, they’re saying it will happen in five years by which time normal wage increases will have brought it to that level,” she concluded."},{"url":null,"title":"foyleside student night set biggest best yet","story":" Magician Joel Mawhinney who will be performing mindblowing tricks to students on Foylesides Student NightThere will also be music from Q Radio, giveaways from Red Bull and VIP passes provided by Derry’s top student bars on the night to get students ready for some post-shopping drinks.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTo keep the students refreshed throughout their shopping spree there will be popcorn, slush drinks, a pick ‘n’ mix cart and doughnut walls – there really is something for everyone!Fergal Rafferty, Centre Manager of Foyleside, said: “For this year’s student night, we wanted to introduce entertaining and collaborative activities to get the students excited and encouraged to make great memories with their new peers – as well as grab a few bargains!

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/10465247.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

The secret Masterplan has been sought after for several years with many groups and activists keen to get a copy.Alliance Councillor Eóin Tennyson, who was elected last May to the new council, says he also has been unable to see a copy of the Masterplan.He called for an end to secrecy as Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council appeal a ruling by the Information Commission requiring the release of the South Lake Masterplan. Speaking after the Alliance group on Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council once again requested the release of the document, Eóin said: “The Council’s ongoing refusal to place the South Lake Masterplan in the public realm falls far short of the standard of open and transparent governance citizens in our borough rightly expect. “It is totally unacceptable that – despite our numerous requests – even elected representatives have not been given sight of the document.“In June , the Information Commission ruled that Council had not applied the regulations for withholding information correctly, and ordered release of the document within  calendar days,” said Cllr Tennyson.“What’s more concerning is that Council then took a backroom decision to appeal this ruling, without consulting elected representatives,” he said. “Alliance is committed to openness and transparency,” saidCllr Tennyson.“In our view, fighting disclosure of a document that the public and their representatives ought to have had sight of from the outset is a wholly inappropriate and worrying use of ratepayer’s money,” said the councillor.“We will continue to push for progress on this matter and hold ABC Council to account.”A spokesperson for Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Council said: “The Council is not in a position to comment given that this matter is subject to ongoing active legal proceedings.”‘Scourge of drugs and dissident republicans’ topics of DUP meeting with senior PSNI chief Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingNotorious NI crossroads, plagued with accidents, to get reduced speed limitThieves ransack womanrsquo home while she was out on volunteer community workEmergency services at scene of serious N.I. road traffic collision -

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here. SONIhas said the five-year plan to transform the power system here will enable it to handle % renewable energy at any one time. This is a signicant increase from the current figure of % and is said to be a \"world leading level, ensuring maximum value from wind and other sources\". To achieve this, it is expected that the amount of renewable energy connected to the grid will need to double by . At the moment, approximately  MW of renewable energy is connected to the NI power system. SONI managing director Jo Aston said that the strategy was a \"direct response to the climate crisis and the UK Governments commitment to zero net carbon emissions by \" “To do this we must innovate for the next generation while ensuring today’s electricity users have a reliable, secure and cost-effective supply,” she said.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years.

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
