Outgoing North America editor Sopel is thought to have nearly doubled his BBC pay of up to £234,999.Newsnight presenter Maitlis is believed to have got a pay rise from her salary band of up to £329,999. One source described the deal as an \u0027irresistible package\u0027. Recent departures have sparked talk of a \u0027brain drain\u0027 and \u0027exodus\u0027 at the corporation\u0027s news ision.BBC insiders said they believed Maitlis - who has been at the corporation since 2001 - quit in part because she was \u0027frustrated\u0027 at being \u0027ticked-off\u0027 over impartiality.She was at the centre of a row in 2020 when the BBC decided she had breached rules in a monologue about Dominic Cummings\u0027s trip to Durham during lockdown.In June, she was reprimanded for sharing a Twitter post by Piers Morgan about the pandemic that the corporation said was \u0027clearly controversial\u0027.A senior source said the pair\u0027s defection was \u0027extraordinary\u0027 particularly as Sopel was the \u0027clear front-runner\u0027 to replace Kuenssberg as political editor.Prior to becoming the BBC\u0027s politics editor, Kuenssberg served as the corporation\u0027s chief political correspondent. She also previously held senior roles at ITV News and BBC Two\u0027s Newsnight.In 2016, Kuenssberg was awarded Broadcaster of the Year by the Political Studies Association, recognising her work covering the Brexit Referendum and subsequent follow-up stories.She was also honoured as the Journalist of the Year at the British Journalism Awards the same year. "},{"url":null,"title":"Hypocritical Hollywood elite party Smith","story":"Share this articleShare this article   Most recently, the couple found themselves the butt of a joke earlier this month after Smith scooped Best Actor for his role in King Richard at the 75th Annual British Academy Film Awards.BAFTAs host Rebel Wilson, 41, quipped on stage: \u0027I thought his best performance over the past year was being OK with all his wife\u0027s boyfriends!\u0027Speaking afterwards, Smith insisted that there has \u0027never been infidelity\u0027, despite Jada admitting in 2020 that she had an \u0027entanglement\u0027 with singer August Alsina, 29.\u0027There\u0027s never been infidelity in our marriage.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill  The A 20c levy on disposable coffee cups is expected to come into effect by the fourth quarter of this year, according to Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Ossian Smyth.Levies against a range of single-use items will be charged under legislation approved by cabinet on Tuesday. The law will also see the increased use of CCTV to combat fly tipping, among other environmental measures.Mr Smyth said the aim of the disposable cup levy was not to raise money but to change consumer habits.The environmental levies on the single-use items will be ringfenced and put into a circular economy fund - and the rate of the levy will be set out in regulations after the bill is passed later this year.The legislation also envisages mandatory segregation and an incentivised charging regime for commercial waste, as exists in the household market - currently, commercial premises can dispose of their waste through a single, unsegregated bin.The use of security cameras to deter illegal dumping has been curtailed by data protection laws which limit their use under strict European digital privacy laws called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).However, the Government says the circular economy bill provides for the GDPR-compliant use of a range of technologies, including CCTV, for waste enforcement purposes - while “protecting the privacy rights of citizens”.“This will help to discourage fly tipping, which is a blight across the country,” the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications said in a statement. It said the aim of the bill would be to shift from its current model to a more sustainable patter of production and consumption that minimises waste - the so-called “circular economy”.Disposable productsThis aims to use and re-use products that have reached the end of their useful life. It also seeks to drive down the use of single-use disposable products - including disposable coffee cups. Nearly half a million of them are sent to landfill or for incineration every day, the department said, amounting to 200 million cups a year.Mr Smyth said the legislation “aims to stop the wasteful pattern of using valuable resources once and then just binning them. From discouraging the use of single-use items, to improving the process for allowing recycled materials onto the market, this legislation will support the development of sustainable products and business models across the economy”.Speaking to RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Smyth said there would be plenty of time over the summer for people to get used to having a “keep cup”.“I have a collapsible keep cup that goes flat in to my pocket and also smaller ones for a flat white. There is a lot of practical ways to do this. It doesn’t have to be a big difficulty,” he said.“It is very similar to the plastic bag levy. People will remember when that came in we were using a giant number of plastic bags and after the levy came in the reduction was 95 percent in the use of plastic bags.”The bill also aims to give legal effect to the programme for government commitment to end new licenses for the exploration and extraction of gas - the Department said it “effectively calls time” on coal exploration by ending the issuing of new licenses for the exploration and mining of coal, lignite and oil shale.The bill also seeks to support the increases use of recycled or reused materials in the Irish market. It will, for the first time, define the circular economy in Irish law.Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan said the publication was a “landmark moment”.“Through a mix of economic incentives and smarter regulation we can achieve far more sustainable patterns of production and consumption that move us away from the patterns of single-use and throw-away materials and goods that are such a wasteful part of our economic model now,” he said.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"why are young irish women losing money through online sales jobs","story":"Karina O’Dowd got involved in multi-level marketing after she became desperate for a job. Photograph: Brian FarrellLong before the pandemic, Karina O’Dowd was already looking for opportunities to work from home. It was 2017 and the young Sligo woman was dealing with a health condition that required her to work remotely.“I was getting sick of being on social welfare, I’d been on it for so long,” O’Dowd told the In the News podcast. “I looked on several job websites to look for working at home, it was really limited, there was really nothing at the time. And then, somebody got in touch with me from over in England. ”O’Dowd was offered the chance to join the online sales team of a skincare company with the flexibility to choose her own working hours. She was sceptical at first but eventually decided to give the opportunity a go.O’Dowd spent the next 12 months losing her money while working for free for a multi-level marketing company (MLM).MLMs have grown in popularity across the UK and Ireland in recent years, particularly during the pandemic when online companies wooed iniduals who were struggling financially with the promise of big money and work-from-home flexibility.Young mums and those with health conditions who are unable to work outside the home are often targeted by these companies through online adverts.But what exactly are these MLMs and is there anything illegal about how they operate? reporters Jessica Doyle and Adesewa Awobadejo speak to the podcast about the investigation they carried out into MLMs in Ireland, while Karina O’Dowd described the year she spent working for one of these companies.Today: How young Irish women are losing money in too-good-to-be-true social media sales jobsIn the News is presented by reporters Sorcha Pollak and Conor Pope.

Photograph: Alan BetsonAll workers will be entitled to 10 days paid sick leave by 2026 under plans which have been approved by Cabinet.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar is expected to unveil the legislation on Wednesday, and announce it will be phased in to help employers deal with any additional costs.Under the Sick Leave Bill 2022, approved by Cabinet on Tuesday, workers will be covered for three days from this year and this will rise to five days in 2024, seven days in 2025 and 10 days in 2026.It will be paid by employers at a rate of 70 per cent of an employee’s wage, up to a daily maximum threshold of €110.The threshold is based on 2019 mean weekly earnings of €786.33 and equates to an annual salary of €40,889.The rate could be revised by ministerial order in line with inflation and changing incomes.The employee will have to obtain a medical certificate to avail of statutory sick pay and the entitlement is subject to the employee having worked for their employer for a minimum of 13 weeks.Mr Varadkar said, while he accepted many businesses are struggling with additional costs because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Covid-19 and Brexit, he believes it strikes a balance.“It is why we have chosen to phase this in, in this way. We have made a big effort to design the scheme so that it’s easy to use, fair and affordable for employers.“We’ve done a lot of consultation on this, with representatives from both the employee and employer side and although I know some will think it goes too far and others that it doesn’t go far enough, I think it has struck a fair and reasonable balance.”At present, sick leave is provided to about half of all employees through their terms and conditions.The new legislation states the plan does not prevent employers offering better terms or unions negotiating for more through a collective agreement.Mandatory scheme“Ireland is one of the few advanced countries in Europe not to have a mandatory sick-pay scheme and although many, we think approximately half, of employers do provide sick pay, we need to make sure that security, that safety net, is there for all workers, regardless of their job. It has to be one of the legacies of the pandemic. It will be available to all workers, regardless of their illness,” Mr Varadkar said.Senior Siptu official Greg Ennis said the provisions being announced by Mr Varadkar do not go far enough and their introduction may be seen as an opportunity in some sectors to drop existing occupational schemes.Referring to the situation in the State’s meat plants, Mr Ennis – the union’s manufacturing ision organiser – said 38 per cent of workers in the sector had had Covid-19 during the first 22 months of the pandemic. He said incidence within the industry remains particularly high because workers are unable to afford to take sick leave when ill.Addressing Siptu’s annual conference in Sligo, he said 93 per cent of the 15,600 workforce in the Irish red and white meat sectors do not have sick-pay provision.“Consequently, they’re put in the invidious position of deciding whether to attend work or not when they have symptoms, because if you’re earning €450 or €480 a week, which is the basic pay for most of these workers, losing a third of your income by dropping to the enhanced illness benefit isn’t really an option.”Mr Varadkar’s approach to dealing with this issue has been too slow, he added. “It’s also extremely limited in its structure with regard to getting into 10 days sick pay over four years. It’s not nearly good enough.”"},{"url":null,"title":"brandon lewis plays down prospect of triggering article 16","story":"Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis: ‘I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal.’  Photograph: James ManningPA Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis has played down the prospect of triggering article 16 and acknowledged Britain is legally obliged to carry out checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. He told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster the checks demanded by the Northern Ireland protocol are “legal requirements” and it was right they were continuing despite threats by DUP Ministers to halt them. “Of course, even taking those away doesn’t necessarily in and of itself even solve some of the issues that businesses are having,” he said. He said the reason Britain did not trigger article 16 was because the government was committed to reaching an agreement with the European Commission, adding that “Article 16 doesn’t scrap the protocol.” Mr Lewis is not directly involved in the protocol negotiations which are led by foreign secretary Liz Truss and European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic. He said he believed Mr Sefcovic was eager to reach a deal but that he was hamstrung by negotiating red lines set out by EU leaders. “I think he is someone who is pragmatic, he would like to try to find a way through this. But he is trying to work within a mandate and I think there is a real issue that the mandate from his point of view may not give him the flexibility to find a way through this so far,” he said. ‘Pragmatism and flexibility’“I have not seen the sort of flexibility from the EU that I would have expected to see. I have not seen the sort of pragmatism and flexibility that would allow us to agree a deal. Otherwise we would have agreed one by now.” Describing the protocol as unsustainable, Mr Lewis said it was not working for business and 200 companies in Great Britain were no longer shipping goods to Northern Ireland. The committee’s chairman, Simon Hoare, pointed out that trade from Great Britain to Northern Ireland had increased since the protocol came into force. Mr Lewis defended his government’s decision to renege on the protocol it had itself negotiated, which he said was undermining the Belfast Agreement. Trade declineIn a separate committee hearing at Westminster on Monday, chancellor of the exchequer Rishi Sunak admitted Brexit was causing problems for British businesses which trade with Europe. The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR), an independent fiscal watchdog, said last week that trade as a share of the economy had fallen in Britain by 2½ times more than any other major industrialised country. “It was always inevitable that there would be a change in our trade intensity with Europe as a result of the change in trading relationship,” Mr Sunak said. “Without a doubt we are changing out trading relationship with the EU and that means a different set of controls and things that people will have to do. Obviously that will have an impact and I’m sure that’s a big part of the reason this is happening. It may just be a bit early to be definitive about which bits are doing what.” "},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics a disappointing patrick s day for the taoiseach covid s resurgence","story":"Hugh catches up with Pat Leahy, fresh from his trip to Washington for Micheál Martin’s ill-fated St Patrick’s Day visit.

Photograph: John FlemingEngraving depicting the Halifax Gibbet, an early guillotine, or decapitating machine, used in the town of Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. Dated 17th century. Photograph:  Universal History ArchiveUniversal Images Group via Getty ImagesA huge After Eight sign the size of say 8,000 After-Eights towers the other side of the train tracks. Adjacent on another external wall of the sweet factory is an even larger illustration declaring “Quality Street: Proudly made in Halifax since 1936”. What time is the next train back to Leeds? These gags are too easy: it is scheduled for a little after eight. A metal electronic display box hangs from the platform rafters. Switched on, its showbiz lightbulb illumination conveys one word: “OFF”. Conceptually intriguing. A 39-minute train trip from Leeds, Halifax does not exactly sit in the popular consciousness. Apart from its titular financial institution to which it has, as it were, “lent” its name. While The Halifax is indeed in Halifax and its final X does indeed mark the spot, a stroll around the West Yorkshire town does much to extricate it from that bankable brand.And while there is indeed a Halifax branch there, along with the confectionery factory, visitors might suffer some semantic confusion about the town’s less-well-known identifier: the gibbet. This is conveniently found on Gibbet Street. But ask a random stranger the way: “You mean the device for lopping people’s heads off? Straight ahead.” Ask a second stranger: “You mean that gallows thing? Swing a right.”An innocuous square houses a 1974 reconstruction of this grisly execution device: the Halifax Gibbet. The bony-and-bleached-wood frame rises up from a tired concrete plinth. Its rusted metal plate fails to glint in the sun. For it is a mere dull substitute for the original blade, which is stored elsewhere for safety. This was a horrible place of execution for centuries of ill-fated petty criminals. Home and dryBut hope springs eternal if you cling to a local legend: The Running Man. This held out the promise that if, as a condemned man or woman, you freed your head once the blade started to descend and then legged it sharply the 500 yards to the other side of the boundary marking the jurisdiction, you were home and dry. The legend even has it that one man, John Lacey, managed this feat in 1617. A historical triumph for the underdog. Sadly – and in hindsight rather unwisely – some seven years later, poor Lacey crossed back into the clearly dangerous jurisdiction of Halifax. He was still a marked man. The long arm of the law got him again. The running man’s luck ran out and he was unable to escape a second decapitation.This brutal reminder of the perils of petty crime stands close to the Calderdale Sports and Social Club, and King’s Cross Carpets. For life goes on. The legendary Manchester band The Blue Orchids are even set to play in town tonight. (Eerily, they have a song called A Year With No Head. And another called The Hanging Man.) The venue is the Grayston Unity, a name conducive to the notion it might be some type of cult, a spiritual collective into which one might be absorbed and never be heard of again. Di’s PiesHalifax has other charms such as the Piece Hall – a vast colonnaded square once dedicated to the trading of the region’s wool and the best of its worsted products. A woman nearby sings a cover version of The Sound of Silence. Two cups of instant coffee (one with sugar) for two pounds are enjoyed in the Concorde Coffee House in the Victorian borough market. They wash down an award-winning pie from Di’s Pies.Halifax is peaceful, unhurried. But it perturbed me with a dark puzzle: why call a guillotine a gibbet when I had always understood a gibbet to be a gallows? Mystery is worn well by many towns. One man’s guillotine is another man’s gallows. Both are ghastly. At precisely a little after eight, the Grayston Unity door swings open. But there is no heaving crowd. No band tuning up. An ancient fear of arriving at the wrong venue resurfaces: “Where are The Blue Orchids playing? Is there an upstairs?” The barman apologises profusely. A sentence links a band member with the wretched Covid and explains the abrupt cancellation of the gig earlier that morning. “But we came over from Dublin . . .” He looks crestfallen. And so do we.But an evening in that lovely bar unfolds. The Halifax Grayston Unity. By the miracle of Facebook, cult singer Martin Bramah sends a friendly personal text. The ale is good.

They are also armed with torpedoes for engaging sub-surface targets.The Russian military has been steadily increasing its presence in the region since its own Arctic strategy in 2008, launched by then-president Dmitri Medvedev.A defence source said the militarisation of the region was led by Russia and that the UK and Nato had intervened to keep the region open in accordance with international law.The melting sea ice also provides the opportunity for faster trade routes to Asia from the West, which China is expected to exploit as part of its Polar Silk Road initiative, and more natural resources including oil will become available as ice shelves disappear.The 16-page UK document, designed to set Arctic military policy for a decade, says Britain will “advocate for Nato to take a more proactive approach to the High North”.UK troops will also carry out more training exercises in the region, such as Exercise Cold Response, which is taking place over the next month and involves around 30,000 troops from 27 countries.It is the largest of its kind to take place in Norway for 30 years and involves UK forces including a Royal Navy Astute-class “hunter-killer” submarine and specialist reconnaissance commandos from the Royal Marines.“In addition to cold weather warfare training in Norway, the UK will seek to take advantage of further invitations and conduct cold weather training in Canada, Finland and the United States on a regular basis,” the strategy said. “In support of these capabilities, UK Defence will examine options to bolster its cold weather capability to ensure that Arctic-appropriate equipment, activity, environmental support and infrastructure are all developed and maintained.”In the longer term, the document commits the Ministry of Defence to deploy technology in space to gather intelligence and perform reconnaissance.Mr Wallace said: “Melting sea ice in the Arctic brings both opportunities and threats, with Russia taking an increasingly militarised approach to the region and China supporting its proposed Polar Silk Road with a range of infrastructure and capabilities with dual-use potential. “As the region becomes increasingly accessible, threats from elsewhere around the globe could spill over into the Arctic.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow and Beijing creating ‘just, democratic world order’ says Sergei LavrovUK to withdraw judges from Hong Kong because of \u0026#39systematic erosion of democracy\u0026#39Politics latest news: \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 iniduals handed fines will \u0026#39take responsibility\u0026#39, says Dominic Raab despite police withholding namesTory MP Jamie Wallis comes out as trans and reveals he was a victim of rapeOckenden Review: Mothers were blamed for their babies\u0026#39 deaths in Shropshire maternity scandalRussian artists won\u0026#39t be cancelled at Edinburgh International Festival despite invasionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer cannot say woman not fit pm","story":"It is the great new ide in British politics. No longer are the parties defined by their attitudes to taxation and spending. Gone are the days when great ideological arguments were joined over the limits of state interventionism. Worryingly, there is a growing pre-Thatcherite consensus emerging around these issues, a return to what was dubbed Butskellism in the late 1950s.No, the great schism today is gender based, or, more accurately, biological.Who could possibly disagree with that statement or find it remotely contentious? Obviously, a vanishingly small group of activists fulminated that this was somehow intolerant of people seeking to assert their gender identity through surgery, which it clearly wasn’t. But I suspect the vast majority of people are with the Prime Minister on this and would not consider what he said to be controversial or lacking in compassion.What on earth is he talking about? To find a way through what, exactly – how to say something that is true without being denounced by a handful of very vocal campaigners? Labour spokesmen have evidently decided to run away whenever they are asked a question that just a few years ago would not even have occurred to anyone.When Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, was asked recently to define what a woman is, she said she didn’t want to go down that “rabbit hole”. Anneliese Dodds, who speaks for Labour on women’s issues, got into an even bigger tangle when the same question was put to her. “It does depend on the context surely. There are people who have decided that they have to make that transition... because they live as a woman they want to be defined as a woman.”Her comments prompted the author JK Rowling to suggest Ms Dodds might be in need of both a dictionary and a backbone. And therein lies the point. This is no longer a debate about gender but free speech.Rowling, the country’s most successful living writer, has been excoriated for seeking to defend the rights of women from the trans lobby’s encroachment on their hard-won advances over the decades. She is a big enough international figure to withstand the brickbats. According to her publishers Bloomsbury, the sales of her Harry Potter books remain unaffected by the stand she has taken.The same cannot be said for Graham Linehan. Few people have made me laugh as much over the years as Linehan, whose Father Ted and The IT Crowd are masterpieces of the surreal comedy genre. Yet because he has fallen foul of trans activists by standing up for women’s rights, his entire career has been trashed. He broke down during a TV interview at the weekend as he described how he had lost his commissions and his marriage had collapsed. A stage musical version of Father Ted has been axed just as it was in rehearsals, while media companies and showbusiness friends have turned their backs on him. “They took everything from me,” he said.But who are “they”? At least with the Inquisition you knew who was behind it and what the consequences were for challenging theological orthodoxy decreed by the medieval Church. But who are today’s Torquemadas metaphorically dragging heretics to the stake?This is being perpetrated by pusillanimous politicians, craven corporate bosses and spineless luvvies who lack the guts to stand up to the new fanaticism, even if it means trampling on the rights of those who are prepared to confront it. They fear that they will be targeted and yet it is in their hands to end the madness by not “cancelling” those deemed by a tiny minority to have uttered something they don’t like.Unless politicians like Sir Keir call this nonsense out, the lunatic fringe will prevail and the voters will take note of who stood where, not least women who see their rights being so carelessly set aside.The Labour leader has claimed that the law states that trans women are women, drawing a withering response from Rowling who said it was “yet another indication that the Labour Party can no longer be counted on to defend women’s rights”.They cannot be counted on either to defend the right to free speech by supporting those, even in their own party, who disagree with what is an eminently contestable point of view. Angela Rayner, the party’s deputy leader, sank deeper into the mire yesterday by saying it was reasonable “in some circumstances” to ask a trans man if they were pregnant. She added: “It wouldn’t be a reasonable question for me to say ‘Have you got a penis or not?’ because that’s not acceptable.” But no one is suggesting that. It is an Aunt Sally to duck the real issue. No sensible person wants to see trans people ostracised.Labour suffered at the polls in 2019 because it was led by someone who voters thought totally unsuitable to be prime minister. Traditional Labour seats fell like ninepins not necessarily because they had warmed to Boris but because Jeremy Corbyn was considered weak and unpatriotic.Sir Keir and his front-bench team are alienating voters once again with their absurd refusal to say what everyone knows to be true on the spurious grounds that it would be intolerant to do so. Yet the bigotry is coming from radical trans activists, not the other way round, by shutting down the very discussion that Sir Keir said he is so anxious to have but clearly isn’t.A politician who refuses to say whether a woman has a penis or a man a cervix is not fit to lead a government. If he carries on doing so he never will.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Moscow and Beijing creating ‘just, democratic world order’ says Sergei LavrovUK to withdraw judges from Hong Kong because of \u0026#39systematic erosion of democracy\u0026#39Politics latest news: \u0026#39Partygate\u0026#39 iniduals handed fines will \u0026#39take responsibility\u0026#39, says Dominic Raab despite police withholding namesTory MP Jamie Wallis comes out as trans and reveals he was a victim of rapeOckenden Review: Mothers were blamed for their babies\u0026#39 deaths in Shropshire maternity scandalRussian artists won\u0026#39t be cancelled at Edinburgh International Festival despite invasionMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"government should restore 20 universal","story":"Exclusive: Government should restore £ Universal Credit uplt and help struggling familiesFormer Prime Minister Gordon Brown writes exclusively for the Mirror. He is calling on the government to restore the £ Universal Credit uplt and take steps to help families facing higher billsGordon Brown says the government should restore the £ Universal Credit uplt Image: Getty ImagesopinionByGordon Brown:,  Mar |commentsFor most of our lives the British welfare state has been there for us when we require it – to lt us up when we are down, to provide a safety net for the most vulnerable and to take the shame out of need. But on Friday, as a result of Rishi Sunak’s betrayal of the poor, it passes a point of no . Everywhere prices are going up and families are having to meet fast rising bills not only for bread, milk and the most basic of foods, but for mobile phones, clothes and laundry, with affording gas and electricity now the biggest additional burden. But instead of doing more to help people in need, our welfare state is doing much less. Look at the fate of a typical family on Universal Credit hit by Sunak’s quadruple whammy of tax rises, benefit cuts, and a % rise in food bills and % rise in heating costs.  A family with three children who have already seen the value of their benefits go down seven times in the last  years will receive just £ a week, net of council tax. And, according to Loughborough Universityaposs Minimum Income Standard based on what members of the general public think is essential for managing, they will receive less than half the £ they need for food, travel, phone, clothes, laundry and the basic needs of a family of five. For families are now being hit not just by below-inflation benefit changes, but by the insidious two child rule - that instead of the £ they need a week to bring up their third child, they receive only £.. Thousands are now being hit too by the benefits cap, which sets an upper ceiling for payments no matter your weekly requirements, and many more are carrying the burden of paying back loans they received to get them through the five weeks wait when they were transferred from the old benefits system to Universal Credit.  What would you thinkyou went to an NHS hospital and they said they could only offer you half the care you need  Or sent your children to school and they were told theyaposd get only half time education  So itaposs wrong for the welfare state to offer just half what people need. The hit on living standards is now so severe that respected Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis, who has spent years helping people manage their budgets by switching suppliers and getting the best bargains, says he has “run out of tools” to make good the gap between people’s weekly incomes and their needs. And the foodbanks and charities that are being forced to stand in for the welfare state, as the last line of defence for low income families, are being asked to do the impossible. I work with my local family centre and foodbank and know that they are doing everything they can - securing donations, putting on additional services, like mental health counselling, providing advice on heating, including on insulation, and helping pay gas and electricity bills.  I am in awe of the voluntary help that people, who don’t have much, offer to people who have nothing. And recently in Fe, my home county, we have extended the help we can offer, teaming up with Amazon, Scotmid, the Co-op and local firms to create a warehouse of their surplus goods - from toiletries, nappies and kettles to childrenaposs clothes and microwaves - to deliver to families in need. But all the voluntary efforts in the world simply cannot replace the money lost - not least from the withdrawal last autumn of £ a week from six million families when Universal Credit was cut. And in the last few weeks, as gas and electricity bills rise, we have been appealing for duvets, blankets, sheets, pillows and beds to help mothers who canapost afford to turn up their heating and who during cold, winter nights have been desperate for ways to keep their children warm.

The next fuel hike will come in September when gas and electricity bills could rise another % and poor families will be faced with an even starker choice of feeding their meters or feeding their children. By next winter, five million children will be in poverty - the worst figure in  years. Before that the Government must be forced to change tack. A campaign has to be mounted with churches and faith groups, charities, foundations, metro mayors, local authority leaders and the devolved administrations not just to restore the lost £ and to offer more direct help with heating costs, but - as anti-poverty groups want - to raise benefits by %, the real rate of inflation this spring. No one who cares about what’s happening to millions of children can walk by on the other side.

Lord Lebedev, who owns the Independent and London Evening Standard, also claimed the Labour leader sent him a text congratulating him at the time. He said: Openness and transparency are pillars of our democratic system, so I welcome the call for security advice about me provided to HOLAC to be released. I have nothing to hide.And in the spirit of transparency here is a text to me from Keir Starmer : ‘Congratulations on your elevation to the House of Lords.

The PMaposs former aide, Dominic Cummings, has claimed he was in the room when Mr Johnson was told by Cabinet Office officials that the “intelligence services and other parts of the deep state” had “serious reservations” about the PM’s plan to appoint the media tycoon to the Lords. A Labour source, meanwhile, defended Mr Starmeraposs text and said the public deserve to know why the PM intervened, adding: It was Boris Johnson who secretly overruled the security services to give Lord Lebedev a seat in our parliament.None of this was publicly known at the time. The crossbench peer, who owns the London Evening Standard and got his vast wealth from his father, is known to be close to the Prime Minister, having previously hosted him at a party at his Italian mansion in , when Mr Johnson was Foreign Secretary.Opening the debate, Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner spoke of “serious questions” over Lord Lebedev’s peerage.She said: “The commission concluded it could not support his nomination. Forty-eight hours later, the Prime Minister visited Lebedev at his home in London. “Details of that meeting have never been released to the public and questions remain about whether the security services knew about this meeting or whether their assessments show that the Kremlin were keeping tabs on these activities.” In July , Lord Lebedev’s appointment as a peer was announced, she said, adding: “So the question is this, what changed between the security warning and the appointment  “The British public have a right to knowand how an inidual of apparent concern to our intelligence services was granted a seat at the heart of Parliament by personal order of the Prime Minister.  “Whether the Prime Minister was aware of that security advice but chose to ignore it, overrule it, or even demand that be changed.” Cabinet Office minister Michael Ellis accused Labour of seeking to “whip up anti-Russian feeling”. He said: “Not all Russians are our enemy. Many British citizens of Russian extraction came to this country with a view to an opposition to President Putin. People cancelling Tchaikovsky concerts is not appropriate and Labour seeking to whip up anti-Russian feeling, casting all persons of Russian extraction in a negative light is wrong.”But Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, intervening, said he had lived and worked in Russia for three years before adding: “I’d humbly ask him to withdraw the comment about Russophobia – we have no problem with the Russian people, we have a big problem with what he’s talking about today.”Mr Ellis said disclosing the information requested by Labour would “undermine the very role” of the House of Lords Appointments Commission. But when asked by Labour MP Sarah Owen why Conservative MPs would not vote against the motion, Mr Ellis replied: “It’s quite normal practice to ignore Opposition motions. They are given the careful attention that they deserve.

I cannot imagine that you would wish to compel an employer to bring about its own downfall, affecting not hundreds but thousands of families.

Putin has surrounded himself with a tight inner circle of trusted staff. But Western officials doubt the loyal acolytes can be honest with or have influence over their feared leader. One Western official said: “Eventhey were capable of influencing him, would they be prepared to tell him the truth about the fairly disastrous progress of this campaign “I think we are much less certain that he is getting an honest picture on the ground.” Russian setbacks and Ukrainian resistance since Kremlin troops invaded on February  have stunned military experts - and triggered bitter infighting among the Russian hierarchy. Another official said: “I think it’s also likely that within the Russian system ious elements are going to be blaming each other for the lack of success, so that’s going to also complicate the challenge for the truth getting through.  “People will be being quite defensive about their own failures, and, I think, looking to point the finger at others.” Reported retreats by Moscow forces were evidence of “just how badly President Putin has miscalculated”, they added. Kremlin spies were guilty of a “catastrophic” intelligence failure in the run-up to the invasion, according to Western officials. Russians were said to believe that Ukrainians would welcome them over the border. There have also been claims that agents who realised the potential pitfalls of waging war were too scared to tell superiors. An official said: “There’s a lot of self-reflection in the intelligence services that they misjudged catastrophically the Ukrainian national mood. “To the extent that they got it right, they didn’t communicate it properly.”Praising Ukrainian resistance, the official said the war was “creating -it did not exist before - a sense of Ukrainian sacrice and nationhood and an unwillingness to submit to Russia, which will last for generations probably and will make this country impossible to subdue for Russia”. Boris Johnson held phone talks with fellow leaders US President Joe Biden, French Premier Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Italian PM Mario Draghi.A No spokeswoman said they “agreed on the ongoing need to support and sustain the people of Ukraine in their fight against Russian barbarism”. She added: “The Prime Minister underscored that we must judge Putin’s regime by their actions not their words.“Putin is twisting the kne in the open wound of Ukraine in an attempt to force the country and its allies to capitulate.“The Prime Minister stressed to his fellow leaders that we should be unrelenting in our response.”Meanwhile, Western agencies continue to examine claims Cha FC owner Roman Abramovich, who has been sanctioned by the UK Government, was poisoned on a trip to Kyiv where he was helping with peace talks. An official said: “They are obviously extremely concerning allegations. “Let’s just say the Russian system has form in terms of utilising chemical weapons.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Olaf ScholzBoris JohnsonRoman AbramovichEmmanuel MacronJoe BidenVladimir PutinPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Or to be more accurate, I want to beJamie Wallis said: Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. Well, I’m notByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Mar Updated:,  Mar An MP today became the first in British history to announce they are trans, saying: I have never lived my truth and I’m not sure how. Jamie Wallis, the Tory MP for Bridgend in south Wales since , shared the news in a statement in the early hours today. The statement on Dr Wallisapos website said: I’m trans. Or to be more accurate, I want to be. I’ve been diagnosed with gender dysphoria and I’ve felt this way since I was a very young child. I had no intention of ever sharing this with you. I always imagined I would leave politics well before I ever said this out loud. The MP went on: Being an MP and hiding something like this was always going to be tough, but I arrogantly assumed I was up for it. Well, I’m not. Dr Wallis was praised by campaigners and MP colleagues.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who last night made a joke about trans issues in a speech to MPs, tweeted: Sharing this very intimate story would have taken an immense amount of courage. Thank you @JamieWallisMP for your bravery, which will undoubtedly support others.The Conservative Party I lead will always give you, and everyone , the love and support you need to be yourself. Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss wrote: Well done Jamie Wallis for speaking out and your brave statement. We stand with you. Tory party chairman Oliver Dowden said: Proud of my colleague Jamie Wallis. As a Conservative family we stand together, and we will support you. I hope that your brave statement will help others.Conservative Tom Tugendhat said this is a very brave statement, while Labouraposs Angela Eagle tweeted: This is very brave. Look after yourself and take the time you need to recover. Labour MP Chris Bryant wrote: Dear Jamie I wish you all the very best. Colleagues across the House will respect your openness honesty and the journey you are on. Cwtch.Benjamin Cohen, the chief executive of Pink News, added: This is truly groundbreaking, the UK’s first MP to share that they are trans. The LGBT+ Conservatives group tweeted: Asking for help  seeking comfort in those around you isn’t always easy. The group told the MP it was also in your support network - and are always here to support you whenever you need. You’ve always been there for us, now it’s our turn. In the online post Dr Wallis said they had been a victim of separate crimes of blackmail and rape, after which things have really taken a tumble adding: I am not OK. The MP wrote: There was a close call in April  when someone Blackmailed me, outed me to my father and sent photographs to other family members. He wanted £, to keep quiet. The police were so supportive, so understanding and on this occasion the system worked. He pled guilty and was sentenced to yrs and mnths in prison. After describing an incident of rape, the MP went on: I have not been myself since this incident and I don’t think I will ever recover. It is not something you ever forget, and it is not something you ever move on from. Dr Wallis was arrested on suspicion of driving while unfit after colliding into a lamp post in November. In the overnight web statement, the MP wrote: I fled the scene. I did so because I was terried. I have PTSD and I honestly have no idea what I was doing except I was overcome by an overwhelming sense of fear. I am sorry that it appears I aposran awayapos but this isn’t how it happened in the moment.The MP praised the support of colleagues and Conservative whips, after Boris Johnson hosted a dinner for Tory MPs at a London hotel. According to reports, the Prime Minister opened his speech with a joke saying: Good evening ladies and gentleman, or as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth.However, Dr Wallis wrote: Tonight, I was reminded of the incredible support those you work with can provide. Also, I was reminded how important it is to be yourself. I have never lived my truth and I’m not sure how. Perhaps it starts with telling everyone. Trans rights, and how to describe trans people, have become a topic of bitter debate in Westminster.In , ministers scrapped plans to make it easier for trans people to change their legal gender after campaigners raised concerns about biological sex and the preservation of women-only spaces.Trans people still need a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria, evidence they have lived in their assumed gender for two years, agreement from their spouse, and to have their bid approved by a  of medics and judges. Human rights groups and LGBT rights group Stonewall condemned the government for falling far short on its promise of reform. Boris Johnson last week said the issue requires extreme sensitivity, tact, love and care. We must recognise that when people want to make a transition in their lives, they should be treated with the maximum possible generosity and respect. We have systems in this country that allow that and have done for a long time, and we should be very proud of that, but I want to say in addition that I think, when it comes to distinguishing between a man and a woman, the basic facts of biology remain overwhelmingly important.

Dovecot, in Middlesbrough, has applied for planning permission to replace disabled car parking spaces nearby with a new summer house. In the meantime owner Carl Blake is looking to extend the beer garden, but is planning to avoid rowdy drinkers using the premises, Teesside Live reported.He said: “We don’t want the social club crowd that wants cheap beer. “Our cheapest pint is £. so we get rid of that type of clientele, we don’t do Carling, we don’t do Fosters. “I don’t want it to come across as it’s going to be a free for all Oktoberfest-style outdoor area because that’s not what we are looking for. “We are expensive, we are premium, everything we do is premium, so we look for that high-end clientele. That’s what we are looking for.  “We would rather have a couple of ladies who have been shopping in the town and stopping in for a bottle of wine rather than a group of lads on a session. “In this area, we have a lot of places where you can go and get sozzled but we don’t have a lot of places where you can go out as a couple and enjoy it.” The plans to avoid some types of drinkers was not appreciated by some people who suggested in the current economic climate businesses can ill afford to pick and choose. One unhappy social media user said: “£. so we get rid of that type of clientele  “Wow! Just wow, grab what you can this day and age pal ‘cause things about to get a lot lot worse.”  Another added: “Disgusting attitude. “This snob deserves to have no customers. I wouldnapost go there even though I could afford to.” Another said: “He says Middlesbrough needs this, then he doesn’t want that clientele. “He does realise Middlesbrough is a working class town and the majority is ‘that clientele’. “I hope he goes bust, the clown.” Mr Blake has also submitted a licensing application to cover the outdoor space and extend the bar’s opening hours on weeknights so that it can hold late-night private s But the owner had been questioning whether he should be ploughing money into the area following a number of recent break-ins. He added: “We have an awful lot of problems at the minute. “It’s dreadful, we have had two break-ins, a car broken into so even though we are spending money on the area, you are still thinking to yourself, am I doing the right thing ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BeerAlcoholPubs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Conley Thompson went missing on July , , after telling his mother he was going out with friends in Barnsley, South Yorkshire. A search was launched and his body was found the next day in a pipe on the building site in Worsbrough. An engineering firm has pleaded guilty to health and safety breaches after the death.On Tuesday, Howard Civil Engineering, which was responsible for the site, admitted two health and safety breaches. Managing director Michael Howard pleaded guilty on behalf of the Leeds company to breaching regulation  of the ConstructionRegulations  and Section of the Health  Safety at Work etc Act . The company failed to ensure necessary steps were taken to prevent access to the site by unauthorised persons. Andrew McGee, prosecuting on behalf of the Health and Safety Executive, said fencing around the site, which was slap bang in the middle of a residential area, was signicantly substandard.  He told Barnsley Magistratesapos Court: Eitherwasnapost a suitable height or it was non-existent, or, where it did exist, it was poorly maintained. Mr McGee said industry guidance notes many children see construction sites as adventure playgrounds and they should be protected against the dangers even though they may be entering as trespassers. Pictures shown to the court included one of a police officer standing next to perimeter fencing that was nowhere near six-foot high, and another of a health and safety inspector with the fence barely ... up to his chest. Mr McGee said there was clear evidence that both adults and children were frequently and easily gaining access to the site. He told the court one Howard Civil Engineering worker was aware people had been climbing over the fence, getting in, while another remembered kids trying to get on to the site but being chased away. A child previously said Conley had been seen on the cages containing the black pipes and was running across the top of the cages, Mr McGee said.  The boy clearly had a history of going on to the Church View site and it was a location he found tempting to enter, the court heard. Mr McGee said: He was not alone in this amongst the children of this residential area. He added: There is no precise timeline for the events of that day. Despite intensive investigations, there is no evidence of when, how, or,he was not alone, with whom Conley entered the site prior to his death. Mr McGee said a pathologist concluded Conley must have gone into the pipe, designed to house fence posts, with both feet at the same time. The pathologist says itaposs possible he slipped in with both feet while standing on the edge, or he might have lowered himself in - nobody knows, he said. There was no suggestion of foul play, the court heard. Mr McGee said: The company fell far short of the appropriate standard. It failed to have in place perimeter fencing consistent with industry standards. Perimeter barriers were obviously, we say, inadequate and, in some places, non-existent. James Maxwell-Scott, mitigating, said managers at the firm were not aware children had been on the site before the fatal incident.  He said: Conley Thompsonaposs death was a tragedy for his family and friends. The defendant hopes the conclusion of this prosecution will help in some small way to bring an element of closure. District Judge Naomi Redhouse adjourned the case to Sheffield Crown Court for sentencing. At the time of his death, Conleyaposs grandmother Deborah Fraser said she was shell-shocked. She said: As a person, he was a lovely little lad, boisterous, got into anything and everything but his smile could light up a room.

The bride, groom and best man were all arrested after the bride attacked her own mother at the reception in Bathgate, West Lothian, Scotland. The mayhem began when Claire Goodbrand, , violently attacked and injured her mum Cherry-Ann Lindsay, erupting into a large scuffle where the groom and best man weighed in. New husband Eamonn Goodbrand and his brother Kieran, their best man, joined the fracas, viciously assaulting wedding guest David Boyd and leaving him severely injured, a court has heard. The best man also attacked and injured another guest before police arrived to break-up the brawl.Officers took the wedding party trio away in cuffs and were remanded in custody in separate cells before appearing in court, the Daily Record reports.When they were finally released from custody Claire was wearing what appeared to be her going-away outfit while the groom and best man were dressed in prison-issue Primark tracksuits, still wearing their mud-stained wedding shoes. Professional fighter Eamonn, , who was sporting a head injury when he was freed, gave an address in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, as did his -year-old we and his -year-old brother. CCTV footage which reportedly captured the fight spilling out of the wedding venue onto the lawn outside, persuaded the trio’s legal team to negotiate guilty pleas to a reduced number of charges at Livingston Sherf Court. Claire Goodbrand pled guilty on indictment to assault to injury but not guilty to a more serious assault to severe injury. She admitted repeatedly seizing her mother by the hair, punching and kicking her on the head and body, causing her to fall to the ground, before striking her head at The Vue wedding venue at Ballencrieff Toll in West Lothian’s Bathgate Hills. She also admitted punching and kicking her mum Cherry-Ann to the head and body whilst she was on the ground, striking her on the head with a shoe and seizing her by the neck and restricting her breathing.  Eamonn and Kieran both pled guilty to repeatedly punching and kicking David Boyd on the head and body while acting together. The charge states that they caused him to fall to the ground and continued their violent attack as he lay there. They admitted pushing their thumbs into Mr Boyd’s eyes, biting him on the head and body and repeatedly seizing him by the neck and restricting his breathing, all to his severe injury. In addition, Kieran Goodbrand admitted assaulting Garry Brown by punching and kicking him on the head and body to his injury at the reception on  June . A fourth member of the family, -year-old Brendan Goodbrand, had his not guilty pleas to two assault charges accepted by the Crown after his alibi that he had left the venue before trouble broke out turned out to be true. Sherf Martin Edington called for criminal justice social work reports on all three accused before passing sentence. He adjourned the case until  April for information on possible disposals, including social work supervision, unpaid hours of work and restriction of liberty by electronic curfew. Eamonn Goodbrand’s Facebook page reveals that he works as a professional fighter, boxing competitively as a light middleweight. It was reported after the wedding reception that one of the alleged victims lost part of a finger during the attack. The prosecution will narrate the full circumstances when the case calls for sentence.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVWeddingsCCTV footageCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Health Secretary Sajid Javid said that tests will no longer be free for the vast majority of the British public, meaning they will have to paythey want to test under the new plans.But the government announced today that a small number of groups will be able to still access the tests for free. Evensomeone is symptomatic they will no longer be told to test, instead urged to isolate until the symptoms pass. From April , the tests are being massively scaled back as apart of the final stage of the government’s plan to live with Covid. However, some people will still have access even after universal testing ends.  On top of this, the government did specy thata new iant of concern emerges then it could be expanded once more. After Friday, the groups who will still have access to free lateral flow tests, when they are asymptomatic, are: • Patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned healthcare providers • Staff in hospices and adult social care services • A small number of care home visitors who provide personal care • Staff in some prisons and places of detention • Staff in high-risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settingsThen, for people who have symptoms, more groups will still have access to testing whilst symptomatic. This will include: • Certain hospital patients who need access to treatments and ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants. • People who are otherwise eligible for community Covid treatments as they are more vulnerable,• And people discharged from hospitals into care homes and similar settings.During an outbreak accessibility to asymptomatic testing will be expanded further. This will go on to include residential special needs and disability schools, and care home staff and residents. Whilst the above will have access to tests when asymptomatic, there are plans in place to make sure free tests are available for some with Covid symptoms. From now on, people who have symptoms, instead of testing, should try to stay home and avoid contact with other people until any symptoms pass. This includes school children.  Mr Javid said: Thanks to our plan to tackle COVID, we are leading the way in learning to live with the virus. We have made enormous progress but will keep the ability to respond to future threats including potential iants. Vaccines remain our best defence and we are now offering spring boosters to the elderly, care home residents and the most vulnerable - please come forward to protect yourself, your family, and your community. One of the reasons the government withdrew the testing programme, as well as believing the country had progressed past the need for such surveillance, was due to the heavy costs. The government said free testing, tracing and isolation cost more than £. billion over the past two years.

Beryl Murray was writhing in pain said her family who detailed how they watched on as her colour was changing during the wait for medical help at her home in Birmingham.Her right leg had given way while she was moving from her walker into a stairlt on Tuesday afternoon , and she was able to reach for her careline alarm, which notied the ambulance service at .pm. Her son Stephen, , and his we Wendy, , also received the alert and drove  miles from their home in Stonesfield, Oxfordshire to help her. But paramedics didnapost arrive until .am the following morning - more than nine hours after the initial report, which was filed as a category two call.  West Midlands Ambulance Service said the setback was down to hospital handover delays but the Murray family has called the wait time totally unacceptable and said something has to change to prevent a tragedy. Daughter-in-law Wendy said: It was nine hours of her writhing in pain, it was awful to watch. My husband was very distressed seeing his mum like that. Itaposs totally unreasonable that someone of  and in that level of pain should have to endure that for such a long period of time. She lives on her own and we live in Oxford so we drove straight there when we got the call. Thankfully a neighbour was able to get to her before us, but she couldnapost move her leg at all, she was in agony. When we called the ambulance to find out how long they would be, we were warned it could take up to six hours because they were so busy. We called back a few times but it was after .am by the time the ambulance arrived, which is just totally unacceptable. We just tried to make her as comfortable as possible until the ambulance turned up. She was complaining of pain in her lower back so we didnapost dare move her.  Her colour was changing so we were getting really worried. She just kept saying aposIaposm in so much painapos and aposmy leg is hurting so muchapos. We found out from the hospital the next day she had broken her leg, which was a big shock. That made it even worse, knowing the level of pain she must have been in for that long. Above all, something has to change. People could lose their livesit doesnapost. A week on from her fall and Beryl remains in Sandwell Hospital, waiting for an operation on her leg.West Midlands Ambulance Service has issued an apology to Beryl and her family, citing severe pressure facing the NHS. They said the patientaposs condition had not worsened when follow-up calls were received.An ambulance service spokeswoman said: We would like to apologise to Ms Murray and her family for the time it took to reach her. The whole of the NHS remains under severe pressure and unfortunately, hospital handover delays mean some patients are waiting far longer for an ambulance to come to them than we would want. “A paramedic in our control room contacted the patient to check on her condition. The paramedic would have upgraded the call had her condition changed. “We continue to work with local partners to find ways to reduce the delays so that our crews can respond more quickly. Our staff and volunteers continue to work tirelessly to respond as soon as we can.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The operation to transport the Queen from Windsor to Central London began early this morning, when she left her home alongside Prince Andrew in a Land Rover.The Land Rover then made its way to Buckingham Palace, where several well-wishers had gathered to see her arrival at her official residence. Once at the Palace, the Queen swapped cars and left her Land Rover to sit in her Bentley state limousine, which then made the short journey to the Abbey escorted by police outriders.

Once out of the car, she is said to have took Andrewaposs arm as they headed inside while keeping the walking stick in her right hand. The first time she appeared on TV cameras was when she was safely inside the building, and she took part in a short procession. At the end of the aisle, she then let go of her sonaposs hand and made the last few steps to her seat with just her stick. Once the ceremony was over, she ed to the Bentley with Andrew to be driven away from the venue. For the service today, the Queen teamed her dark green coat with a brooch that was also a nod to her strength and stay, who passed away in April last year.She chose her yellow gold, ruby and diamond scarab brooch, designed by Andrew Grima, which was a personal gt from Philip in . Other royal women who also opted to wear the same shade of green were the Duchess of Cornwall and Princess Anne. This is because it is the same hue as the Duke of Edinburghaposs official dark green livery colour, which was known as Edinburgh Green. It was used for his staff liveries – the duke’s page at the coronation wore dark green and silver – and private cars. Others in the congregation also wore dark green, including Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holder Doyin Sonibare, who delivered a special tribute about the effect Philip’s youth scheme had on her le.

Ms Weaver shot to fame in February  when a video of her chairing a bruising online meeting for Handforth Parish Council, now called Handforth Town Council, in Cheshire went viral.The leaked video showed her trying to referee the chaotic gathering and sparking even more unrest when she ejected the chairman after he challenged her “authority”. Six reports produced by an external investigator have now been published by Cheshire East Council, investigating the behaviour of councillors involved in the incident. The reports said that while Ms Weaver’s actions were without “any formal footing in terms of appropriate process and procedure”, it was understood “why Jackie Weaver acted as she did”. Ms Weaver emerged as the unlikely hero of the unruly meeting, which was held on December  in  to discuss local planning and environment issues but didn’t surface until early last year.  She kicked three members out of the meeting, including the chairman, when tempers flared - prompting some to describe the car crash assembly as British comedy gold. Celebrities including Richard Osman and Steph McGovern were among those sharing the link to the video recording of the meeting. The meeting was the second time chair Brian Tolver had been removed, having previously been evicted from the earlier pm Planning and Environment Committee. The .pm meeting began with an unseen councillor mumbling f*** off under their breath. Mr Tolver then refused to recognise the legitimacy of both meetings. He also told Ms Weaver, from the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, to stop talking and you have no authority here.  In response, Ms Weaver removed Mr Tolver from the Zoom call and placed him in a virtual waiting room.The clips were a hit with Twitter users, with thousands of retweets and likes and had also been posted on YouTube, where it had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The six reports probing the behaviour of councillors, total  pages, The BBC reports.Three reports look into complaints laid prior to the meetings while the other three look at behaviour in that meeting. According to one, Ms Weaver was “not acting in an official capacity at these meetings. However, it was acknowledged that Ms Weaver believed her actions were necessary, given the behaviour of some of the councillors. Faced with what were unusual and dficult circumstances, and the deep-seated issues underpinning those circumstances, we can understand why Jackie Weaver acted as she did, despite her action being without any formal footing in terms of appropriate process and procedure,” one report read.  Reacting to the reports, Ms Weaver said she welcomed the findings but was “deeply saddened” that it took “so long and cost so much” to get there. She said it was still very vague as to how virtual council meetings worked. In her opinion, she added, she had not actually removed her fellow council members from the meeting, but rather had moved them to the waiting room. A little later in the meeting the remaining councillors voted to remove them,” she added. The reports also noted that three former councillors were “on the balance of probability” in some breaches of the Code of Conduct for members. These so-called breaches referred to both long-standing issues at the council and the viral Zoom meeting. Another report said three current councillors were not in breach of the code, although their behaviour “cannot be said to be exemplary. The reports have been published after Cheshire East Council has decided to release them. Due to the three councillors under investigation having resigned, there were no formal findings made, as the reports did not make it to the committee stage of the process. The reports were published after councillors at Cheshire East Council decided to release them. The former councillors had made a statement, claiming they did not accept the findings of the six reports and “do not recognise any of them as being valid. The statement went on to claim the findings equated to “extreme fiction”. The trio planned to contest the findings. John Smith, the chairman of Handforth Town Council, congratulated Cheshire East Council legal officers for carrying out the investigation. Handforth Town Council is now getting on with supporting our great community, quietly and I hope, unobtrusively,” he said. Earlier this year it was revealed that the rows have cost Cheshire East Council more than £,. A council spokesman said: While the early stages of complaint investigation are confidential, once a final investigation report has been issued, there is a strong public interest in the disclosure of findings on conduct matters regarding holders of public office.” This was especially so when the alleged conduct was serious in nature, he said, and occurred within the public domain.

They walked into Westminster Abbey with their parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge before taking their seats in the row behind the Queen and Prince Charles. The eight-year-old future king and his six-year-old sister looked slightly nervous when they got out of the car and walked towards the building, however some reassuring words from mum Kate saw Charlotte start smiling.According to lip reader Jacqui Press, Kate whispered to a very serious and nervous looking Charlotte, you can smile, reports MailOnline. The princess, who was holding her mumaposs hand, then breaks into a big smile. Meanwhile Prince William held Georgeaposs hand and gave him some instructions, saying: Letaposs go in. He then guides his son towards the dignitaries and introduces them. The youngsters shook hands with the clergy who bent down to speak to them, with Charlotte giving a large grin. George matched his dad in a dark blue suit and a spotted tie, while Charlotte looked smart in a navy coat with a blue ribbon in her hair. George – who will one day be monarch – and Charlotte’s appearance marks a key moment in their public lives, being the first major televised church service they have attended.In line with the order of seniority, the Cambridge family left the abbey after the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla but before the rest of the royal family. As Charlotte walked past her second cousin Mia, the daughter of Zara and Mike Tindall, the little girls shared an excited wave. George and Charlotte have appeared on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping the Colour and joined their parents on official tours when younger, but this is the first time they have taken part in an event on this scale. Westminster Abbey is a focal point for royal celebrations, coronations, commemorations and funerals, and is likely to serve as such for the siblings in the future.The gothic church in central London is where their parents married, and where William said his final farewell to his mother – who George and Charlotte refer to as “Granny Diana” – when he was . Also at the memorial were Peter Phillips’ children, Savannah, , and eight-year-old Isla, who were sitting next to their cousin Mia. The girls were dressed in navy with their hair fixed back with headbands. The Queen and Philip had a large brood of great-grandchildren, but a number are still babies. The couple’s  great-grandchildren are Savannah, Isla, George, Mia, Charlotte, Prince Louis, Lena Tindall, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, August Brooksbank, Lucas Tindall, Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor, and Sienna Mapelli Mozzi. August and Lucas both have Philip as a middle name in honour of their great-grandfather. Lili and Sienna were born in the months following Philip’s death. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have remained in the US, where they live with two-year-old Archie and nine-month-old Lili, rather than travelling back for the service.

His mum Rita recalled the awful moment she sat with her son at his bedside when he took his last breath and said the family are left devastated.He was the kindest lad you could ever wish to meet. We loved him, she told Manchester Evening News.He was the perfect dad and did everything he could for his daughters. He was so funny and had so many friends. I miss him terribly. Mark discovered a lump in his stomach while training for a marathon in December and initially thought he may have developed a hernia. But he then became increasingly tired and began experiencing pains in his back and the side of his body.  After a series of scans, doctors confirmed the lump to be kidney cancer and told Mark he had just months to live. In February, he learned that the cancer was already so advanced it was aposincurableapos and put his hopes on treatment options that would allow him to live long enough to spend Christmas with his family. But he took a turn for the worse and was admitted to Salford Royal Hospital where he passed away last Tuesday. Markaposs friend John Davies described him as a fighter until the end. His mum Rita praised the nurses at the hospital for the support they gave to her son in his final days. They were the nicest nurses you could ever wish for. They treated us like royalty, she said.Following Markaposs death, dozens of people have taken to Twitter to pay tribute to him.Nichola Morris said: Cancer has cruelly stolen another one from us far too young and too soon. It always takes the good ones. The heartbreak across Stretford and Urmston this morning is enormous. You were so loved by so many and will leave a massive gap. RIP Jonesy. You were one of the best. Mark tied the knot with his partner Sarah in a short ceremony at their family home after his diagnosis. They were joined by loved ones with the coupleaposs daughters acting as ring bearers for the big occasion. A group of Markaposs closest friends raised more than £, for Macmillan Cancer Support by walking the Manchester Marathon earlier this month. Manchester United legend Roy Keane was among those who made a donation in Markaposs honour.The football player even visited Mark, a Manchester United fan, at his home less than two weeks before his death.

Leboat volunteers, coastguard officers and members of the public raced to save the vehicle.

Llandudnoaposs inshore leboat Dr Barbara Saunderson was taken away from a training exercise in Llandudno Bay when the alarm was raised. The leboat team was called in to assist the coastguard after the vehicle became submerged in the water due to the tide.  The vehicle was at Porth Eirias, Colwyn Bay, when the tide came in. The incoming tide submerged the car despite the best efforts from the leboat crew and the coastguard team. RNLI crew member Luke Heritage said: Regrettably we could not achieve a recovery but did leave a marker buoy as a navigational aid for a submerged hazard. It is unclear who the unlucky owner is, but no injuries were reported. In , an unlucky motorist was left helpless when their car got stuck in sand at a Welsh beauty spot and was submerged by the tide.The white people carrier was stranded but could not be recovered until Sunday when the tide went out again. The car had parked on the sands on the beach at Cemaes, a village on the north coast of Anglesey in Wales but the fast-moving tide caught out the driver.  A Jeep tried to help the car as the tide came in - however, it also got stuck, reports the Daily Post.A passing canoeist was able to get this picture of the stricken vehicle. A tractor was able to save the Jeep but the white people carrier, complete with the sunroof open, was lost to the sea. It was stuck overnight in the middle of the bay.

Free testing for the general public ends on Friday as part of the Living with Covid plan which last month set out the government’s strategy to live with and manage the virus.From  April, updated guidance will advise people with symptoms of a respiratory infection, including Covid-, and a high temperature or who feel unwell, to try stay at home and avoid contact with other people, until they feel well enough to resume normal activities and they no longer have a high temperature, the Department of Health and Social Care says.Until this date, people should continue to follow the current guidance. Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should also stay at home and avoid contact with other people, where they can. They can go back to school, college or childcare when they no longer have a high temperature, and they are well enough to attend.  From April , anyone with a positive Covid- test result will be advised to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for  days, which is when they are most infectious. Advice will be provided for iniduals who need to leave their home when they have symptoms or have tested positive, including avoiding close contact with people with a weakened immune system, wearing a face-covering and avoiding crowded places. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: As we learn to live with Covid, we are focusing our testing provision on those at higher risk of serious outcomes from the virus, while encouraging people to keep following simple steps to help keep themselves and others safe. The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. Covid still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from othersyou have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including Covid.  Vaccination remains the best way to protect us all from severe disease and hospitalisation due to Covid infection. If you have not yet come forward for your primary or booster I would urge you to do so straight away – the NHS vaccine programme is there to help you and the sooner you are vaccinated the sooner you and your family and friends will be protected.Under the plans set out free symptomatic testing will be provided for: Patients in hospital, where a PCR test is required for their care and to provide access to treatments and to support ongoing clinical surveillance for new iants People who are eligible for community Covid- treatments because they are at higher risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-. People in this group will be contacted directly and sent lateral flow tests to keep at home for usethey have symptoms as well as being told how to reorder tests People living or working in some high-risk settings. For example, staff in adult social care services such as homecare organisations and care homes, and residents in care homes and extra care and supported living services, NHS workers and those working and living in hospices, and prisons and places of detention , where infection needs to be identied quickly to minimise outbreaks. People will also be tested before being discharged from hospital into care homes, hospices, homelessness settings and domestic abuse refuges. Asymptomatic lateral flow testing will continue from April in some high-risk settings where infection can spread rapidly while prevalence is high. This includes patient-facing staff in the NHS and NHS-commissioned Independent Healthcare Providers, staff in hospices and adult social care services, such as homecare organisations and care homes, a small number of care home visitors who provide personal care, staff in some prisons and places of detention and in high risk domestic abuse refuges and homelessness settings.Testing will be provided for residential SEND, care home staff and residents during an outbreak and for care home residents upon admission. This also includes some staff in prisons and immigration removal centres.

But her warmth appeared not to be shared by other royals, said body language expert Judi James, who claimed that they “pretended to not even see him”.Only Prince Harry and Meghan Markle of the senior royals were not at the service that were attended also by friends and people who benefitted from his charities and patronages. With around , people attending the thanksgiving event it was a very dferent scene to Philip’s funeral last year that was held with minimal mourners due to Covid restrictions. Andrew took his seat next to Edward in the front row at the church after escorting the Queen.Ms James told the Daily Mail: “Taking his place next to Edward he cut an isolated but defiant-looking figure, but there were no glances or even nods of greeting and no discernible eye contact. The eye-avoidance looked deliberate, with most of the Firm staring pointedly ahead as though barely even aware of him.”She pointed out how Edward and Sophie have been used by the Royal Family as buffers on other occasions but there was no “warmth” this time.  And she honed in on the closeness of the relationship that the Queen has with Andrew. The message from the Queen about her prodigal son Andrew looked unequivocal today. As her eldest son Charles is fond of saying, this is now clearly a aposnon-negotiableapos relationship, said Ms James. Not only did she choose her second son to accompany and support her as she walked into the Abbey, making this the first time she has been seen in public accepting assistance from anyone, she also paused before they parted to take their seats and threw him a smile of thanks in front of UK and foreign royalty as well as the eyes of the rest of the world. The body language expert also felt that there was a non-verbal arrogance from Andrew which she picked up by the wave that he gave to photographers. Andrewaposs bearing was upright and almost military. Those spectacles perched on the end of his nose suggested his tendency to non-verbal arrogance is still holding firm, while his wave to the cameras could be seen as something of a victory role, Ms James added.

He has let the Queen down once again, says Polly HudsonThe Duke of York, right, with his late father Prince Philip and mother Queen Elizabeth Image: Getty ImagesopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Mar |comments It doesn’t feel that controversial an opinion to say that I never want to see Prince Andrew again.Hard not to assume that most people feel the same way. So it seems impossible that Andrew, and those around him, aren’t aware of that. They must know exactly how popular he is, and that there is nothing that will ever change that.Of course Andrew is entitled to go to a memorial service for his father – but it is utterly tone deaf of him not to have read the room. He clearly should have slipped into the building quietly, sat somewhere discreet, tried to be as invisible as possible. To instead arrogantly rock up front and centre stage, even travelling in a car with the star of the show, is appalling behaviour, even by his standards.If his mother needed assistance on the journey, and down the aisle, there are plenty of other family members who could – who should – have been by her side instead.Andrew has let the poor Queen down, yet again, on what was already a testing day for many reasons. He shouldn’t have put her in that position, he should have insisted on travelling alone, being seated separately, definitely not in the front row, of all places.Sitting smugly in the hot seat makes it seem like he doesn’t understand the seriousness of what has happened, the cloud over him that will never go away – or that he simply doesn’t care. In reality it’s hardly a shock that Andrew hasn’t done the right thing –he was man of honour and integrity he would have nothing to apologise for. Which, let’s never forget, he never has. Palace insiders believe that after today he will effectively disappear from public le. Good riddance. Don’t let the palace door hit you on the way out.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgePrince GeorgePrincess CharlottePrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkRoyal FamilyThe Queen\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Richard Grfin, who was responsible for the safety of both the Queen and Prince Philip for  years, was a guest at todayaposs event but was disappointed the Duke and Duchess of Sussex decided against ing to the UK to pay their respects.Harry has said heaposs unable toto the UK due to safety concerns, which have become the subject of his latest legal battle - this time against the Home Office. Speaking to Sky News, Richard said: William had a great training from [Prince Philip] and is going to learn all his examples for him. Fingers crossed, I just hope Harry gets some of these things into his mind.Asked about his decision not to attend, he said: That was a big disappointment for everybody. He also said that members of the ,-strong congregation were discussing Harryaposs absence before the service began. He said: Certainly around where I was they thought he should have been here. All this nonsense about he couldnapost get protection, as far as Iaposm concerned that was a pathetic excuse, he should have been here to honour his grandfather. At the end of the day,he was that worried about security he could have stuck with his brother and father who have got wonderful security. He would have been more than safe.Richard worked for the royal family for over a decade and said todayaposs service captured the Duke perfectly. Speaking about todayaposs event, he said: To see the Queen come in and sit with her family, that was wonderful.It was very emotional. I worked with Prince Philip for  years and travelled the world with him, I did a lot of things with him and deeply missed him when he died.Prince Philip had a big footprint on the service, you could see it right the way through. It was fantastic to be able to come today and pay our respects. It was a wonderful, wonderful service. He was the most caring man you could possibly meet.  He also shared a story about when his son was diagnosed with cancer and Philip called the hospital to check on him. He also wrote to his we to check on her and on another occassion arranged transport so Mr Grfinaposs daughter could make it home Christmas. Todayaposs event paid tribute to Prince Philipaposs charity work and decades of service to the Queen and the royal family. The Dean of Westminster delivered a moving speech about the Duke. He said: He would hate to think that I should paint a picture of him as a ‘plaster saint’ someone without the usual human foibles and failings. He was far too self-aware ever to be taken in by flattery. Of course, it must be said that his le bore the marks of sacrice and service.  Certainly, he could show great sympathy and kindness. There is no doubt that he had a delightfully engaging, and often self-deprecating, sense of humour. It is quite clear that his mind held together both speculation and common sense. Moreover, nobody would ever doubt his loyalty and deep devotion to our Queen and to their family. Yet, there were times when he could be abrupt maybe, in robust conversation, forgetting just how intimidating he could be. A kind of natural reserve sometimes made him seem a little distant. He could be somewhat sharp in pricking what he thought to be bubbles of pomposity or sycophancy. On the other hand, we should not forget that he himself was sometimes wounded by being unfairly criticised or misunderstood. Like the rest of us, he was part of flawed humanity. Unlike most of us however, he was one of those rare people who remained true to, and guided by, what you might call ‘an inner spiritual compass’ a sense of being called to play a part in the making of a God-intended world. As we give thanks for the le of a remarkable man, perhaps out greatest tribute to him, most especially in these far too troubled times, will be for us to accept the challenge, implicit in his le, to rekindle in our hearts something of that call, and to prayfor the inspiration and the guidance to play our part, however small, in working for a kinder future.

And an adorable moment was spotted between Charlotte and Beatrice as the congregation sang a hymn earlier today.Footage shows that as Charlotte gazed around the huge building as the congregation sang, the young princess caught the eye of Beatrice behind her.

As Charlotte left the service alongside her parents William and Kate, Zara could be seen pointing out the young princess to Mia, who was sat beside her. And as they passed each other, Mia gave her younger relative a huge wave as they left the service. Charlotte, Mia and their siblings have all been pictured together at events in the past with Prince William seemingly having a close relationship with his cousin Zara.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation. After the disastrous royal colonial relic tour of the Caribbean, the head of the creaking institution also undermined a family business suddenly feeling very out of date.

And according to royal author and former BBC royal correspondent Jennie Bond, the Queen was loyal to her much-loved husband right until the end - and beyond. She told the Mirror: It was the very essence of her. Stalwart, dignied and loyal to her beloved husband to the very end — and beyond. This was an occasion the Queen had been determined to attend, despite her growing problems with mobility. If our hearts went out to her when she sat alone at the Duke’s funeral because of Covid rules, it was surely equally poignant to see her battle her frailty to give public thanks for his le. It was a question of mind over matter — and probably a considerable level of discomfort — for her to make the journey from Windsor Castle, where she now lives permanently, to London. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up .Almost  years since she walked down the long aisle of Westminster Abbey to become his we, she took the shorter route, through a side door, to honour the man who had won her heart when she was just a teenager. She walked with a stick and, in a highly signicant show of support for her beleaguered son, Prince Andrew, she held his arm for added stability. Her shoulders now are stooped, her back probably painful, but this was a day more important to her than any other. The decision about whether she would be able to make it to the Abbey was not made until the last moment. Even a couple of hours before the service, the Palace would only say that the Queen aposintended to attendapos.  She is a proud woman and does not want to be seen in a wheelchair. This may, though, become inevitable. After rummaging in her handbag, she found her glasses, opened the order of service and instead of sitting down, as might have been expected, she stood at the head of her family. Quiet and solemn. Meanwhile, Jennie says it has been tough few months for the Queen - but today she took her rightful place in the Abbey alongside royalty from across the world.  She added: In the year since his death the Queen has shown extraordinary fortitude, attending as many engagements as she could after the Covid lockdown ended. So many, in fact, that she was ordered to rest by her doctors. There was an overnight stay in hospital and tests to ascertainthere were underlying problems. She was forced to miss some of the most important events in her calendar: the Remembrance Service at the Cenotaph and the Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey. And, gradually, we all became used to her conducting her meetings via video calls. In February, at one of her rare face to face meetings, she stood to greet two senior military officers but said: aposAs you can see, I can’t move!apos If that wasn’t bad enough, she then caught Covid. And, of course, she has had to confront the allegations made against Prince Andrew and strip him of his royal patronages and military appointments. It has not been an easy year for our  year old monarch. Today, though, we saw her take her rightful place amongst her extended family, Kings and Queens of Europe, and hundreds of people who shared her love and respect for the man she called aposher strength and stayapos.

It was used for his staff liveries – the duke’s page at the coronation wore dark green and silver – and private cars. Others in the congregation also wore dark green, including Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award holder Doyin Sonibare, who delivered a special tribute about the effect Philip’s youth scheme had on her le.  The Queen teamed her dark green coat with a brooch that was also a nod to her strength and stay, who passed away in April last year. She chose her yellow gold, ruby and diamond scarab brooch, designed by Andrew Grima, which was a personal gt from Philip in . Camilla wore her Rles brooch in recognition of the moment when her father-in-law handed over his role as colonel-in-chief of the regiment to her in .Meanwhile members of the late royalaposs staff wore matching green and white striped ties, which was designed by the Duke for his employees to wear while in his service. Speaking to Sky News, his former personal protection officer Richard Grfin explained: This this is a tie Prince Philip designed so anyone who worked for his personal household, this is the tie they all wore. When the service came out weaposve all been going through our wardrobes trying to find this tie. However not all guests opted for green, with many of the younger royal women deciding to dress in green. The Duchess of Cambridge wore for a high-necked black dress with white polka dots and a textured wide-brimmed black hat. Sophie Wessex and Philipaposs granddaughter Princess Beatrice, who burst into tears during the moving ceremony, also went for black outfits for the occasion. Prince George matched his dad in a smart blue suit and tie, while Princess Charlotte and her second-cousin Mia Tindal wore formal navy coats.

For a moment, uncharacteristically, she simply looked deflated, defeated. Behind closed doors, there must have been moments she felt exactly this.The Queen battled ill health and mobility issues to be there for Prince Philip, using every ounce of energy and sheer will she could muster to say a final goodbye to the love of her le.The man she called her devoted “strength and stay”, the husband who supported her, without complaint, always a step behind, for  years.But it was her decision to have shamed Prince Andrew by her side at the service of thanksgiving for the Duke of Edinburgh that provoked astonishment and shock. Despite withdrawing from public le and just three weeks after paying suspected millions to settle a civil sexual assault case, Prince Andrew took the limelight at the service in Westminster Abbey. While some have suggested the Queen’s decision may have been purely practical, or simply a mother’s natural wish for comfort on a dficult day from her favourite son, it was hard not to see it as an endorsement. He, of course, has not admitted wrongdoing, but his attitude and treatment of his accuser has been widely condemned. It was left unconfirmed until the morning whether the monarch would attend, nearly a year on from the Duke’s strictly reduced Covid-secure funeral last April.  When she did arrive, it was through a side door near Poets’ Corner, walking a short distance holding the elbow of her disgraced son with her left hand. Using a cane as the ,-strong congregation sang Monk’s Gate, she then left Andrew’s side to make her own way with a slight smile, gingerly, to her seat, padded with an extra cushion. The moment proved overwhelming for her granddaughter, Princess Beatrice. The mum-of-one, , was unable to hold back tears. Stripped of his titles, this is believed to have been Andrew’s final official outing as a serving royal.  He was in a front-row seat next to his younger brother the Earl of Wessex. The Queen was seated next to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall. Abuse survivors reacted with anger at Andrew’s prominence, and the Queen’s apparent support. Sammy Woodhouse, a victim of the Rotherham child sexual exploitation scandal, said: “There is no thought whatsoever for survivors here.”  The -minute service gave thanks for the le and work of the Duke, who died aged  at Windsor with the Queen by his side on April .Also there were the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Leader of the Opposition Keir Starmer and royals including Prince Albert of Monaco, Denmark’s Queen Margrethe, King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, and Spain’s King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The QueenPrince Philip, Duke of EdinburghDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In one photo, overgrown moss and other shrubbery can be seen flooding the inside of a once busy chapel as the structure begins to crumble.In another shot, mummied bodies can be seen among a pile of bones and skeletons. Another haunting photo shows a derelict church, which features torn wallpaper and dusty flooring, along with broken stained-glass windows and a worn podium. Other photos show some churches intact, with one featuring a structure of Jesus on the cross hanging above a podium, with bright stained-glass windows allowing sunlight to shine through. Across the  photos, there is destroyed historic artwork, rusted statues of important religious events and decaying chairs which would have once seated those overseeing ceremonies.Roman said: “Today, these abandoned churches offer a unique glimpse into the past as a source of reflection. “These are the traces of the past of many communities andwe follow them, we can see where we all came from and perhaps where we’re going.” He added: “Every little town in Italy has at least a chapel – even the small town of Chianche which isn’t on most maps has two. As some of these churches are highly regarded as national treasures, some have been well-maintained in pristine condition. However, this isnapost the case for the majority of them.Roman said: “Others meet a rather dferent ending, being left in the hands of time and its relentless way of decaying things. “Italy is a perfect example of a country that although greatly valuing its history, architecture, culture and connection with the church, still features its share of abandoned churches. “In some cases, abandoned churches and religious buildings might not even be known outside of a specic neighbourhood. “As time goes by, the knowledge of these places and their past history gets simply lost through time.

Movements of planes used by top Kremlin officials show that Putin could be spending some or all of his time at the hideaway near Surgut in western Siberia, it is claimed.His defence minister Sergei Shoigu is believed to be in a bunker near Ufa in the Urals,  miles east of Moscow, said investigative journalist Christo Grozev. Shoigu has been mysteriously absent for several weeks sparking rumours about his health. The theory of his whereabouts is backed by his daughter Ksenia Shoigu, , who was pictured in Ufa for perhaps three days from March . Ms Shoigu visited the Russian city as speculation was re that the defence minister had suffered heart problems. She also abruptly barred public access to her Instagram where she had posed with her baby in the blue and yellow colours of Ukraine.The use of the high security bunkers,confirmed, is alarming and suggests Putin may be preparing to deploy nuclear weapons, and move that would lead to inevitable reprisal. Grozev, who has links to British investigative outlet Bellingcat, said: “I am absolutely sure that Shoigu is in a bunker. “Tracking the movement of his plane, we see very frequent flights to Ufa.  “Knowing that there are also protected bunkers in this region, this gives an obvious answer about his place of residence.” In an interview with Ukraine- channel, he told TV anchor Yevgeny Kiselyov: “This is our very justied version. “I believe in it, and I consider it to be a purely analytical conclusion. “There can’t be any other conclusion. “If the Kremlin’s war strategy assumes a nuclear strike - and it does - as [Dmitry] Peskov [Putin’s spokesman] himself said on CNN a couple of days ago, then there cannot be any other version. “If there is a decision of a potential nuclear strike, they can’t hide the military leadership afterwards. “They have to be hidden beforehand.  “I am absolutely certain he is in a so-called bunker, and by trailing the plane he usually flies, we see very frequent, almost daily flights to Ufa. “Knowing this region has those very protected bunkers this leads us to the obvious conclusion. “ He believed Putin had another bunker where. “Most likely he is where, because we are seeing other flights, and they are more classied than the flight that goes to Ufa. “These are state planes, and they switch off their transponders somewhere around Surgut.”This is Russia ’s oil capital and is some , miles northeast of Moscow.“It looks like the final phase is quite secretive, and most likely there is a more elite bunker there, with the elite of the government.” Previously there have been claims Putin had moved his close relatives to a bunker in the Altai Mountains, some , miles southeast of Surgut and , miles east of Moscow. Grozev also suggested that Russia’s Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov, is operating from a bunker. Coincidentally, the defence minister’s daughter Ksenia Shoigu seems to have been in Ufa for between  and  March. “Today we are in Ufa, on a working visit,” she posted on her Telegram channel on  March. Local newspapers reported that the financier was visiting “at the personal invitation of the head of region on  and  March”. She is president of the Russian Triathlon Federation, and promotes a charity called the Hero League. She visited the Patriot military-patriotic park under construction near Ufa. One theory is that Putin took time out in the pandemic in November or December  when he visited Sarov and laster Tobolsk - which is several hundred miles from Surgut - to inspect emergency bunkers.

From Knapdale, they headed up the west coast, sailing to Lewis and Harris before arriving at their final destination, Iona.Covering almost , miles in the series, they visit places of worship, from pagan stones to an early Christian cave and a contemporary mosque and Sikh temple. The journey tests the pilgrims not just spiritually, but physically too.TV celeb and comedian Scarlett Moffatt, , said: #At school, I spent a lot of time just reading books and on my own and so that’s how I got into faith really. It just felt calming. There’s almost a stigma attached to sort of being religious.#Whenever I would tell my friends, they’d laugh and I’d be like, #why is that funny # I believe in God, there has to be something that started all this.#I would describe myself as Christian, but not a strict Christian. I don’t go to church, but I definitely believe and religion to me is security.#She added: #In my head somebody on a pilgrimage is in a loin cloth and they have really long hair#and they look a bit dehydrated like they need a good moisturiser mask.#I’m doing the pilgrimage as I want to know what my religion is. I want to be able to answer that question with confidence.#TV personality and interior designer Laurence Lewellyn-Bowen describes himself as a #non-conforming pagan#. The -year-old explained: #I think pilgrimage is about clearing out your mental closet by physical exertion and by spiritual conversation with yourself or,you believe it, then conversation with your God.#I know I come across as all sort of flouncy and floppy and rather cavalier, but I am capable of existing in the real world.#However, I don’t think I’ve walked so far not wearing Cuban heels.#Pilgrimage: The Road to the Scottish Isles will be screened on BBC Two and iPlayer in the spring with three one-hour-long episodes, and is a CTVC production."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 18 2021 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 2 3 2 3 2 2 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.It is getting no easier to plan and oversee public works these days.Council staff are to be congratulated for keeping the ious Mid Argyll projects broadly on track in the face of sharply rising costs and many other issues.We now look forward to the ious projects # and the Tarbert Harbour Authority scheme # coming to fruition.The generosity of Argyll folk in responding to the crisis in Ukraine is remarkable, yet not surprising.

victory over the Aberdour seconds across in Fe.Taking advantage of the wind at Silversands, Kilmory pushed ahead with two well-taken quickfire goals from Alex Cunningham on  and  minutes to take an interval lead.There was no more scoring in the second half with both teams struggling a bit on the  sticky pitch.With Inveraray seniors# Mowi National Division match against Skye called off due to heavy rain # after the Aray lads had reached Fort William # Inveraray juniors had the option of a strong bench for their Mowi South Division Two match versus newly-formed Strachur-Dunoon.The match was reversed from the Winterton to Dunoon Stadium with the more experienced Inveraray side running out - winners.Experience aside, the Inveraray side still contained five players under  and one -year-old.A competitive and hard-fought game started at a good pace with Strachur-Dunoon showing good hitting and a willingness to chase down balls.Inveraray struggled for cohesion and had to wait until the th minute to find the breakthrough, Allan MacDonald scoring with a shot from distance.This settled the visitors and in the nd minute after some hard work by Ryan Pugh, the ball broke to Ewan Donnan, who struck from the angle to find the net.No sooner had the dust settled than Inveraray found themselves three ahead when Craig Taylor found space to put the ball past Dunoon keeper Nathan Ross.The second half was a closely-fought affair with both teams playing good, clean shinty.Inveraray had to step up a few gears to keep Strachur-Dunoon at bay, bringing on Colin Campbell, John MacKenzie and Allan Cameron to ensure composure throughout the team.Good second-half performances from all the Inveraray youngsters ensured the game was safe before Inveraray#s Allan Cameron finished the scoring in the th minute.This was the first competitive match for Strachur-Dunoon, and with a number of players missing # others having not met before the game # they showed plenty of determination, which bodes well for the future.Kyles Athletic#s away tie with Kilmallie in the Mowi Premiership was a Saturday morning postponement.The Kilmallie squad had already planned to attend the funeral of club chieftain Hugh #Shep# MacIntyre ahead of the game as the club paid their respects to one of their stalwarts.In Mowi South Division One, Kyles Athletic juniors drew -

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll boosts oban ahead of slockavullin final","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA group of five young Mid Argyll rugby players were in action last weekend as part of Oban Lorne under-s in the semi final of the West Youth Shield.The result of the match on Sunday March  didn#t go their way, as opponents East Kilbride ran out  #  winners, but it was a good contest and close game until Oban players sustained a few injuries and East Kilbride scored a couple of breakaway tries.Oban Lorne and the Mid Argyll contingent # Rhys Coffield, Murray MacDonald, Vinnie Buckley, James Campbell and Sorley Self # have had a great season, winning their West under- development league, so there is plenty for the lads to be proud of.If anyone would like to enjoy some rugby this weekend, Mid Argyll under- boys will be playing on Saturday March  in the final of the West Youth Chairman#s Trophy against Kilmarnock RFC at Slockavullin.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

We ran a local action plan to deal with this, resulting in a number of youths being taken home, tobacco and alcohol being confiscated and fixed penalty notices being issued.#In the coming months new CCTV systems are due to be installed in both Hermitage Park and Churchill Square which should act as a deterrent in these two sometimes problematic locations.#Road crime and road safety continues to be the focus of a large part of our operational activity.

Also standing by was the steamer Brora, which was bund for Belfast.The conditions were so bad from the point of view of visibility that the leboat had to receive bearings from the Brora and other ships by means of the Aldis signal lamps while ships’ searchlights assisted them in getting into position. For a time the ships could only see each other on the radar screen.Coxswain Duncan Newlands, who knows this dreaded part of the estuary like the back of his hand, edged his leboat in astern of the coaster and proceeded to begin operations, but at .am came this dramatic message over the leboat’s radio: ‘Arrived alongside casualty at .hours got rope aboard and commenced towing at . hours.‘Rope now parted. Returning alongside St Kentigern for further instructions.’There was a lull in the activities while the leboat resumed its operations. They tried again- without success.Then came the news at . hours – ‘St Kentigern Refloated.’The leboat has succeeded in its third attempt, against odds.The St Kentigern then proceeded to Campbeltown under her own power, while the leboat escorted her, but first it took in tow the coaster’s own leboat, which it had earlier lowered over the port side in case of an emergency.The Ardchattern also accompanied the Saint Kentigern to Campbeltown.Meantime, the two remaining ships, Lairdsdale and Brora, seeing their attendance was no longer required, sent a parting signal of good-luck to the coaster and continued on their respective passages to towards the Irish Coast."},{"url":null,"title":"leader march 11 2022 2","story":"So the Scottish Government remains adamant in its decision to ban creelers from the Clyde for the next two months or so.We#re not talking North Sea trawlers here that can go where in the interim.

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous. Duplicity#s original meaning in English has to do with a kind of deception in which true feelings or intentions are hidden behind  words or actions.I wouldn’t blame the children of South Sudanthey just gave up.One third are suffering chronic malnutrition.

Our approach in the charter very much aligns with the Scottish Government’s planning legislation.#It is not intended to be a punishment – it recognises that development is capable of gaining consent and being brought under control.#But where we have developments which are unacceptable, we would expect to act with the power that is required.#Councillor Colville then asked: #Is there any indication of officer time which is taken up  Is this a drain on our resources #Mr Bain responded: #It can be. We have an underlying enforcement caseload, as there are minor breaches of control which take an element of officers’ time, to take retrospective applications and serve notices.#We have a resource of two full-time officers and we are facilitating enforcement by drawing on planning officer time.#When we get signicant breaches of control, that will give rise to resources we don’t have on hand. We need to ert resources to deal with them because they are time-critical to deal with the parties involved.#The charter, circulated in advance of the meeting, states: #Planning permission is required for most development that takes place in Scotland, with the exception of some minor works.#However, developers or householders sometimes undertake work without planning permission or fail to comply with the terms of planning permissions.#The purpose of planning enforcement is to resolve a problem rather than to punish a mistake. Any action taken has to be appropriate to the scale of the breach.#Councils have discretionary powers to enforce planning controls in such cases,they consider it is in the public interest and expedient to do so having regard to a deemed assessment against the Local Development Plan and material planning considerations.#Councils also monitor certain developments to ensure planning controls are being followed.

Behind her just happened to be a huge projection of a Saltire and the words \"Queen of Scots\".That was \"peak Sturgeon\".

In the middle of the meeting a man entered from an adjacent officewho made an ill-informed comment about our estimate. After a minutes thought I closed my file and said: “You know what, guys, I’d love the job but I’ll leave you to it and withdraw our offer” to much jaw-dropping.Where was Jim McColl at the point of award of the Scottish ferries  What was his company’s thinking in accepting a contract it had no chance of fulfilling  Perhaps prominently on the bandwagon of delight that a Scottish firm was going to build Scottish ships and now blaming everyone but themselves for this fiasco.There should be an inquiry but all aspects must be looked at, not just the politicians who, historically, have neither the experience nor understanding to award such contracts, which is why there is an audited method of placing them – apparently not followed.Ken Mackay, Glasgow.FAR GREATER SINS IN LONDONPROFESSOR Douglas Pittseems to conveniently overlook, as does perhaps not unsurprisingly most of the western media, that the UK along with the US was a signatory in  to the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances with Russia which prohibited the use of military force against Ukraine \"except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations\".While both the US and the UK have indeed provided Ukraine with military training and defensive weaponry, this level of support falls far short of what was clearly expected by the Government of Ukraine, which has repeatedly called for the imposition of a no-fly zone over its country. However, not honouring commitments and responsibilities has regrettably not only become a hallmark of Boris Johnson but of the UK Government, which in spite of hypocritically welcoming propaganda effectively shuns all refugees, even those fleeing the devastation caused by UK weapons delivered by UK-trained armed forces.As for comments by Jane Laxand others disingenuously castigating the Scottish Government over the procurement of two ferries while not commenting on the far greater \"over-spend\" on two aircraft carriersas pertinently highlighted on the same page by Mary Thomas, it should be objectively noted that the UK Government has not only also wasted many more billionsof pounds through deliberate short-cut procurement, via its friends and political allies, of PPE supplies and associated coronavirus services but that this corrupt process was illegal – surely a far greater \"crime\" and worthy of these correspondents insights Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.REMEMBER THE TORIES FERRY FAILUREI COULD have taken Jane Lax’s resignation call to the Scottish Government seriouslyshe had applied the same call to the Westminster Cabinet, interestingly over ferry failings. After all, we all remember the Brexit ferry contract being awarded by the UK Government to Seaborne Freight, a company which did not own a single ferry and a company which had not previously operated ferry services. The UK Government was forced to cancel the contract at a cost in excess of £ million to UK taxpayers.Ms Lax is rightly concerned about the misuse of taxpayers money, something of which the UK Government has made a habit we all remember contracts awarded for unusable PPE products during the early days of the pandemic.She talks about collective responsibility of government at Holyrood, especially within the Cabinet as a whole and notes that to vote against Cabinet decisions is a resignation matter, while avoiding any mention of collective responsibility at Westminster. Only a matter of months ago Conservative MPs rebelled against their Government policy on Covid passports. Collective responsibility is one thing, but when Government policy is only secured with votes from the opposition benches, the Government’s authority to continue in office must come into question.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk.IRONY OF THE COMPARISONSONE of the most common tools used by independence supporters when faced with examples of SNP incompetence at Holyrood is to point at something the Conservatives at Westminster did wrong. So, references to the inability to build a ferry will evoke mentions of HS while a long list of the money wasted on ious projects will lead to an equally long list of similar misuses of public funds by the Tories. The interesting thing is this line of thinking seem to imply that it is OK for the SNP to make these kinds of mistakes because the Conservatives make them too. Alternatively, these mistakes are only unacceptable when it is the Conservatives or Westminster making them.This is especially ironic when one considers the other frequent argument of the SNP and its supporters: comparing Scotland to [insert country with a similar population or smaller here]. They never seem to want to compare the situation with Scottish ferries with the Denmark ferry service or compare the education systems of Scotland and Norway. I may be missing something but I thought the point of independence was that the Scottish Government was more competent than the UK one, not competing for second-last place.John Shanks, Glasgow.BE PREPARED FOR THE STATUS QUOIT would seem not even proportionally Watergate-level events in Scottish politics are shting support for the parties presently in power and making very bad decisions that affect us all. With this level of apathy and a diehard, sheep-like support, it looks like a long period of as you were is in store.The local elections polls appear to be indicating little or no sht. Not that it will make any dference to the outcome of any independence referendum, were one to be imposed on the majority who resolutely have indicated they do not want it and whose support appears to be increasing. This is the one occasion where those opposing the nationalists show a united front. The nationalist side will lose it, whatever the case.Methinks those at present running the coalition are more than aware of this and wish to spin the present state out as long as possible, ferry and other fiascos notwithstanding. They are guaranteed eye-watering salaries and expenses and constant exposure and very little or no media criticism. Who would want to give all that up So, fasten your seat belts for the status quo.Alexander McKay, Edinburgh.SNP SHOULD QUIT AFTER YES WINI WAS interested in Kevin McKenna’s articleas I thought just before the  independence vote that many voters were confusing the cause with the party espousing it. I thought then and still do now that had the SNP vowed on the eve of the vote to disband in the event of a Yes result, Yes would have carried the day.This is a mistake it shouldn’t make twice. Should a Yes vote ever be successful, the purpose of the SNP has been achieved. A popular commission or other democratic means should then be created to resolve all the “how” questions between vote and independence being declared. This would neatly remove all the “how” questions from the debate so the populace can focus on whether they as a people want to run their own affairs or not.Neil Robertson, Aberdeen.Read more: Well never have a fair society while were tied to Westminster"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13626171.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-maker-uses-e-waste-old-tech-make-startling-pieces-art","story":"One Scottish maker who also hoards old technology is Professor Sandra Wilson, but by utilising her knowledge of chemistry to create unique pieces of art from such e-waste, she has not only managed to free up some precious drawer space, but also recover and recycle rare metals to create something shiny and new in the form of jewellery and other artworks.Sandra Wilson, a veteran silversmith, jeweller, researcher and educator at the Dundee-based Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art  Design, is a Professor of Ecological Metal Design, currently specialisingin research into new surface finishes and metal alloys from precious metals recovered from e-waste.“What’s particularly interesting about the chemistry at Edinburgh is they’re working with metals and solution in liquid form,” she explains.“That gives us the scope to really innovate by using metals and its solution to paint on and create new surface finishes.”Sandra cites the jewellery industry as the largest user of precious metals, with the electronics industry also becoming a growing area of concern.“We are currently losing signicant amounts of gold and other precious metals from circulation, as only around % of precious metals in e-waste are recovered – with the rest often ending up in landfill,” she highlights.“It was The European Chemical Society that produced an endangered elements Periodic Table a couple of years ago. It shows that materials like copper, silver and gold,we continue to mine those at the current rate we are right now… we might run out of them in less than  years.“The jewellery industry therefore should really be leading the way in showing how we can work with precious metals more frugally, showing how we can recycle and recover precious metals whether from e-waste or recycling older pieces of jewellery.”To make her unique pieces, Sandra works with the chemistry laboratory using a method called hydro-metallurgy. Which essentially uses acid solution to recover precious metals from e-waste by stripping the plastic from products to extract specic metals such as copper or gold.Sandra’s enthusiasm for the science behind these new methods of chemical extraction is evident as she explains why this method of recovering precious metals excites her so much.“I’m able to see effects like I’ve never seen on pieces before,” she says.“I love to see myself as a kind of alchemist, in transforming metals from a solid form of electronic waste into solution and then back again into a solid form.”Public demand is slowly shting, Sandra says, towards sustainable consumer choices, with more people willing to ask the important questions.Gold rolled from a computer circuit She adds: “I would like to see e-waste gold becoming more commonplace within the jewellery industry, and I would like to see the e-waste recovery market in other countries such as India become a more formal process – where local artisans can benefit from the premium they can attract for their work.“If you’re getting married, you don’t want a ring where the gold has come from a conflict region, or somewhere where children have been involved in collecting the materials.“Increasingly people are meeting their partners online, soyour computer or phone was an integral part of your relationship then having engagement or wedding rings that have come from electronic waste might appeal.”www.sandrawilson"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13626334.jpg?type=article-full","title":"spend-48-hours-dundee","story":"Dundee is a city on the rise. Long neglected by tourists in favour of Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland’s fourth-largest city is changing at an incredible rate, I’m here to find outthe food and drink scene is keeping pace.“The VA is just the beginning”, Fiona Gray from Hotel Indigo tells me, and it’s a message I hear throughout my stay in Dundee. As traditional industries declined, new ones have developed and continue to, as Dundee reinvents itself as a city of innovation, culture and design. It’s the city of “Jute, Jam, Journalism – and now Joysticks”. In  Dundee was designated as a UNESCO city of Design for its contributions to art, medical research, comics and video games.The city’s plans for the next few years are bold and exciting. Dundee Esports Arena opens in , in the city that’s offered a degree in computer game design since and launched a dynamic new industry. The , seat venue aims to be the world’s best streaming venue, and will also bring more music and comedy events to Dundee. Eden Project Dundee is also aiming for , the exciting new project will be built on the former Dundee Gasworks and continue the rejuvenation of Dundee’s waterfront – and no doubt sharply increase visitors to the city.The opening of the dynamic VA has made waves in the Scottish art scene, but students, graduates and staff from Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art  Design have long put Dundee on the creative map. Situated in the heart of the DCA, Jute Café Bar is a bright, industrial style space. I choose a seafood platter which claims to be a light option: the heaving plate of crispy tempura squid, smoked salmon and chive brioche toast and gently spiced thai fishcakes tells a dferent but very enjoyable story. It’s a shame the big windows look out on a multi-storey carpark not the river beyond, but there’s plenty more to look at. I nab the seat beside ‘Artie the penguin’ and order a glass of Vinho Verde. I remember it’s a Monday and only just pm, but Artie doesn’t seem to mind.I’m staying at Hotel Indigo Dundee. This stylish hotel is in a converted jute mill and wears its heritage with pride. In the foyer there are lovingly curated mini exhibitions about the old and new Dundee industries, the perfect place to sink into a deep armchair and read a Beano. In the comfortable elegant bedrooms the little nods to the city are plentul – jute coloured curtains, marmalade cushions – and a very welcome jar to take home. Spot the ribbon edging in the room too – mine has a Dundee cake recipe, others have Grand Theft Auto cheat codes – I know which I could make better use of.Strolling around the city centre it’s clear that recent years and changing work patterns have hit local hospitality businesses hard, there are lots of empty units – but the ones that made it through are busy and there’s palpable potential. The pedestrianised areas are perfect for pavement dining. For a cosy café with a studenty feel, try Birchwood Emporium. The coffee is nice and strong and there’s a simple menu with a few interesting twists. The daily curry comes with a red rice, courgette salad and flatbread, and there are a lot of vegetarian and vegan options. A seat by the window was the perfect people-watching spot. I also liked Empire State Coffee. They carry a great range of Wild Hearth Bakery sourdough pastries, and serve up toasted bagels, soup and sandwiches.Near the art college Gallery  brings together authentic Spanish tapas and striking art exhibitions in a sunny stylish space. It’s the perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine, order a few little dishes, and discover new up and coming artists.I keep spotting signs for ‘Peh’, even ‘Peh and Prosecco’. I’m fairly sure it’s a pie, but stop in at Scott Brothers Butchers to check. I’ve come to the right place. The butcher tells me a Scottie’s Peh is a classic Dundee pie – fillings range from classic Scotch or steak and gravy, to mince and baked beans. Scott Brothers have been perfecting their recipes since  and they sell over , a week. I shouldn’t be surprised, it’s Desperate Dan’s hometown after all. I get a quick lesson in ordering pehs and bridies in a Dundee accent too .In the evening we eat at Daisy Tasker, housed in the same former jute mill as Hotel Indigo. Daisy Tasker was a former mill worker who organised the social activities here – she would recognise many of the mill’s remaining original features . It’s a funky well-designed space with comfy booths to spend an evening, dimmer lights would add to the sophistication. House cocktails were on the sweet side but tasty – we opted for a Rhubarb Ginsecco and a Marmalade Cosmo. My beetroot salad was definitely trumped by my dining partner’s delightful Arbroath Smokie risotto. Polenta came with charred sweetcorn and tenderstem broccoli and hazelnuts but was a little style over substance with crunchy radishes confusing the palate. The duck with squash, savoy cabbage and figs was a better choice. The restaurant is a lively stylish spot with well trained and helpful young staff and clear skill in the kitchen. It doesn’t quite follow through on the local links the hotel is so proud of, but with a few tweaks could easily do so. I’d love to see more provenance on the menu, perhaps some Dundee marmalade rather than wee jam packets at breakfast, and I would definitely have chosen more Arbroath Smokie with my perfectly poached eggs over avocado.Ready for a nightcap we head into town, following whispers of asecret bar. We find the door in a dark alleyway and descend the steps to Draffens. This speakeasy style bar is the place for a real cocktail and would be a hit in any capital city. The menu is extensive and original, told through the story of a ’s Draffens department store catalogue. With leather booths, dark green walls and good music, both the drinks and the atmosphere are elegant and self-assured – with a sense of humour too. In the same building but a few floors up there’s sophisticated Italian style The Blue Room which I’llto for an Aperol Spritz next time.In between eating opportunities, and to work up an appetite, I take a hike up Dundee Law and enjoy the better understanding of the landscape the view from here gives. I also visit The McManus Gallery which brings together art and history – there’s a new exhibition bringing an old street to le that’s a lot of fun.  Don’t miss the incredible exhibition of photographs by Joseph McKenzie, a portrait of the changing city from -.For a last late lunch we try Tahini, a family run Lebanese restaurant that people across the city keep recommending. It’s on a quiet street with an unassuming entrance, but the enticing smells that hit as soon as I open the door make any doubt disappear. Be prepared, portions are large so it’s easy to over-order, but you’re unlikely to mind. The fattoush was bright and fresh with plenty of parsley, falafel were crisp and tasty with a garlic and tahini dip, the baba ganoush was deliciously smoky, and an enormous portion of crispy halloumi almost defeated us. The staff were delightful and with helpful recommendations, and surprised us with excellent baklava and figs.I can’t leave Dundee without a visit to iconic Fisher  Donaldson. With branches across Fe and Angus this family run business has been baking sweet treats for over a century and the fudge doughnuts are legendary. The café here is like stepping back in time, in a very good way. Also planned for my next trip is newbie Wrecking Ball Doughnuts, owned by MasterChef winner and chef patron of The Newport Restaurant Jamie Scott. On the same street The Cheesery is a brilliant deli and yes, cheese shop. The food and drink scene in Dundee isn’t perfectly executed, it isn’t fully gentried or Instagram-perfect. It’s friendly. Portions are generous and smiles are genuine, everyone I ask happily recommends their favourite places, and there are no cafés too achingly cool to be comfortable. Dundonians seem proud of their history, of where they’ve come from and where they’re going, and so they should be. The future is exciting – and delicious. Mine’s a peh. "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

The publication of any statement under the authority of the Parliament is also absolutely privileged.Past examples of controversies include Donald Trump’s son Eric accusing Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie of making “libellous statements” in Holyrood.The Ferguson Marine row blew up after Jim McColl spoke out over the ferry fiasco when he said the calamitous ferry fiasco contract was agreed for political gain.Kate Forbes sidestepped questions about which minister signed off on the £m deal to build two CalMac ferries, but insisted that it did not breach any procurement rules.The First Minister had come under pressure after Mr McColl doubled down on allegations the award the Fergson Marine shipyard was made swtly because the SNP wanted to announce it at their autumn conference in October .Public spending auditors said ministers approved the calamitous ferries contract despite being warned that it carried “signicant risks” for taxpayers as it lacked usual financial safeguards including a builders refund guarantee.: Ferguson Marine: Ex-chief Jim McColl wished he had walked away from £m ferries dealAnd Mr McColl said that he believed the decision to to overrule advice from experts and sign off the contract was made by the First Minister along with then transport minister Derek Mackay, who oversaw a transition towards the nationalisation of the yard when it fell into administration in August, .Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited , the state-controlled firm that owns and procures CalMac’s ferries wanted to pull out of the contract weeks after the Inverclyde shipyard firm was named as the preferred bidder.But Ms Forbes has now sparked a row by passed the blame over the fiasco onto Mr McColl and his company.\"The contract was awarded in line with all of the procurement rules and practices in the normal way, as the Audit Scotland report confirms, and contrary to what Jim McColl said it was the chief executive of CMAL and Jim McColl himself who signed the contract. This is a man with a clear interest in shting the blame on others when the root cause, ultimately to the delays of these important vessels was the construction under FMEL,\" she said at the Scottish Parliament.Mr McColl has hit out at the finance secretary saying that what she said was defamation.\"They are good at saying things in Parliament, arent they, because they are protected from defamation,\" he said.\"What was said is totally untrue. This issue was not of FMELs making.\"Kate Forbes wasnt there at the time, and was not involved. All she is, is a spokesperson for the message the government want to put over.\"He said that all parties were aware of the lack of a builders refund guarantee and that he was unaware that there remained concerns - with both CMAL and FMEL signing off on the contract.Ministers carried out a takeover after Ferguson Marine went into administration following a dispute with CMAL over sprialling costs and \"unforeseen complexities\" over the ferries project.Mr McColl says that despite a formal complaint being sent to the First Minister in  complete with two detailed reports from impartial experts ministers failed to take responsible leadership and sanction the appointment of a suitably qualied independent expert to undertake the usual industrial arbitration to resolve the dispute.\"The reason they didnt step in is that CMAL had something over them. This is what they had over them, they were forced to take the contract. That is not us shting the blame.\"\"I thought CMAL were supportive of us, they gave us the order. They knew from day one we couldnt put up a [refund guarantee]. I told the government why. I said we were up against Polish yards, German yards, Turkish yards all of which have government schemes that back their refund guarantees. And we dont have that in the UK, so we are not on a level playing field. I couldnt put up a guarantee for £m and it was never on from day one.\"Scottish Labours shadow transport secretary Neil Bibby askedthe award of the contract without a full refund guarantee, was discussed and agreed by the cabinet andso were they made aware of CMALs concerns. He also askedthe position to ignore CMAL was made by Mr Mackay alone.But Ms Forbes sidestepped the question saying there had already been a debate on the subject.On Thursday Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood the \"buck stops with me\" over the deal.But she also highlighted that Mr Mackay was on holiday when the preferred bidder status was signed off. He resigned from the government in  over messages he sent to a teenage boy.Mr Bibby has written to the Scottish Parliaments public audit committee to call for Nicola Sturgeon and Derek Mackay to be summoned to give evidence on the ferries fiasco.There have been concerns that Mr McColls assertions could lead to legal challenges from the firms that lost out in the procurement process as it appeared set up to favour Port Glasgow-based Ferguson Marine.The tycoon said to the BBC had he known of the objections from CMAL he would have pulled out.The contract for Glen Sannox and an unnamed vessel known as Hull  was awarded a year after Mr McColl stepped in to rescue Ferguson, the last commercial shipyard on the River Clyde.The first ship was meant to enter service on the Arran route in the summer of  but is not expected to be ready until next year at the earliest - five years late. Hull , destined for an Outer Hebrides route, has gone the same way. The latest estimated cost for both ships is at least around a quarter of a billion pounds, off an original fixed contract price of £m.Mr McColl has previously accused the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon of announcing the contract publicly before a price had been agreed and told the Herald last year that the SNP wanted to make political capital out of it.He has also said that he believed he was a \"pawn\" in the Scottish Governments attempts to save the yard and while denying cronyism, that he got the contract due to his connections with previous SNP leader Alex Salmond and that the SNP government favoured the yard, and not him personally.SNP ministers have come under consistent criticism over the awarding of the ships contract after it emerged Ferguson Marine submitted the most expensive bid for the work out of six competing yards, but CMAL the yard the nod because it had the highest specication and quality.Ministers believe they were acting in the public interest in taking control of Ferguson Marine, as it saved the yard from closure, rescued more than  jobs and ensured that the two vessels under construction will be completed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"March ,  at : pmOrkney held it’s first Para-sports festival to the delight of participants.

Branches will remain vital in meeting customers’ needs but we must continually review our network to make sure we have branches in locations where customers need and use them the most.#As a result, we#ve made the dficult decision to close this branch because customers are using it less often.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year.

Council remains strongly committed to ensuring Mid and East Antrim is an accessible, safe, welcoming and inclusive place for every person living in or visiting the Borough. In , it was awarded the prestigious ‘Autism Impact Award’ for six of its venues in recognition of “going above and beyond” to create accessible and ‘autism-friendly’ environments – including Seven Towers Leisure Centre and The People’s Park. These award accreditations were presented by Autism NI, in partnership with the Northern Health and Social Care Trust .Pamela, Manager of The Fun Factory, commented: “The Fun Factory is very much behind Council’s ambition to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for every person of every age, background and ability living in or visiting our Mid and East Antrim – it’s something we very much strive to achieve in our own business. “We passionately believe that every child deserves the chance to have a fun and enjoyable experience in an environment in which they feel safe and comfortable.

Protection from the vaccine may be lower and may decline more quickly in these people.”She explained that while vaccines provide good protection against severe Covid- disease, protection against the Omicron iant seems to decline quickly even after a booster dose.She said the spring booster dose would help to address this.“This spring booster is being offered as a precaution to those at extremely high risk, most of whom received their first booster around six months ago. If the number of infections increases over the summer, this booster should help to reduce your risk of being admitted to hospital with Covid-.”The spring booster programme will begin in care homes from the start of April and will be carried out by community pharmacies.GPs will invite all their eligible patients who are aged over  for vaccination.They will also have the option to receive the booster at a participating community pharmacy or at a HSC Trust-led vaccination clinic.Health Trusts will also continue to run some vaccination centres as well as mobile clinics pop-up clinics.District nursing teams will continue to vaccinate the eligible housebound patients.Immunosuppressed iniduals are also eligible for the spring booster as long as there is at least three months since their previous dose.The Public Health Agency say Trust clinicians should write to advise their patients of this while GPs should provide a “safety net” service.Practices will be able to offer vaccination to any of their registered patients who meet the criteria of immunosuppressed at patient request of by practice identication.“COVID- has not gone away and we would urge those eligible to come forward for the spring booster when invited,” added Dr Johnston.Further infromation is available online at www.pha.site springbooster or by visit the NI Direct website.Most ReadBabel: Firefighters bring Belfast city centre blaze ‘under control’Council probes claim that ‘pro IRA songs’ played in Presbyterian Church grounds in Co AntrimNorthern Ireland spring booster vaccination to begin in April: Who is eligible Belfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupHow Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingTop VideosPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofPlaySDLP candidate menaced on the Shankhill road whilst campaigning \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCo Antrim woman on nightmare of discovering seven-year-old daughter Emma had rare bone cancer‘My husband was killed by a disease he didn’t believe was real’ – former Strabane DJ Joe McCarron’s widow on his death from CovidReids Shoes of Sandy Row goes up for sale for £, to mark the end of an eraViewpointOpinionParents need more information on jabLatestRoyal Portrush unveil new mixed-field Scratch Cup events as part of new policy of greater inclusionFree public transport scheme for Ukrainians arriving into Northern Ireland starting todayNorthern Ireland Under-s got a French lesson in friendly hammering, admits Sam McClellandWindsor Park roar will be help Northern Ireland, admits England Women#s coach Sarina WiegmanDavey Todd relishing #comfortable# North Westafter agreeing to ride on familiar Honda,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Pic Pacemaker FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueClimate change should be brought into all aspects of our children#s education. Pic PacemakerMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailTwo weeks ago I attended the Youth Environmental Education Congress in Prague. The World Environmental Education Conference has taken place every year since , and this year marked its first youth equivalent.Some  young people from  countries met to discuss how to better integrate climate change into education pathways.We talked about what education should look like in the st century and presented policy recommendations to decision-makers. We also learnt from one another, discussed ongoing projects in our respective countries, and participated in workshops led by academics and policy-makers.The theme of the conference was ‘building bridges’. The question we therefore sought to answer was how to successfully bridge the gap between environmental knowledge and environmental participation.The science behind climate change is well researched and well documented. A signicant proportion of the population already know about this science. However, what we are not seeing is this knowledge or awareness being turned into meaningful environmental action.While our current education systems operate on the basis that ‘knowledge is power’, it is quite clear that knowledge alone is not enough. We cannot continue along this  premise that knowledge alone will drive change.Even when people have environmental knowledge, this does not always translate to pro-environmental behaviour.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It is therefore not enough to equip people with knowledge. We need to change their behaviour. The role of our education system, then, needs to sht from one of transfer to one of transformation.When people think about integrating environmental education in the curriculum, the following question emerges: How can we do this successfully Naturally, incorporating topics like sustainability and bioersity into subjects like science and geography seems like an appropriate fit. This provides students with a rigorous understanding of the science behind climate change, and with evidence and practical examples to explain what is happening to our planet – and to the people living on it.However, I would argue that it is not enough to simply teach children about the environment. Instead, we need to teach them how to love and care for the environment. We therefore need to see environmental education being mainstreamed and incorporated into a range of subjects, including art, music and English.Linking climate change to multiple subject areas in interesting and innovative ways will not only improve children’s understanding of how climate change relates to society, but it will also empower children to think about climate solutions.From writing poems on climate change to painting natural landscapes, there are multiple ways to integrate environmental education into arts and humanities subjects. By doing this, we move beyond the mere transmission of environmental knowledge. We ‘humanise’ the climate crisis.A recent conversation with an English teacher reminded me of this. She explained how she took students to read Seamus Heaney poetry in the same bogs and peatlands detailed in his work.This made the lessons more memorable for the students, further engaging them in the content of the poetry, but it also invited them to re-connect with the environment surrounding them. They also spoke with the local community, asking them about how the landscape had changed over time, and such community engagement is another way to make education meaningful.The aim of environmental education is therefore not to simply flood children with reams of information on climate change. It is to foster children’s critical thinking and further connect them with the natural world – allowing them to understand that we are not apart from nature: we are a part of nature.One way in which schools can do this is by implementing outdoor learning. Outdoor learning connects students to nature, helping them to develop a duty of care to the environment. Outdoor learning also deconstructs the very notion of ‘learning’, showing us that learning can take place in many dferent settings.While some people may be unsure what to think about outdoor learning – especially in not-so-sunny Northern Ireland – growing research demonstrates how outdoor learning signicantly improves and accelerates children’s learning and development. For example, children’s motor development, co-ordination and balance hugely improve when they learn outdoors.Symptoms of children with Attention Deficit Disorder improve when they are outside, and nature also supports children’s language development, particularly for those learning a second language.Of course, many schools in built-up, urban areas of Belfast may not have easy access to an allotment or a community garden. However, research demonstrates that students’ performance increases even when they see greenery in the classroom. Simply installing window boxes outside the classroom or decorating the room with potted plants are therefore two viable suggestions for schools lacking green space.In many ways, thinking about the role of environmental education opens an interesting conversation about the role of our education systems more broadly. Exam-based learning has meant that education has become more about making people employable rather than making people better citizens. Beyond serving as an instrument for employability, we must also ensure that education fulfils a more purposeful role.If education refuses to change and evolve to meet the social and environmental challenges that students face, the system is not learning itself. Environmental education therefore reminds us of the imperative to educate for change. To educate for the future.Finally, it reminds us that education should empower us and learning should inspire us. These are truths we seem to have forgotten.Most ReadBabel: Firefighters bring Belfast city centre blaze ‘under control’Belfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupCouncil probes claim that ‘pro IRA songs’ played in Presbyterian Church grounds in Co AntrimCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body findNorthern Ireland spring booster vaccination to begin in April: Who is eligible Top VideosPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofPlaySDLP candidate menaced on the Shankhill road whilst campaigning \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirLatest Northern IrelandFree public transport scheme for Ukrainians arriving into Northern Ireland starting todayPSNI ‘very concerned’ by reports of young child wandering alone in CastlewellanBullitt hotel owner says rooftop is ‘completely destroyed’ after ‘accidental’ Babel fireIt’s a big ask to win next five games but Glentoran are up for the fight, maintains Mick McDermottSDLP election candidate Paul Doherty says he will not be deterred after being menaced by group of men on Shankill RoadLatestFree public transport scheme for Ukrainians arriving into Northern Ireland starting todayNorthern Ireland Under-s got a French lesson in friendly hammering, admits Sam McClellandWindsor Park roar will be help Northern Ireland, admits England Women#s coach Sarina WiegmanDavey Todd relishing #comfortable# North Westafter agreeing to ride on familiar HondaColin Turkington lays down a marker for new season after setting fastest time in first pre-season tests,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If an application fails to meet those tests, then we must refuse it.“The proposed constitution submitted by Irish Republican Socialist Party did not meet the legal requirements so therefore the application had to be refused.“We will assess it accordingly and take a decision on all aspects of the party’s application in line with the legal requirements.”He added: “We try to process registration applications as soon as possible after they are received.“However, the commission must carefully assess applications against the criteria set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act .“Undertaking this process can take some time in order to ensure the commission reaches a fair conclusion within the legislative requirements.”Most ReadBabel: Firefighters bring Belfast city centre blaze ‘under control’Council probes claim that ‘pro IRA songs’ played in Presbyterian Church grounds in Co AntrimNorthern Ireland spring booster vaccination to begin in April: Who is eligible Belfast restaurant issues ultimatum to culprit who covered worker’s car in ketchupHow Coronation Street actor Charlie Lawson saved the day at BBC broadcaster Emma Vardy’s weddingTop VideosPlayVideo: Blaze breaks out on Belfast Hotel bar roofPlaySDLP candidate menaced on the Shankhill road whilst campaigning \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news  .ece AUTOCROP wh babebedadbaecccae.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayVideo: Two arrested in Rathcoole following body discovery at Carrickfergus reservoirLatest Northern Ireland Assembly elections SDLP election candidate Paul Doherty says he will not be deterred after being menaced by group of men on Shankill RoadSinn Fein will ‘defend, but not renegotiate’ Good Friday Agreement: O’NeillSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesProtocol does not represent the best of both worlds for NI, DUP leader tells NI Chamber of CommerceSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismLatestRoyal Portrush unveil new mixed-field Scratch Cup events as part of new policy of greater inclusionFree public transport scheme for Ukrainians arriving into Northern Ireland starting todayNorthern Ireland Under-s got a French lesson in friendly hammering, admits Sam McClellandWindsor Park roar will be help Northern Ireland, admits England Women#s coach Sarina WiegmanDavey Todd relishing #comfortable# North Westafter agreeing to ride on familiar Honda,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is simply not fair on local families.Mr McGrath said a pattern was emerging whereby motorists in Newcastle sped along the Shimna Road from Donard Park and made their way up the Castlewellan Road.He urged police to get to grips with the issue to ensure people who live locally are no longer subjected to such behaviour.Cllr Devlin said the ldquoselfish actions of some drivers were not fair on residents, insisting that she and Mr McGrath will support those affected by the issue any way they can.ldquoWe shall be requesting a speed assessment of the area and asking police to consider monitoring any adverse behaviour, she confirmed.ldquoWe would appeal to local familiesthey do witness any reckless behaviour on the roads that could endanger lives to report it to police so they can gather all the necessary data..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch Camera Club competition in memory of Charlie  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Camera Club members welcomed Vitorrio Silvestri, from CPA Camera Club, last Thursday night to judge the entries which had been submitted for the annual Charlie Rutledge Memorial competition.Charlie was a much loved and respected founding member of Ballynahinch Camera Club and his great passion was mono photography.After Charlie passed away in  it was decided to hold a competition each year in his memory and what other genre of photographs could such a competition attract but black and white Vitorrio gave a critique on each image and, in some cases, demonstrated how they could be improved.

The Ballynahinch scheme represents excellent value for money and should have been prioritised during the past two years.Mr Hazzard said more than poundbn of capital resources has been spent by the roads minister and her department during the letime of the current Assembly.ldquoIt is hugely disappointing that a small, yet strategically important scheme, such as the Ballynahinch bypass has been left on the shelf. In light of the economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would have been a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of the local community, said the MP.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWe can only hope now that when the Executive is restored after Mayrsquos election, that the local community can have a minister in place who recognises the value of the Ballynahinch bypass and finally begins construction.Mr Casement said the bypass could help kick-start the economic regeneration of the town and provide the wider South Down tourism economy with a signicant boost. He said it was vital a start date for construction work is confirmed as soon as possible.A key member of Ballynahinchrsquos Regeneration Committee for many years alongside the late Vincent Fullam, Mr Casement has never given up the battle to secure a bypass, which was first mooted in the late s.ldquoThe bypass is included in a list of strategic projects and is effectively ready to proceed.

crowned Bobby Dalzell Cup champions after defeating local rivals Ardglass in the deciding penalty shoot-out at Meadowvale last Thursday.A goal on the stroke of half-time from Ardglass midfielder Stephen Deegan was cancelled out on  minutes by the close range effort of Celtic striker Jordan McCoubrey.The teams refused to be split in extra-time and following the shoot-out mdash which went well into the sudden death stages mdash Blaine Connolly converted the all-important spot kick to gt his Hoopsrsquo side the victory.A large crowd turned out in Drumaness for the St Patrickrsquos Day showpiece between the current first and second-placed sides in the Newcastle Leaguersquos Premier Division.Adding to the pressure of the occasion was the alternating weather conditions, with the teams contesting the final in periods of sunshine as well as wind and rain.Nevertheless, Celtic kicked off the affair with the blustery conditions heavily in favour of their opponents.It didnrsquot take long for the tone of the match to be set as Ardglass defender Caolain OrsquoShea launched a very physical tackle on Hoops striker Jay Gibney.Ardglass enjoyed early momentum with experienced defender Neil Teggart seeing his wind-assisted free kick from his own half trouble Celtic custodian Nathan Curran less than ten minutes in.Celtic remained calm and soon strung their passes together through clever one touch football with eventual man of the match winner Conor Doherty in the thick of these sequences.However, Ardglass remained a threat and came close when Teggart clipped a cross into the danger area, although striker Michael Magee glanced his header wide.Stand-in Celtic captain Shaun Megahey attempted to play a through ball to team-mate Gibney, but on this occasion the Ardglass defence timed the offside trap perfectly.Celtic did come close when Barry Treacyrsquos corner kick was fumbled by Ardglass lsquokeeper, Mark Armstrong, although Hoops defender Paul Brady couldnrsquot dispatch the ball quickly enough before the danger was cleared.OrsquoShea continued his earlier eagerness and picked up a yellow card for a mistimed tackle before his team-mate, Magee, was unfairly clattered at the other end of the pitch, although Teggartrsquos effort flew past the wrong side of the post.Teggart continued to be a problem from set pieces as his free-kick delivery whisked past the head of striker Magee and out of bounds.Moments later, Mageersquos misfortune continued when he was shown a yellow card for expressing his disagreement with referee, Barry Mullan.After initially allowing the match to flow freely, referee Mullan clamped down on his decisions with less than ten minutes to the end of the opening half.Celtic defender Gary Carberry was the latest to enter the book for a late challenge on Ardglass marksman Magee.Despite this hiccup, Celticrsquos Carberry kept himself in contention for the man of the match accolade after he proved pivotal in stopping potential goalscoring chances from the Ardglass opposition on numerous occasions.As the half-time whistle approached, Celtic arms were raised as they appealed for the red card to be shown to Ardglassrsquos OrsquoShea, who may have considered himself lucky to escape an early bath after he was second to the ball.Ardglass launched another attack and it looked asMagee would have a free route to goal. However, Celtic veteran Brady recovered valiantly to prove he still has plenty of miles left in his tank.With the last attack of the half, Ardglass were awarded a corner and they took full advantage of their opportunity. Midfielder, Stephen Deegan, climbed high above the rest to head his effort beyond the outstretched hand of Celtic lsquokeeper Curran to open the scoring.As the second half kicked off it was evident that both sides would refrain from going for broke. A lot of the following ten minutes contained attacks, although both sides lacked a killer instinct and the match was heavily contested in the middle of the pitch.This is where Conor Doherty earned his post-match award for his performance, as he often won the midfield battle.Goal-scorer Deegan picked up a yellow as the weather took yet another turn for the worse.Celtic joint-managers Jason Galbraith and Matthew McKenna made the first of their substitutions as the clock struck the hour mark with Sean McMahon entering the fray in place of Conaill Kerr.Ardglass opted to put  men behind the ball in order to frustrate the opposition and waited patiently for their opportunity to counter-attack.Ardglass made changes of their own in the form of Jordan Finnegan before Celtic made a second substitute with the talented Sean Ferris making his way onto the pitch.Ferris made an immediate impact, adding another string to Celticrsquos bow by spreading inviting passes into his forward line.With just  minutes left of the , these Celtic substitutions came to fruition after the ball found its way to McMahon, who lofted an inviting ball into the Ardglass box which was steered home by the boot of striker McCoubrey.Celtic continued to mix things up as Corey McCartan made his way onto the pitch and gave a good account of himself with his tireless work rate.Despite this period of succession for the Hoops, the remaining minutes of the  played out finely balanced.Ardglass never let their headsand should be commended for their effort as they cancelled out any further attack whilst continuously seeking the crucial next goal.As tempers flared, the final whistle sounded and both teams prepared for extra-time.The highlights of the first half of extra-time came in the form of Celticrsquos Treacy picking up a yellow card before team-mate Ferris crashed his left-footed effort off the crossbar.During the next interval, both of Ardglassrsquo Magee and Celticrsquos Ferris threatened but they couldnrsquot do enough to get the ball over the line and it would be penalties that would decide the final outcome.Amongst the numerous penalties which took place, both Celtic and Ardglass players were ordered to retake their spot kicks.Firstly, Celtic striker McCoubrey saw his effort denied by Armstrong before referee Mullan blew his whistle after adjudging the Ardglass custodian to be off his line as the penalty was taken.McCoubrey fired in the retake and it wouldnrsquot be long before Ardglass substitute Finnegan would go through a similar course of events after he missed his initial penalty but converted at the second time of asking.Eventually, as the penalties progressed well into sudden death, Celticrsquos Blaine Connolly remained calm and converted the deciding spot kick to send the Hoopsrsquo support into delirium as his side were crowned champions.Following the conclusion, man of the match Conor Doherty gave his thoughts on his sidersquos victory.ldquoI thought we were the better team in the first half but then they snuck a goal before half-time, he said.ldquoBut, even with the wind we started to press on, it was a long  minutes.ldquoIt was a hard hitting game but Irsquom just glad we got on the winning side of it.He added: ldquoAll the penalties were top class, it was a really good shootout.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey , B Connolly, P Brady, G Carberry, C

The business centre would also encompass a multi-purpose meeting room.The committee, which is headed by local businessman, Mr Michael Heron, is seeking funding under the CRISP programme of the Department of Environment and the International Fund.It would act as the lsquocorersquo project to trigger other public and private sector investment in the town in areas such as upgrading footpaths, improving lighting and restoring derelict buildings.STRANGFORD mdash The Department of the Environment has been urged not to cancel a package of improvements for Strangford.The appeal was made by the chairman of Strangford Village Committee, Mr John Steenson, who said the recent decision by residents to veto plans for a new ferry jetty should not jeopardise improvements earmarked for the village.Speaking at the committeersquos annual meeting, Mr Steenson said a new, re-styled ferry terminal would be widely welcomed by residents, while a traffic scheme in the DoE car park would do much to reduce traffic congestion within the village.Mr Steenson said he was ldquogratied by the number of residents who attended the public meeting at which the improvements were discussed.ldquoThe great majority at the meeting were implacably opposed to the building of what seemed to them to be a long and unsightly jetty into the lough to act as a mooring for the two ferries, Mr Steenson remarked.ldquoAlthough there was no detailed discussion of the committeersquos suggestion that the ferry terminal be relocated outside the village, or the village by-passed by a new road, I think most people accepted, able reluctantly, that the proposal was simply not possible because of the cost, he said.KILLYLEAGH mdash Delamont Country Park, outside Killyleagh, looks set to be officially opened around Easter, it was agreed this week.Down Council is to push ahead with the opening arrangements following complaints that it has taken too long to get the prestigious project off the ground.Councillors have complained that a prime opportunity to publicise the park has been missed because it was not possible to hold an official opening when Ulster Television was filming in the district over St Patrickrsquos week.At the monthly council meeting it was also revealed that a businessman, who has opened a garden centre in Delamont, is annoyed because he was told the official opening would take place at Halloween last year.Mr John Cushnie opened his centre in July  and he claims he was given assurances by council officers that the park would officially open within four months.When the opening did not take place, Mr Cushnie went back to the councilrsquos recreation committee and only last month was told the opening ceremony would take place around St Patrickrsquos Day.Another businessman, who plans to open an exotic bird centre at Delamont, claims he has been kept waiting for firm proposals regarding the piece of land on which he needs to build the centre.ARDGLASS mdash District nursing sisters Philomena Hanna and Pauline McEvoy are continuing a tradition which dates back to the th century and Florence Nightingale.Butthe district nurse had her beginnings in Victorian Britain, she is very much a part of the late th century, having at her disposal all the skills and resources of the modern health service.Even sock there remains the fundamental commitment to the wellbeing of the community which inspired the founders more than  years ago. Based in Ardglass, Sisters Hanna and McEvoy carry on the tradition of combining the roles of nurse, friend and comforter.It was on the advice of Florence Nightingale, lsquoThe Lady With the Lamprsquo who sprang to national prominence for her pioneering work during the Crimean War, that a certain William Rathbone established the first training school for district nurses in .The aim was to educate women in all aspects of nursing care and therefore bring relief to the poor who were living in appalling conditions in the urban slums created as a consequence of the Industrial Revolution.By , there were  district nurses in the Liverpool area. As the benefits quickly became apparent, the service spread to other parts of Britain.

After a briefto live in the south of England, Pat eventually settled in New Zealand where he spent the rest of his le.Patrsquos landscape photography is stunning and his portraits of local people are without parallel mdash they reveal a strong sense of place, identity and the character of the people.Particularly important is that most of the people have been identied.The photographs were mostly taken in the s and s, but since then the world has changed in many ways. Some of the landscapes may look the same, but buildings have gone, farming le is radically dferent and the fishing industry decimated.Cecil Newman grew up in Belfast, but from a young age enjoyed hiking and youth hostelling. He studied engineering at Queenrsquos University and joined the Royal Engineers during World War II.Whilst working in Berlin after the war to help with the processes of reconstruction, Cecil took some striking photographs of the devastated city. Some of these images were later given to the Berlin City Museum.After the war Cecil ed to work as surveyor for Belfast City Council and later as a planner in the Northern Ireland Civil Service. Amongst the many high-profile projects with which he was involved were the first Newry Area Plan and the Mourne Study. Both these publications included his photographs.During the s he concentrated particularly on aerial photographs. He was a leading member of the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside and Mournes Advisory Council, often giving talks illustrated with his photographs and slides. After his death the Ulster Society for the Preservation of the Countryside erected a memorial in his honour at Trassey car park in the Mournes.Photographs taken by him which are now in the Down County Museum collection reflect both his work and passion for the Mournes. An outstanding feature of Cecilrsquos photographs is that they were accompanied by date and Ordnance Survey map grid reference mdash what curator could ask for more The importance of these two photographic collections is that they complement each other, in covering the same geographical area, but taken for dferent purposes and at dferent times.The number of images represented is smaller than the DJ McNeill archive so it was possible for the museumrsquos curatorial staff to catalogue them all and the Museum Photographer to digitise them.What remains to be done is adding the images and full information to the Museumrsquos database and more to the website. There are always more jobs to be carried out on the collection.However, using the images effectively, and in the way the Hudson and Newman families, and indeed all other donors, wished, requires wide knowledge of all the collections by experienced and qualied professional staff working with them on a daily basis.The photographic archive is recognised as one of the most important in Ireland and contains a wide range of images, including daguerrotypes, glass negative plates, lantern slides, black and white and colour film, transparencies as well as digital images.Understanding of all the processes involved in their making is essential to how they are cared for and used.Lesley Simpson is secretary of the Friends of Down County Museum and former Keeper of Collections at the museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Success at Downpatrick  ","story":"PRIOR to Sundayrsquos Randox Ulster National Handicap Chase meeting at Downpatrick Racecourse, manager Richard Lyttle stated that he was looking forward to welcoming racegoers back to the track for the first time in three years.They certainly turned up with car parks filled to capacity, packed enclosures and long tailbacks on the Ballydugan Road prior to the first race.The Randox Ulster National has been the local tracks major race of the year now for many years and the maximum  runners faced the starter for the three mile four furlong race that sees prize money paid right down to the first six past the post.A bit like the big Aintree race, there was plenty of fallers with two coming down at the very first fence and Envoi Pierji then unseating Donegal jockey Conor Orr, who had ridden Screaming Colours to success for Bill Durkan in the Midlands National at Uttoxeter the previous day.Later in the race there was more fallers at the regulation fence.With two fences to be taken the race involved four runners with the  winner Amaulino travelling like the winner under David McGrath.But this combination then faded, eventually finishing fourth for Co Armagh trainer Keith Watson.The eventual winner in the famous J P McManus Silks proved to be Spades Are Trumps, ridden by Cheltenham winning jockey Mark McDonagh, a lb claimer.Finishing second was Agent Born, ridden by Darragh OrsquoKeefe with Peaches and Cream third.Co Meath trainer Gavin Cromwell, who also had success at Cheltenham, saddled the winner and also the third past the post.

Rabbits are still common today, although the population was decimated by the myxomatosis disease in the s.The s was also when the National Trust began managing the habitat on behalf of its owners, the Hill family mdash commonly known as the Marquises of Downshire.The Hill family came to the area in the late th century but had lived in Ireland since the late s, when a young army officer named Moyses Hill, originally from Devon, was posted to Carrickfergus garrison in  to command forces sent by Elizabeth I to subdue the rebellious OrsquoNeill clan and colonise Ireland.Moyses ended up staying in Ireland and marrying the sister of a local clan chief. In , he was granted land at Cromlyn, an area which later took his surname and became known as Hillsborough. His descendants then acquired Murlough in  and began using Murlough Farm as their summer residence.They built Murlough House in , which still stands today at the end of Keel Point mdash at the northern end of the beach. While built to have a spectacular sea view, stormy weather kept breaking the windows, so trees were planted around the house in , and the woodland remains to this day.In , the th Marquis of Downshire, Arthur Hill, sold the surrounding land to the National Trust and then sold the house in . The area became Irelandrsquos first nature reserve in  and remains the most extensive dune heath in Ireland .But prior to being sold to the National Trust, Murlough House and the dunes were a hotbed of military activity ndash particularly during WWII. The house was a base for the US Armyrsquos st Armoured Division and the th Tank Destroyer Battalion.They built several firing ranges in the dunes, including, allegedly, a mortar range. Spare bombers and fighters were also hidden there as Murlough Farm had its own landing strip, called lsquo Satellite Landing Groundrsquo .Murlough beach itself was dotted with anti-aircraft and anti-invasion posts mdash whose rotting remnants are still visible today. They were dug-in when a full-scale German invasion was a threat in the early s.They were part of a counter-invasion strategy that centred on slowing or stopping the enemy at certain locations until other forces could be mustered and deployed. This involved constructing a so-called lsquocoastal crustrsquo along beaches and inland lsquostop-linesrsquo along rivers, canals and high ground.With Northern Ireland being prime invasion territory, a coastal crust was set up from Magilligan in the north-west to Newcastle in the south-east, alongside an inland stop-line along the route of the River Bann. Anti-aircraft landing posts, like those at Murlough, were important in preventing aircraft or boats from landing, but another type of defence was the centrepiece of this strategy: pillboxes.When events at Dunkirk in  sparked invasion panic, the Directorate of Fortications and Works at the War Office was created to construct defensive systems around the UKrsquos beaches. The Royal Engineers and civilian contractors erected over , pillboxes by in a matter of days ndash including on eight of Northern Irelandrsquos beaches.Such structures can still be seen at Magilligan, Portrush and Portstewart. County Down also has intact examples in Bangor, Donaghadee and on the Strangford shore between Comber and Newtownards. Beaches at Minerstown and Tyrella also had multiple pillboxes, as did Murlough. They were spaced to have interlocking arcs of fire, so invaders had little unchallenged space in which to land.One of these pillboxes is still visible in Newcastle, on the beach just below the outdoor swimming pool. The remnants of the other are still visible at the northern end of Murlough, next to the inlet that feeds Dundrum Bay. Yet all that is left are large slabs of reinforced concrete as this pillbox was supposedly destroyed in the early days of the Troubles to prevent it being used to attack the nearby Ballykinlar Army Camp.But these remains are now also under attack from erosion. They are gradually being absorbed by the sea. With this stretch of coastline losing five to ten metres of coastline a year, the remnants of the pillbox, originally built at an elevated height in the dunes, is even starting to be submerged at high tide.What was once a reflection of an indominable spirit is now an unassuming pile of rubble used only as a seat for resting walkers ndash most of whom are unaware of its history. Soon, it will be completely forgotten and the only reminder of this stretch of coastlinersquos rich military history will be the occasional washed-up ordnance.Ben Acheson spent seven years deployed to Afghanistan, including stints as Director of NATOrsquos political team and as Political Adviser to the EU Special Representative.

It was in this context that we seek to bring together all sections of political unionism at a protest rally to be held in Lurgan on Friday, April .The purpose is to demonstrate a united unionist front, with all sections of political unionism standing shoulder-to-shoulder with grassroots loyalists and unionists in opposition to the protocol.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Our organisation comprises members of the loyal orders and local bands, many of whom it must be noted served with distinction in the security forces over  years to defend this province from republican terrorism.We are not rabble rousers out to increase tension. Rather we are law abiding, peaceful and loyal citizens.We would call upon Mr Beattie to publicly apologise for his comments which, whether he intended it or not, have besmirched the name and reputation of our organisation, the loyal orders, and thousands upon thousands of loyal Ulstermen who have taken to the streets to exercise their democratic and legitimate right to peacefully protest against the imposition of this protocol for which they did not vote and to which they do not consent.Mr Beattie has failed to explain how his strategy of negotiating with the EU while at the same time implementing the protocol via the Assembly will ever result in the destruction of the protocol.Negotiation by its very nature results in agreement and compromise. Unionism cannot compromise on this issue. Unionism cannot accept anything less than the complete destruction of the protocol.We call on all of our fellow loyalists across Ulster to join with us on April  in sending a clear message to all of our opponents that we will never accept a border in the Irish Sea and that we will never be part of a process designed to ease Ulster into a united Ireland.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMajor changes to recycling have already been made in Barry and rural parts of the Vale of Glamorgan, with separate containers used for dferent materials.As a new recycling plant is set to open in Barry later this year, these changes are almost ready to roll out to the eastern parts of the Vale in October.Vale of Glamorgan council, which has the second best recycling rate in Wales, has set out a plan for the next decade on how to increase recycling rates further.Peter King, cabinet member for neighbourhood services and transport, said the Vale’s recycling rates could even be some of the best in Europe.He said: “In – we recorded a recycling performance of . per cent, the second highest performance in Wales, and likely one of the highest performance figures in the UK and maybe even the EU. We have achieved this performance due to our change to source segregated kerbside recycling.“I can’t underestimate or over-exaggerate the herculean efforts of our residents, I really do appreciate that. However, about one third of our residents, those living in Penarth, Dinas and the other eastern Vale areas have not yet benefited from these new recycling arrangements and are still co-mingling their materials.”He was speaking during a cabinet meeting on Monday, March , when council bosses approved a new recycling and waste management business plan. Improving recycling rates forms a major part in the council’s decarbonisation plan, called Project Zero.Barry and western parts of the Vale already separate their recycling, with an orange bag for cardboard a white bag for paper a grey caddy for glass bottles and jars a blue bag for plastic, cans and cartons a green caddy for food waste and a green bag for garden waste.The changes were introduced in rural areas in October  and in Barry in October ..removePenarth and Dinas Powys and eastern parts of the Vale still mix recycling into a blue bag. The changes aim to improve the quality of recyclable materials, which is better for the environment and means the council gets a higher income from selling the material. Mixing recycling together can often mean the material is contaminated and unable to be recycled.A -week public consultation will be held in the summer on the new -year recycling plan, before it gets final approval. The changes will likely be introduced in October in Penarth, Dinas Powys, Llandough and Sully.Pembrokeshire has the highest recycling rate in Wales, with . per cent, and Cardf the lowest, with . per cent.Before the changes can be rolled out, work needs to be finished on a new recycling plant in Barry, as the current one in Cowbridge is at full capacity. The new plant is under construction at the Atlantic Trading Estate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe launch came six days after rival North Korea conducted its first intercontinental ballistic missile test since  in an apparent attempt to expand its weapons arsenal and increase pressure on the US amid stalled talks.South Korea’s domestically built solid-propellant rocket was launched from a state-run testing facility in the presence of defence minister Suh Wook and other senior officials, the Defence Ministry said in a statement.It said solid-fuel rockets have simpler structures and are cheaper to develop and manufacture than liquid-fuel rockets. It said solid-fuel rockets also reduce launch times. vw,vw,px, px\"The rocket was launched from an undisclosed location The statement said South Korea will soon launch a spy satellite into orbit aboard a solid-fuel rocket.South Korea has no military reconnaissance satellite of its own and depends on US spy satellites to monitor strategic facilities in North Korea.In , South Korea won US consent to use solid fuel for space launch vehicles, a restriction that Washington had previously imposed on its key Asian ally out of concerns that its use could lead to building bigger missiles and trigger a regional arms race.Wednesday’s launch came amid tensions over North Korea’s ICBM launch last Thursday, which broke its own moratorium on big weapons tests and violated multiple UN Security Council resolutions.South Korea’s Defence Ministry concluded earlier this week that North Korea fired the Hwasong- ICBM, rather than the newer, bigger, longer-range Hwasong- that North Korea claimed to have tested.“Coming at a very grave time following North Korea’s lting of the weapons tests moratorium, this successful test-launch of the solid-fuel space launch vehicle is a key milestone in our military’s efforts toa unilateral space-based surveillance system and bolster defence capability,” the South Korean statement said..removeThe rival Koreas remain ided along a heavily fortied border since their ision at the end of the Second World War in .To cope with North Korea’s increasing nuclear threats, South Korea has been building and purchasing powerful conventional missiles, stealth fighter jets and other high-tech weapons systems.But South Korea has no nuclear weapons and is under the protection of the US “nuclear umbrella”, which guarantees a devastating American response in the event of an attack on its ally..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: South Korea in  ukey rocket launch u  u days after North us ICBM test article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Picture: Leon Neal - WPA Pool Getty ImagesDr Jillian Johnston, Joint Interim Assistant Director in Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Covid- is more serious in older people and those with a weakened immune system. Protection from the vaccine may be lower and may decline more quickly in these people.“Although vaccines are expected to provide good protection against severe COVID- disease, protection against mild infection with the Omicron iant seems to decline quickly, even after a booster dose, so the additional spring booster will help address this.“This spring booster is being offered as a precaution to those at extremely high risk, most of whom received their first booster around six months ago. If the number of infections increases over the summer, this booster should help to reduce your risk of being admitted to hospital with Covid-.”What are the spring booster programme arrangements Care homes: The spring booster programme will begin in care homes from the start of April and community pharmacies will complete this element of the programme. Over s:GPs will invite all their eligible patients aged  years or older in for vaccination. In addition to being invited by their own GP to receive a spring booster, iniduals aged over  will have the option to receive their spring booster vaccination via a participating community pharmacy or at a HSC Trust-led vaccination clinic.Vaccination centres:Trusts will continue to run some vaccination centres as well as mobile clinics   pop-up clinics.Housebound patients:Trustswill continue to vaccinate the eligible housebound patients.Immunosuppressed iniduals are also eligible for the spring booster but it is likely that many of these iniduals will have only recently received their booster dose, three months after they had received a third primary dose. These iniduals should be offered the booster during the spring campaign providing there is at least three months from the previous dose. Trust clinicians should write to advise their patients of this and GPs should provide a “safety net” service. Practices can offer vaccination to any of their registered patients who meet the criteria as immunosuppressed at patient request or by practice identication.“Covid- has not gone away and we would urge those eligible to come forward for the spring booster when invited,” added Dr Johnston.More information can be found at www.pha.site springbooster.Read More Read MoreArmagh, Banbridge, Craigavon and Mid Ulster areas suffered highest proportion of...Covid-Northern IrelandPractices  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularGilford schoolboy Jude Hill is a massive hit on the red carp...NewsRail line from Portadown to Belfast reopens after security a...NewsRathcoole murder: Roy Reynolds named as victim, detectives g...NewsCo Tyrone man contravened Covid restrictions at bare knuckle...NewsCovid- spring booster: who is eligible and how to get it...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The Fund can provide a non-repayable grant of up to pound,, in a  month period, to remove barriers to employment. The Minister continued: “The success of the Adviser Discretion Fund in helping remove barriers to employment has already been seen throughout the year, particularly in the uptake of upfront childcare costs, which I made available last October. “I am delighted that we have already helped around  parents with average upfront childcare costs of approximately pound. “This additional scheme will help remove similar barriers to employment for those facing digital exclusion due to a lack of broadband service.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffaacbaacaebe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_aedcfbfdbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1613125631842.jpg--booster_third_dose_milestone_welcomed.jpg?161312563100","title":"booster third dose milestone welcomed ","story":"The number of COVID- vaccine boosters and third doses administered in Northern Ireland has passed the one million mark. The milestone has been welcomed by Patricia Donnelly, head of Northern Ireland’s vaccination programme. She said: “GPs, community pharmacists and Trusts have all worked extremely hard to roll out the booster campaign, with the period in the run up to Christmas particularly busy. “They all deserve our heartfelt thanks. Because of the vaccines, we now have much greater protection against the virus. “All those involved in the vaccination programme are genuine history makers.” Booster doses have been provided from the latter stages of last year, supplementing the two primary doses already received. At the same time, a third primary dose was offered to people with a severely weakened immune system, which was then followed by a booster three months after their third primary dose. The latest tallies on Northern Ireland’s vaccination dashboard include , boosters and , third doses. Patriciacontinued: “While demand for vaccines is no longer at levels from the peak of the campaign, people are still coming forward on a daily basis for boosters and first and second doses. “It’s still not too late to get these jabs. Please do so - and benefit from the really important protection they bring.” The one million landmark has been reached with the Spring booster campaign imminent. In line with UK-wide guidance set by the JCVI, the Spring campaign will offer an additional booster dose to: anyone who is aged  or over care home residents and anyone aged  and over who has a severely weakened immune system.
