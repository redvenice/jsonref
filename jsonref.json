Photograph: Getty ImagesThe outgoing DUP MEP Diane Dodds was formally nominated on Tuesday to contest next month’s European Parliament elections, making her and Sinn Féin’s outgoing MEP Martina Anderson overwhelming favourites to take two of the North’s three seats.The decision, however by Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) outgoing MEP Jim Nicholson not to seek re-election, together with the difficulty of predicting how the Remain-Leave Brexit breakdown in Northern Ireland will affect voting, has raised the possibility of a tight three- or four-way tussle for the final seat. The SDLP and Alliance are seriously considering running their respective leaders Colum Eastwood and Naomi Long in the election, while former UUP minister and Assembly member Danny Kennedy has emerged as the frontrunner to replace Mr Nicholson.The Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister, if he decides to run, also could have a chance of sneaking the third seat.SDLP and Alliance sources said that both Mr Eastwood and Ms Long were contemplating running for Europe. The UUP is scheduled to meet on Saturday to select the party’s candidate in advance of the May 23rd European Parliament election. After 74-year-old Mr Nicholson said he would not be recontesting the seat he has held for almost 30 years, Mr Kennedy, who lost his Assembly seat in Newry and Armagh two years ago, said he would be seeking the nomination.A Traditional Unionist Voice source said the party was “teasing out” the pros and cons of whether its leader and North Antrim MLA Mr Allister should stand again.A further complicating factor in the election will be the turnout considering that if Brexit does finally go ahead then the three MEPs will quickly be out of their jobs.In 2014 Ms Anderson won 159,813 first preference votes, while Ms Dodds won 131,163. Mr Nicholson won 83,438 votes, while former West Belfast MLA Alex Attwood, now retired from politics, was close behind on 81,594 votes.Mr Allister won 75,806, and the former Alliance South Belfast MLA Anna Lo won 44,432 votes. Final countMr Attwood only lost out on the eighth and final count in 2014, when Mr Allister’s transfers got Mr Nicholson over the line.This would indicate that were Mr Eastwood to run he would have a reasonable chance of taking the third seat from the UUP, particularly should the Remain vote rally to his cause.Based on the figures he would appear to have the advantage over whoever Alliance chooses as its candidate as the SDLP was more than 37,000 votes ahead of Alliance in 2014.Currently Alliance is deciding whether to field Ms Long or its Brexit spokesman Stephen Farry, with one senior source suggesting its leader is likely to be the runner.There would be a risk for Mr Eastwood should Mr Long be selected as based on her centre-ground popularity she is likely to have a good chance of garnering a significant portion of cross-community votes, notwithstanding that the SDLP was so far ahead of Alliance five years ago.Mr Kennedy is viewed as a moderate and popular unionist and would be in a good position to hold on to Mr Nicholson’s vote.Mr Allister would also be likely to poll well.It all adds up to an intriguing and uncertain battle for the final seat to an election which, after all the votes are counted, might become meaningless."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/09/25/TELEMMGLPICT000081414815_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqYcr1RrDab1C1CeaI0a6D83NnzwmbFi9eJdB9KHJJuc8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"house prices soaring homeowners bored brexit want get lives","story":"The average asking price on a home jumped by nearly £3,500 in April House prices are soaring because homeowners are bored of Brexit and want to get on with their lives, a new report says.The average asking price on a home jumped by nearly £3,500 in April -

which is still 0.1 per cent lower than a year ago despite the spring bounce in April.Rightmove said it is usual to see prices increase at this time of year, but this is still the biggest increase seen for the month of April since 2016.But it said the uncertain political backdrop continues to hold back the market, with new seller asking prices, the number of properties coming to market and the number of sales agreed all below this time last year.Chart: Average UK house price over the past 25 yearsMiles Shipside, Rightmove director, said: The rise in new seller asking prices reflects growing activity as the market builds momentum, egged on by the arrival of Easter.He added: They are often second-steppers out-growing their first property and it gets harder to postpone a move with growing children.They may have already delayed for a year or two waiting for Brexit clarity, and understandably their patience is wearing thin.Mr Shipside said the Brexit extension could also now give hesitating home movers encouragement that there is now a window of relative certainty in uncertain times.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Please review our commenting policyNotre-Dame fire: How the blaze tore through ancient timbers, damaged walls and led to a race to save artworkTrust Me, series 2 episode 1, review: daft premise but the canny cast carry it throughUnder 18s to be barred from porn websites under age restrictions to be introduced within weeksThe Great British School Swap episode one review: exploitative culture clash show lacking in insight or emotional heftLibyan suspect in Yvonne Fletcher murder could be forced to give evidence in High Court actionComment: Where would we be now if Remain had won the referendum?Criminals to be handed clean slate under Sajid Javid plan to wipe minor offences when applying for jobsGrassroots Conservative chairmen planning no-confidence vote in Theresa May \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39You never imagine as a firefighter being called on to save Notre-Dame\u0026#39: the hero Parisians who saved their cathedralDigital blueprints and 1,300 oak trees: How Notre-Dame will be rebuiltRecord 70 per cent of Russians say Stalin played a positive role in their country\u0026#39s history Former Isil bride living freely in HamburgLocal council launches inquiry into councillor who used emojis to label rival a \u0026#34b***end\u0026#34 World watches as UK announces it will drop key childhood vaccine to two dosesDonald Trump \u0026#39shown pictures of children hospitalised by Novichok to persuade him to act against Russia\u0026#39Comment: It would be a travesty to rebuild Notre Dame as a facsimile of the originalSchoolgirl, 12, had \u0026#39intense social media activity\u0026#39 days before she hanged herself, coroner rulesBernie Sanders among top one per cent of US earners, newly released tax returns showNotre-Dame fire: Cathedral \u0026#39was 15 minutes from destruction\u0026#39 say officials as Macron pledges to rebuild it in five years Comment: My ided country has been united by the flames of Notre-DameHow Notre-Dame\u0026#39s relics were rescued by hero priest who rushed into flamesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"london burlesque festival pictures","story":"Founded in 2007 by Chaz Royal, London Burlesque Festival is Europe\u0027s first festival dedicated to the revival of Burlesque.

I am very grateful for that, as I grew up in a family that lived paycheck to paycheck and I know the stress of economic insecurity.”The 2018 tax return, the most recent released, showed Mr Sanders and his wife Jane O’Meara Sanders receiving an income of $561,293. That puts the Sanders in the top 1 per cent of US earners, according to the Economic Policy Institute, which said families receiving more than around $422,000 a year were in that bracket. About $393,000 of the Sanders’s 2018 earnings came from book income. The pair reported giving $19,000 to charity – though other charitable gifts may have gone undeclared.The pair paid an effective tax rate of 26 per cent in 2018, according to the Sanders campaign. Mr Sanders said in his statement: I consider paying more in taxes as my income rose to be both an obligation and an investment in our country.I will continue to fight to make our tax system more progressive so that our country has the resources to guarantee the American Dream to all people.”Bernie Sanders ran Hillary Clinton close in the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination race, but ultimately fell shortMr Sanders, a Vermont senator, sprung to worldwide prominence when he ran a closer than expected race against Hillary Clinton for the Democrats’ 2016 presidential nomination. He ended up losing to Mrs Clinton but his unashamed left-wing policy pitch inspired scores of young Americans and drew comparisons to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader. Shortly after the 2016 election, Mr Sanders’ book Our Revolution: A Future To Believe In was published. It was eventually translated into five languages. A young-adult book called Bernie Sanders\u0027 Guide to Political Revolution was published the following year and another, titled Where We Go From Here, came out last year.Given Mr Sanders’ left-wing policy program – free government-funded healthcare for all, a $15 minimum wage, no tuition fees – he has been challenged to square his new-found wealth with his political stance. “I wrote a best-selling book,” Mr Sanders said in an interview with The New York Times last week. “If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.”During a town hall debate run by Fox News on Monday, Mr Sanders acknowledged he had increased his income by publishing a book and declined to apologise. “I guess the president watches your network a little bit, right? Mr Sanders said to the moderators. Hey, President Trump. My wife and I just released 10 years. Please do the same.Mr Sanders had held up publishing his full tax returns during his 2016 bid for the White House, releasing just his 2014 return. Leading rivals for the 2020 nomination have released years of tax returns. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator, has released 10 years’ worth and Kamala Harris, the California senator, has released 15 years of returns. Mr Trump is yet to release any of his tax returns, despite promising to do so during the 2016 presidential campaign once an audit was complete. Committees in the House of Representatives which are controlled by the Democrats are attempting to force their release with subpoenas. The White House is fighting the move. Please review our commenting policyNotre-Dame fire: How the blaze tore through ancient timbers, damaged walls and led to a race to save artworkTrust Me, series 2 episode 1, review: daft premise but the canny cast carry it throughUnder 18s to be barred from porn websites under age restrictions to be introduced within weeksThe Great British School Swap episode one review: exploitative culture clash show lacking in insight or emotional heftLibyan suspect in Yvonne Fletcher murder could be forced to give evidence in High Court actionComment: Where would we be now if Remain had won the referendum?Criminals to be handed clean slate under Sajid Javid plan to wipe minor offences when applying for jobsGrassroots Conservative chairmen planning no-confidence vote in Theresa May \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39You never imagine as a firefighter being called on to save Notre-Dame\u0026#39: the hero Parisians who saved their cathedralDigital blueprints and 1,300 oak trees: How Notre-Dame will be rebuiltRecord 70 per cent of Russians say Stalin played a positive role in their country\u0026#39s history Former Isil bride living freely in HamburgLocal council launches inquiry into councillor who used emojis to label rival a \u0026#34b***end\u0026#34 World watches as UK announces it will drop key childhood vaccine to two dosesDonald Trump \u0026#39shown pictures of children hospitalised by Novichok to persuade him to act against Russia\u0026#39Comment: It would be a travesty to rebuild Notre Dame as a facsimile of the originalSchoolgirl, 12, had \u0026#39intense social media activity\u0026#39 days before she hanged herself, coroner rulesNotre-Dame fire: Cathedral \u0026#39was 15 minutes from destruction\u0026#39 say officials as Macron pledges to rebuild it in five years Comment: My ided country has been united by the flames of Notre-DameHow Notre-Dame\u0026#39s relics were rescued by hero priest who rushed into flamesEU complains new Facebook rules will stop it running ads praising itselfWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000194091890_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqU2Nkv2NBUPc_0jJHvTFVmdsqMpDJkJI06L3nviO7tE4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"former isil bride living freely hamburg","story":"Women in a Syrian displacement campA former Isil bride who was married to one of the jihadist group’s senior leaders has returned to Germany and is living freely in Hamburg, it has emerged.Omaima Abdi was married to Dennis Cuspert, a former rapper also known as Deso Dogg who was Isil’s chief German spokesman until his death in January 2018.She was tracked down in Hamburg by an Arabic television news channel, which also broadcast mobile phone pictures in which she is seen carrying a gun in Syria and posing with Cuspert.The 34-year-old Abdi now lists her occupation on Linked In as translator and event manager and reportedly no longer wears a hijab or headscarf.In a case that is bound to be compared to that of the British Isil bride Shamima Begum, questions are being asked over how Ms Abdi was able to return to Germany without being detained and why she has not faced any prosecution for her time with Isil. Ms Abdi was traced in Hamburg by Jenan Moussa, a Lebanese reporter for Dubai’s al-Aan television network. In her report, Ms Moussa said she was passed data obtained data from the former Isil bride\u0027s mobile phone by an unnamed party.Photo Dispatch: The final days of the Isil caliphateAs well as extensive images from her time in Syria, the phone data included an address in Hamburg where Ms Abdi still lives.“I couldn’t imagine anyone with her story was running around freely in Germany,” Ms Moussa, who has not commented on how she obtained the phone data, told Germany’s Spiegel magazine. German prosecutors on Tuesday declined to comment publicly on the case or confirm whether Ms Abdi had ever been under investigation.But according to unconfirmed German media reports they have wanted to build a case against her for some time but have been unable to uncover sufficient evidence.Under German law, Isil brides cannot be prosecuted unless it can be proved they also took part in the jihadist group’s activities.The mobile phone photographs obtained by al-Aan television and published for the first time include images of Ms Abdi wearing a gun while she visited a restaurant in an Isil-controlled part of Syria.They also include images of her son, who was a toddler at the time, dressed in Isil fatigues and playing with a handgun, as well as images of Ms Abdi sharing family life with Cuspert, who was a senior figure in Isil.Isil Rise and fall of a caliphateDisturbingly, they also include propaganda images of heavily armed jihadist fighters superimposed on pictures of the Eiffel Tower and the Reichstag building in Berlin.It remains unclear whether the new images are enough to mount a prosecution against Ms Abdi. According to German media reports, she is constantly monitored by the country’s intelligence services.Moussa tracked down details of Ms Abdi’s life and how she came to be an Isil bride, including how she was married to two senior Isil figures who both died and left her a widow.Born in Germany to a family of Tunisian heritage, Ms Abdi first began to show signs of radicalisation in 2011. In 2012 she travelled to Frankfurt where she met a number of Islamic extremists including Nader Hadra, who she married later the same year.Hadra later travelled to Syria to join Isil, and in January 2015 Ms Abdi flew out with her children to be reunited with him, travelling via Turkey.It is clear the German authorities were aware of the move. The mobile phone images include a picture of a letter from the German social security office in March 2015 informing Ms Abdi that her benefits had been ended because she had “moved to a foreign country (Syria)”.Hadra was killed just six weeks after Ms Abdi’s arrival in Syria during the battle for Kobane. She later became close to Cuspert, who had been a friend of Hadra’s and the two married in 2015.Ms Abdi left Syria in 2016 and returned to Germany. The reason for her return is not clear.Notre-Dame fire: How the blaze tore through ancient timbers, damaged walls and led to a race to save artworkTrust Me, series 2 episode 1, review: daft premise but the canny cast carry it throughUnder 18s to be barred from porn websites under age restrictions to be introduced within weeksThe Great British School Swap episode one review: exploitative culture clash show lacking in insight or emotional heftLibyan suspect in Yvonne Fletcher murder could be forced to give evidence in High Court actionComment: Where would we be now if Remain had won the referendum?Criminals to be handed clean slate under Sajid Javid plan to wipe minor offences when applying for jobsGrassroots Conservative chairmen planning no-confidence vote in Theresa May \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39You never imagine as a firefighter being called on to save Notre-Dame\u0026#39: the hero Parisians who saved their cathedralDigital blueprints and 1,300 oak trees: How Notre-Dame will be rebuiltRecord 70 per cent of Russians say Stalin played a positive role in their country\u0026#39s history Local council launches inquiry into councillor who used emojis to label rival a \u0026#34b***end\u0026#34 World watches as UK announces it will drop key childhood vaccine to two dosesDonald Trump \u0026#39shown pictures of children hospitalised by Novichok to persuade him to act against Russia\u0026#39Comment: It would be a travesty to rebuild Notre Dame as a facsimile of the originalSchoolgirl, 12, had \u0026#39intense social media activity\u0026#39 days before she hanged herself, coroner rulesBernie Sanders among top one per cent of US earners, newly released tax returns showNotre-Dame fire: Cathedral \u0026#39was 15 minutes from destruction\u0026#39 say officials as Macron pledges to rebuild it in five years Comment: My ided country has been united by the flames of Notre-DameHow Notre-Dame\u0026#39s relics were rescued by hero priest who rushed into flamesEU complains new Facebook rules will stop it running ads praising itselfWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/16/TELEMMGLPICT000003720377_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaoMNi4kgGP0fXgnKocWr3BfAZ3Qug6_j8804FaqEzrs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judge reveals summoned jury duty case","story":"Judge Keith Cutler was selected for jury service at Salisbury Crown CourtA senior judge has revealed that he was called for jury service and denied exemption despite telling officials he was actually the judge presiding over the case.Judge Keith Cutler, the resident judge of Winchester and Salisbury since 2009, let the jury on his latest trial in on his surprise when he was called upon to do his public duty as a juror for a case later this month.Speaking at Salisbury Crown Court after Neil Sutherland was acquitted on Tuesday of murdering a former soldier with a baseball bat, the senior circuit judge told how he had been denied exemption, despite declaring himself as the judge in charge of the same case.Judge Cutler replied to the summons explaining that he was already presiding over the pending trial, but he was told to appeal to the Jury Central Summoning Bureau directly.He said: I was selected for jury service here at Salisbury Crown Court for a trial starting 23rd April.I told the Jury Central Summoning Bureau that I thought I would be inappropriate seeing I happened to be the judge and knew all the papers.They wrote back to me, they picked up on the fact I was the judge but said \u0027your appeal for refusal has been rejected but you could apply to the resident judge\u0027.“I told them \u0027I am the resident judge\u0027. I had to phone them up and they realised it was a mistake.Judge Cutler served as coroner for the inquest of Mark Duggan who was shot by police in August 2011 and he has served as president of the Council of Circuit Judges.Judges are not automatically exempt from jury service in England and Northern Ireland and Judge Cutler said he would have happily served as a juror in the appropriate circumstances.I would have liked to have done the jury service to see what it was like and whether I would have liked the judge,” he added.A guide to jury summons issued by the Department of Justice states: The normal expectation is that everyone summoned for jury service will serve at the time for which they are summoned.However, it is recognised that there will be occasions when it is not reasonable for a person to serve at the time for which they are summoned.Please review our commenting policyNotre-Dame fire: How the blaze tore through ancient timbers, damaged walls and led to a race to save artworkTrust Me, series 2 episode 1, review: daft premise but the canny cast carry it throughUnder 18s to be barred from porn websites under age restrictions to be introduced within weeksThe Great British School Swap episode one review: exploitative culture clash show lacking in insight or emotional heftLibyan suspect in Yvonne Fletcher murder could be forced to give evidence in High Court actionComment: Where would we be now if Remain had won the referendum?Criminals to be handed clean slate under Sajid Javid plan to wipe minor offences when applying for jobsGrassroots Conservative chairmen planning no-confidence vote in Theresa May \u0026#39within weeks\u0026#39\u0026#39You never imagine as a firefighter being called on to save Notre-Dame\u0026#39: the hero Parisians who saved their cathedralDigital blueprints and 1,300 oak trees: How Notre-Dame will be rebuiltRecord 70 per cent of Russians say Stalin played a positive role in their country\u0026#39s history Former Isil bride living freely in HamburgLocal council launches inquiry into councillor who used emojis to label rival a \u0026#34b***end\u0026#34 World watches as UK announces it will drop key childhood vaccine to two dosesComment: It would be a travesty to rebuild Notre Dame as a facsimile of the originalDonald Trump \u0026#39shown pictures of children hospitalised by Novichok to persuade him to act against Russia\u0026#39Schoolgirl, 12, had \u0026#39intense social media activity\u0026#39 days before she hanged herself, coroner rulesBernie Sanders among top one per cent of US earners, newly released tax returns showNotre-Dame fire: Cathedral \u0026#39was 15 minutes from destruction\u0026#39 say officials as Macron pledges to rebuild it in five years Comment: My ided country has been united by the flames of Notre-DameHow Notre-Dame\u0026#39s relics were rescued by hero priest who rushed into flamesWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 16 april 2019","story":"A boat is placed in the centre of the traffic junction as Environmental campaigners block Oxford Circus during a coordinated protest by the Extinction Rebellion group in London, England.

His popularity slipped several points after an unpopular pension age hike was announced last year.Only 19 per cent of those polled thought Stalin, who headed the Soviet Union for more than two decades until his death in 1953, had played a “more negative” or “definitely negative” role.Respondents were almost evenly split on whether the human casualties under the iron-fisted leader were “justified” by the “grand goals and results” achieved. While 15 million were killed in prisons and labour camps under Stalin, a state commission estimated after the Soviet collapse, in recent years the “generalissimo” has seen a gradual rehabilitation. In school books and on state television is now often given credit for cracking down on corruption, industrialising the country and defeating the Nazis.A survey last autumn found that 47 per cent of people aged 18-24 did not know about Stalin\u0027s repressions.As Russia seeks to reassert itself abroad, Mr Putin has stressed the USSR\u0027s military strength and geopolitical triumphs far more than the atrocities it committed.“The excessive demonisation of Stalin is one of the ways, one of the routes of attacking the Soviet Union and Russia,” he told Hollywood director Oliver Stone in a 2017 interview, arguing that the UK had built monuments to a “dictator and tyrant” in commemorating Oliver Cromwell. Communist supporters line up to place flowers at Stalin\u0026#39s grave on Red Square on the anniversary of his death in MarchBusts of Stalin have been appearing ever more frequently, including several at the initiative of the Russian military historical society led by the country\u0027s culture minister. The major Siberian city of Novosibirsk will allow a monument to Stalin to be placed in front of the local communist party headquarters on Victory Day next month. The head of one nearby village has already named all 25 of its streets after the leader, producing addresses like “5th side street of Generalissimo I.V. Stalin”. Last month, a man who yelled “burn in hell” at a bust of Stalin at his Red Square grave while communists were commemorating his death was immediately detained by police. Gennady Zyuganov, long-time head of the communist fraction in Russia\u0027s rubber-stamp parliament, said after the latest poll Stalin was the “embodiment of the justice that the people increasingly need”.Surveys in 2012 and 2017 named him the “most outstanding” figure in history among Russians, just ahead of Mr Putin.The last Russian emperor Nicholas II, who was sainted by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000, narrowly edged out Stalin as the most likeable leader in a poll last year. Please review our commenting policyNotre-Dame fire: How the blaze tore through ancient timbers, damaged walls and led to a

More than 1.5sq km of Saddleworth Moor was ablaze in the early hours of Wednesday morning after the UK’s hottest winter day on recordAlastair Cook after he received his knighthood at Buckingham PalaceTeachers are backing a motion to ballot members over a possible boycott of the Sats exams – which are taken by 10- and 11-year-olds in Year 6. And parents are due to march on Westminster next week over the government’s new baseline tests for pupils in the first few weeks of reception. Speaking in Liverpool, Mr Corbyn said: “Sats and the regime of extreme pressure testing are giving young children nightmares and leaving them in floods of tears. “I meet teachers of all ages and backgrounds who are totally overworked and overstressed. These are dedicated public servants. It’s just wrong.”NEU\u0026nbspmembers gave Jeremy Corbyn a standing ovation at their conference in LiverpoolHis announcement comes after a poll of teachers last year revealed children had nightmares and were sick from anxiety after tougher Sats.In 2017, the government announced that statutory Sats exams for seven-year-olds would be phased out and replaced with a baseline assessment in reception beginning in 2020. Despite calls for Sats exams for 10- and 11-year-olds to be abolished, the Department for Education decided to keep them in place.\u0026nbspThe exams\u0026nbspare used to hold schools to account.Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “Jeremy Corbyn gets it – he recognises the damage that a test-driven system is doing to children and schools he understands what needs to change he sets out ideas for education which will make sense to parents and teachers.“The NEU has long advocated an assessment system that has the trust of teachers and school communities – one that will support children’s learning and\u0026nbspraise standards of attainment in our schools.”Parents told that ill children must sit Sats exams as boycott loomsPaul Whiteman, general secretary of heads’ union NAHT, said: “In reality, Sats do not tell teachers or parents anything they didn’t already know about their child or school, but have the negative unintended consequences of distracting from teaching and learning and narrowing the focus of the curriculum.”The More Than a Score coalition, which represents 18 education and parents’ organisations, said: “We’ve now reached a tipping point as parents, teachers, heads, education experts and politicians agree: the current testing regime makes no sense and is damaging for pupils, teachers and schools.“Parents of children preparing for Year 6 Sats in just a few weeks’ time will have seen the effects for themselves: a narrowed curriculum and unnecessary pressure on pupils and teachers. “Meanwhile, parents of pre-schoolers are now facing the prospect of four-year-olds being tested in English and maths when they start school from next year.”Speaking about Labour’s announcement on Sats, schools standards minister Nick Gibb\u0026nbspsaid: “These tests have been part of school life since the 90s. They have been pivotal in raising standards in our primary schools. That’s why Labour governments led by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown supported them.”“Abolishing these tests would be a terrible, retrograde step. It would enormously damage our education system, and undo decades of improvement in children’s reading and maths. “Labour plan to keep parents in the dark. They will prevent parents from knowing how good their child’s school is at teaching maths, reading and writing.

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist? Nick Gibb, the schools minister, argues that the exams raise standards and improve children’s reading and maths before secondary school.Ministers say that pressure shouldn\u0027t be\u0026nbspplaced on\u0026nbspchildren\u0026nbspas the exams are there only\u0026nbspto measure schools.Created with Sketch.Back to school: children attend class around the world Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A student stands in the ruins of one of his former classroomsUnicefClarke for UNSitan Doumbia, 5, plays with her friends at the Early Childhood Development Center in Mali330 Democratic Republic of the CongoTeacher Edouard Kabukapua, 28, accompanies his students as they sing on their way to their class in a temporary tent school in Mulombela village, KasaÃ¯ region, Democratic Republic of the Congo.

And the pressure has been passed down to the kids.Some argue that abolishing Sats would also make it harder for parents to know how good schools are at teaching core subjects, with these\u0026nbspresults used in league tables and Ofsted ratings.However, many parents are willing to have less information in order to save their child from the tougher assessments that leave many feeling stressed out.Standing up in front of teachers\u0026nbspwho have been disillusioned with the primary school testing regime for years\u0026nbspand calling for the abolition of exams\u0026nbspis an easy gig for Corbyn. What will be harder is finding an alternative assessment system that both parents and schools will back.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ve adapted to change before. They must do so againClick to followThe IndependentIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics, the Tories must lead the way, both in tone and contentThe Parliamentary Conservative Party notoriously has two default settings: complacency or panic.The pressure of the Brexit process has moved the dial significantly towards the latter, although one should never underestimate the capacity of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership skills to encourage Conservatives into the former.For anyone who thinks long-term, though, the departure of colleagues with stinging remarks about destroying the Conservative Party should be worrying. Almost the worst thing about the early days of the Independent Group was that the Labour defectors were clearly distraught about leaving their political home, while the Tory defectors looked exultant.Is this the beginning of the end?I strongly believe that it need not be, and indeed will not be as long as the post-Brexit Conservative Party pours as much energy into its domestic policies and widening its base as it has into European affairs.Created with Sketch.Both sides of Brexit: Remain and Leave through a lens Show all 29Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Remain protesters with pro-EU banners sit next to a Leave campaigner in Trafalgar square during the People’s Vote march in London.

In the late 1990s it looked as though Conservatives were destined for extinction in Scotland and Wales. The party now has significant representation in both countries, allowing it once again to become the truly national UK-wide party it has always been.Also over the last decade the party in parliament has begun to look much more like modern Britain in all its variety. It seems overwhelmingly likely that, just as the Conservatives were the first party to elect a woman leader, it will be the first party to elect one from a Bame background. Of course there is much more to do but the party has recognised the problem of looking and sounding too narrow and is taking effective steps to address it.Conservatives would be ‘wiped out’ in snap general election – Tory MPBefore I seem to sink back into the mode of complacency I should acknowledge that real problems exist. The membership of the party is not even representative of Conservative voters, let alone the wider country. It is much smaller than it used to be. It is possible to exaggerate how much older the Conservative Party membership is than Labour’s, but it is still true that some 44 per cent of Conservative members are over 65, compared with 30 per cent for other parties.There is also a whiff of intolerance in the air inside the party which is new and dangerous. Deselection is a word which in the past has only been associated with the unpleasant actions of the hard left of the Labour Party. If it becomes a habitual threat from the hard right of the Tory party it will signify a move away from being a party of government. It should be stamped out immediately.But to address any of these long-term issues requires progress on Brexit, and then a move on to other matters. We all know that the Brexit vote represented a myriad of discontents, some of them shared across the west since 2008, and some specific to this country. What the Conservative Party needs to do is address the various sources of discontent.Ashdown and Lord Kinnock (PA)This is more difficult than previously. In 2005, after our third election defeat in a row, I gave the Macmillan Lecture for the Tory Reform Group and observed that: “If the Conservative Party does not like modern Britain it is unlikely that modern Britain will warm to the Conservative Party.”Much of that problem was solved by David Cameron and his modernisation programme. The current leadership faces the even more intractable problem that modern Britain no longer seems to like itself. The tone of political discourse ranges from the harsh to the disgraceful. Violent language is common. Disgracefully, and occasionally tragically, this spills over into physical violence.How Europe became the funeral pyre for Tory leadersIf we are to move on from the current toxic politics the Conservative Party in its post-Brexit phase needs to lead the way, both in tone and content. The tone required is one of respect not just for each other and our varying views but for our political opponents as well. This is not easy.The current Labour Party is determined to establish a false and unpleasant narrative: that the (necessary) period of austerity after 2008 means that every inidual Conservative politician is complicit in creating poverty and misery and is therefore beyond the pale. It is very tempting to respond in kind, but this temptation should be resisted.Raising the debate from the gutter is the right thing to do and will in the long run benefit those who do it, as long as the underlying discontents are addressed at the same time.Long ago\u0026nbspRab\u0026nbspButler said he was keen to make it ‘perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory’. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a ToryInevitably, after the financial crash of 2008 and subsequent global recession, there are no lack of problems requiring a hard-headed but warm-hearted solution, in the best tradition of One-Nation Conservativism. As we move out of the austerity period we have the chance to provide a mixture of targeted increases in public spending and tax cuts which will provide future prosperity both for the country and the party.That chance will only come if there is a successful Brexit settlement which releases the large amount of stalled investment that has been waiting for certainty but if and when this happens, the opportunities are huge.In politics and economics maths is everything. If your economy grows at 2.5 per cent a year, you can afford to increase public spending, cut taxes, and have some left over to reduce long-term debt. If it grows at 1.5 per cent a year, which would probably be our fate if Brexit goes wrong, you don’t have enough flexibility.Although sorting Brexit is therefore the first and overwhelming priority, the choices the party makes about where it concentrates next are key.This is not the place for detailed policy blueprints, but the areas for activity are pretty clear. We need to meet the needs of those parts of the country which did not benefit from the finance-driven globalisation of the 1990s. The Northern Powerhouse was a good idea and needs to be made a reality. Coastal towns, and more generally medium-sized towns with no nearby big city, have special needs.Created with Sketch.

The unfairly neglected Industrial Strategy needs to be at the heart of what the government both does and talks about between now and 2022. If we get right our policy towards artificial intelligence, 5G, electric vehicles, and other new technology, then the effects of Brexit will be relatively small. The same is of course true on the downside.If it is to meet present\u0026nbspchallenges, the party will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevanceThis is not to neglect the traditional areas of policy dispute. Just as health now has a growing budget and a proper long-term plan, I would like to see education treated in the same way. By education I don’t just mean school and universities, but also the FE and apprenticeship sectors, which deserve more attention than ever before.In social policy, I think grasping the nettle on social care funding should be the start of a much deeper process of rethinking our attitude to the over-60s to recognise the fact that people commonly live to be 90 or older and are fitter and healthier than ever before into their 70s. We should stop assuming that everyone over the age of 65 is frail and just wants a quiet life. Staying in the world of work is not just better for the economy, it is usually better for the inidual.There is no shortage of challenges, and happily no shortage of thinking about them. Both my colleagues in parliament, and centre-right thinktanks new and old, are fertile in creating policy ideas. For the country’s sake, these ideas need a successful political party to make them real. Far from being defunct, the Conservative Party is needed as much as ever to shape Britain in the post-Brexit world.Tory Party being ‘hollowed out’ by ex-Ukip members, John Major sayIf it is to meet this challenge, it will need to retain, or in some cases regain, its sense of optimism. It is all too easy for Conservatives to become grumpy pessimists. That way lies irrelevance. It also needs to regain the mantle of the party that offers opportunity to all.Millennials have been foisted with an unfair reputation as entitled snowflakes. They are having to cope with a fast-changing world of work which offers less security than their parents enjoyed, and a significantly more difficult route to settled prosperity in their own home. Most of them want that, and the political prize for offering it is huge.These substantive policy areas will be much more likely to win first-time voters than any improvement to campaigning techniques on social media, necessary though they are.At the same time, leading Conservatives need to take every chance to show that being a Conservative does not in some way mark you out from the rest of the country. Corbyn’s Labour Party is determined to pursue this idea, and it needs refuting. Long ago Rab Butler said he was keen to make it “perfectly possible to be literate, rational, well-informed and a Tory”. Today we should be equally keen to make it perfectly possible to be decent, compassionate, outward-looking and a Tory.These various policy suggestions involve recasting some traditional Conservative values, including opportunity for all, home ownership and support for business, to make them fit for the mid-21st century.This will allow the party to follow one of the wise points made by another Tory guru, Keith Joseph, in the 1970s, when he said that instead of the centre ground, politicians should seek the common ground. It is a subtle but important difference, in that it means that instead of triangulating between the existing extremes, you identify new areas of concern which the people may have reached before the politicians.The Brexit vote showed that there was indeed a disconnect between political conventional wisdom and the desires of the British people. Throughout its history the Conservative Party has been sensitive to such changes, and adept at adapting to them.It needs to do so again.Damian Green has been the Conservative MP for Ashford since 1997 and was the first secretary of state and minister for the Cabinet Office from June to December 2017Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

than women and be safe to drive, when in reality it is down to a variety of factors such as weight, medications and diet.A further 1 million over 55s believe eating a large meal before driving would negate the effects of alcohol and 552,000 believe that older people are safer drivers and that it is therefore less dangerous if they drink and drive.Speeding car flies into air and crashes into top floor of buildingAnalysis of Department for Transport (DfT) data by Direct Line has revealed 26 per cent of all road accidents in 2017 (45,500 out of 175,000) involved older drivers.Commenting on the figures, Steve Barrett, head of motor insurance at Direct Line, said: “It is clear that younger drivers are not the only offenders when it comes to drink driving.“Motorists may become complacent as they get older because they feel they are so experienced behind the wheel, but tolerance levels differ hugely depending on body type.\u0026nbsp“Just because someone doesn’t feel drunk or is only

per cent.The Independent previously reported how “baby boomers”, all now over the age of 50, have shown the fastest rise of alcohol and drug misuse over the past 15 years.Data from the British Crime Survey shows the number of self-reported driving by people who think they have been over the legal alcohol limit at least once in the last 12 months.\u0026nbspBetween 2010 and 2018, there was a reduction of nearly 50 per cent in the proportion of people aged 16-19 who took this risk. For people aged 50, it fell by only 11 per cent.Earlier this year, Swedish car maker Volvo announced it would install cameras and sensors in its vehicles from the early 2020s with the ability to monitor drivers for signs of being drunk or distracted and to intervene to prevent accidents.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

dismiss chances of legislation passing by 22 May – putting prime minister on course for ballot box disaster and fresh threat to her jobClick to followIndy PoliticsTheresa May has “no chance” of passing her Brexit deal in time to pull the UK out of the European parliament elections and avoid a likely devastating defeat, experts have concluded.Time has already effectively run out on attempts to ratify the agreement by 22 May, they say – despite the prime minister insisting talks with Labour can still deliver a compromise before the deadline.The verdict puts the Conservatives on course to lose most of their MEPs, polls suggest, as Leave voters protest at the failure to deliver Brexit, a disastrous result that would trigger huge pressure on Ms May to resign.The staging of the elections will also be a personal humiliation for the prime minister, who repeatedly told MPs they should not take place, three years after the Brexit referendum.More talks with Labour are planned, as No 10 claims the complex (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill – required to ratify EU withdrawal – can clear parliament before voters go to the polls on 23 May.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit

on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyBut two respected think tanks have told The Independent the timetable is a fantasy, with one suggesting it will take “several months” to approve the legislation, which could involve up to 100 votes.Unlike the simple meaningful vote, the full legislation will trigger lengthy and gruelling parliamentary trench warfare, with echoes of the bitter battles over the Maastricht\u0026nbspand Lisbon treaties.Approval of Maastricht took 41 days in 1993, while Lisbon required 25 days in 2008 – but there are only 17 sitting days planned before 22 May.Joe Owen, programme director at the Institute for Government, said: “It looks highly unlikely the government will be able to pass the (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill by the end of May, given the political challenge facing the prime minister.”Rudd could back Johnson for leader despite previous attacksPointing to huge controversies surrounding the Brexit orce bill, the Irish backstop and protecting EU citizens’ rights, he added: “All of these things will be open to amendment by backbenchers.”Dr Alan Wager, a researcher for the UK in a Changing Europe think tank, said: “It’s likely to take several months to pass the bill, given how long comparable legislation has taken to pass historically.Dr Wager predicted a flashpoint prompted by Remain MPs over a Final Say referendum, as well as Brexiteer anger over the deal, saying: “The government is going to be squeezed from both sides.”Addressing MPs last week, after a late-night Brussels summit agreed a further Brexit delay until 31 October, the prime minister insisted a rapid\u0026nbsppassage of the deal was still possible.“Let us then resolve to find a way through this impasse so that we can leave the European Union with a deal as soon as possible, so that we can avoid having to hold those European parliamentary elections,” she said.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, argued the predicted disaster for the Tories of asking voters to elect MEPs could still be averted.“I think the absolute priority for Theresa May is to get Brexit over the line before 23 May, so that we don’t end up fighting the European parliament elections,” he said.But Dr Wager pointed out the government had lost a staggering one-third of Brexit votes since last summer, with a further 60-100 likely when the bill arrives.And Mr Owen warned the bill could “end up so badly amended” that it contradicted the deal itself, leaving the European parliament unable to ratify it.Two polls have put the Tories on 16 per cent and 17 per cent for the May elections – far adrift of Labour on 24 and 29 per cent respectively.The party has never sunk so low since the 1832 Great Reform Act expanded the franchise, prompting Mr Hunt to admit the prime minister could be forced out of No 10 by such a result.Kosovo president says EU will ‘lose a lot of substance’ after BrexitDonald Tusk is right: Britain needs time for a final say referendumPelosi: No UK-US trade deal if Good Friday underminedDonald Tusk says Brexit can be stopped: ‘We need dreamers’May ‘must appoint deputy’ for next Brexit stage or repeat blundersA government sourced admitted to The Independent that Labour will be tempted to allow the talks to run into the sand\u0026nbspbecause of the predicted heavy losses for the Conservatives.Ministers have floated bringing forward the bill before a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspto allow agreed changes to be legally embedded, but this tactic also brings huge risk.If the legislation is voted down before the stage of debating amendments, Ms May would be forced to prorogue parliament and start a new session, threatening the fracturing alliance with the Democratic Unionist Party.The cross-party talks remain on the brink of collapse, having failed to resume this week between the politicians because of a lack of progress made by officials.Jeremy Corbyn said his team had pressed “very robustly” for a customs union, but Ms May was “dithering” under pressure from her party’s right wing.“The government doesn’t appear to be shifting the red lines because they’ve got a big pressure in the Tory party that actually wants to turn this country into a deregulated low-tax society which will do a deal with Trump,” he said, on a visit to the northwest of England.Institute for GovernmentUK in a changing europeThe latest news on

It is not a good situation, for the EU or for us in Kosovo.”The president\u0026nbspwas speaking about these troubled times from the viewpoint of his part of the continent. He is on a rocky road to ensuring that there is not a return to the Balkan wars – a conflict of death, atrocities, mass rapes and ethnic cleansing. The violence shocked Europe, which thought such savage strife was stuff of\u0026nbspthe past.Now the former adversaries, Serbia and Kosovo, are being urged by the west to draw a line under a simmering feud that has threatened to reignite.The leaders of the two states – Thaci and Aleksandar Vucic – both viewed in the past as fiercely unbending nationalists, have held talks, most recently at the annual Munich Security Conference. Another round of negotiations is expected to be held in the near future.Serbia tells citizens to avoid travel to UK because of ‘major chaos’There is a general agreement from both sides that membership of the European Union is pivotal to achieving long-term peace and, in the case of Kosovo, joining Nato\u0026nbsptoo.“The circumstances we face in Kosovo, the only future, the only way forward, is membership of the European Union, there is no doubt about that,” maintained Thaci during a visit to London.“As Kosovo we will do all our duties, tasks, to deserve to be a Nato member and an EU member. We want eventually to see open borders within the EU, with Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia, everywhere in the region. Regarding Nato, I think we are talking about a five to 10 year time frame, or perhaps even less, to join.”Sitting in the breakfast room of a hotel in Kensington, Thaci looks relaxed and urbane in a white and blue checked shirt and jeans. He was in combat fatigues the first time I met him, 20 years ago, drained and pale after a difficult military operation by the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which he led at the time.Britain will always remain a partner for Kosovo, whether it is a member or not. It was a key contributor to freedom and independence of KosovoIt was a time of ferocious fighting in Kosovo, and Nato bombing of Serbia, amid bitter recriminations between Russia and the west.Nato’s Kosovo Force (KFOR)\u0026nbspheaded by British Major General Mike Jackson, went into Kosovo, while Moscow sent in their own military contingent. Both sides were racing to secure the airport in the capital, Pristina, and the strategic advantage that went with it.There was a tense standoff, which I and other journalists witnessed in an evening of stormy rain, during which Jackson refused the order from his superior, the American General Wesley Clark, to block the runway to the Russians. Jackson’s\u0026nbspresponse is now part of the history of the conflict: “I am not going to start the Third World War for you.”Serbia threatens military action after Kosovo votes to create armyJackson had his way and a potentially incendiary confrontation was averted after the dispute reached the White House and Downing Street. They backed the British General over Clark, who was the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur).The Russians landed their flights, their troops went on a few symbolic joint patrols with Nato troops, and then withdrew. General Sir Mike Jackson went on to become the head of the British Army.Thaci had dinner with Jackson a few evenings before our meeting. “It was good to catch up and talk about old times – but also what’s going on now,” he says.“Britain will always remain a partner for Kosovo, whether it is a member or not. It was a key contributor to freedom and independence of Kosovo and we will always be grateful for this.”The Balkan wars led to bitter isions within Europe, with countries taking sides as Yugoslavia was dismembered: one example of the acrimony was that early German recognition of Croatian independence was widely portrayed as payback for the support given to Germany by the Ustashe during the Second World War.Sceptics have been saying that Trump would not care about the Balkans. In fact he has been very attentive, very supportiveA number of EU member states – Greece, Spain, Romania and Cyprus – have yet to recognise Kosovar independence. Thaci says: “There is disunity among some EU members on some things as we know, and there is disunity over Kosovo as well. International unity would really help with the dialogue we need to achieve an agreement (with Serbia). No doubt it would\u0026nbspspeed up the process.”Donald Trump has, rather unexpectedly, taken an interest in the issue, urging both sides to continue negotiating. “Sceptics have been saying that Trump would not care about the Balkans,” says\u0026nbspThaci. “In fact he has been very attentive, very supportive, but really he was following the policies of other presidents over Kosovo and the Balkans, Bush senior and junior, Clinton and Obama. Trump has sent two letters in two months, both to me and President Vucic of Serbia, with a very clear message to reach an agreement this year.”While Thaci was leading the KLA in Kosovo, and Nato warplanes were over Serbia, Vucic was minister for information in the government of Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade, railing against what he saw as victimisation of the Serbs by the west. He was also consumed by what the regime saw as “treachery within”, bringing in the draconian “Vucic law” to muzzle opposition media.Vucic is now viewed as a man the west can do business with and has been credited with reforming Serbian politics. He is facing some internal opposition, but was seen, for a long time, as the power-broker in his country. He remains the most influential politician.Aleksandar Vucic says Albanians ‘didn’t want to compromise’ over Kosovo armyI recall a dinner Vucic, then deputy prime minister, hosted six years ago in Belgrade for a small group of journalists on a day the Serbian government fell.He made a series of calls on his mobile phone in between\u0026nbspcourses, and, highly impressively in our view, had formed a new coalition administration by the end of the meal.“Mr Vucic definitely has changed, mainly because he has gone through difficult times because of his own mistakes,” says\u0026nbspThaci. “The regime he belonged to once was evil, a regime that did a lot of harm not only to Kosovo, Bosnia and Croatia, but even to Serbia itself.”\u0026nbsp“In 1998 and ’99,\u0026nbspVucic and I\u0026nbspwere in opposition. We won, he lost. Nevertheless, he is a legitimate leader, in Kosovo and Serbia, leaders that were voted by the citizens. We have all changed in a positive way, we’ve had to evolve. Now we don’t speak of war and conflict but speak of how to reach peace. There have been recent demonstrations\u0026nbspin Serbia, and there is a danger they might scare Vucic away from reaching an\u0026nbspagreement, but we hope not.\u0026nbspUnfortunately, there will always be those who are opposed to peace.“Vucic is a very difficult person to negotiate with, to have dialogue with. But I did not choose him as my counterpart, he didn’t choose me as his own counterpart, it’s the reality of these two sovereign countries.”Will those killed by Nato in Varvarin 19 years ago ever get justice?Thaci faces his own problems. The Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office, set up in the Hague in 2017, is investigating allegations of war crimes against a number of senior figures in the KLA, including the Kosovar president.Thaci insists he has nothing to fear. “As always, we will not run away, we will not shy away, we will face it and I am convinced we will overcome it with dignity and integrity,” he says.“I am personally very proud that I was one of the leaders of the Kosovo Liberation Army. There will always be voices that try to denigrate Kosovo or accuse Kosovo, smear Kosovo and me personally. But this doesn’t mean that I have any hesitation on what’s our way forward and how we should proceed forward. I believe in justice. What we should not allow to happen is for the history to be rewritten.”Of course the biggest hurdle is the past. But I think now really is our turn to reach a peace agreementThe Kosovar president accuses the international community of double standards: “We still didn’t even see trials, convictions for the genocide in Serbia carried out in Kosovo. And for us, it is a matter of concern, this silence of the international community towards these crimes. We have had as many as 15,000 civilians killed. Up to 20,000, it’s estimated, victims of sexual violence. There were around 200 massacres against civilians in Kosovo, all around Kosovo. International justice has failed to convict those responsible for these crimes.”But Thaci is also very aware of the burden of history in the Balkans.“Of course the biggest hurdle is the past, ” he says. “But if we look now broadly at the region, in particular after the recent agreement between Macedonia and Greece, the main issue, I think now really is our turn, Kosovo and Serbia, to reach a peace agreement. After all, dialogue has no alternative. It’s the only solution.”He adds: “Those of us who fought in the war need to think of a peaceful new future for the coming generations, that is important for us and for Europe.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But there are risks to this approach.Labour coming out for a second referendum would cost them in their Leave-voting seats and in the places they must win to form a government.Of the  seats in England and Wales that Corbyn needs to get a majority,  voted Leave. While  of his  most vulnerable seats backed Brexit.Corbyn’s other option is to do a deal with Mrs May.If he pushed her into accepting a customs union, then he would further ide the Tories.A deal would also mean Britain was out and that Corbyn could fight the next election on the domestic issues he cares about most.As one Cabinet Minister puts it: “There is an appeal for Corbyn to support something. He can create fissures within the Tory party, look serious, andhe becomes PM he doesn’t have to deal with all this crap.” But there are big risks to this approach, too.If Corbyn helped a Brexit deal over the line, there would almost certainly be more defections from the Labour Party.It would also produce a rallying cry for Chuka and Co.They would be able to tell pro-Remain votersthat Labour had betrayed them, that it could have stopped Brexit but chose not to.This is a finely balanced decision for Corbyn. But he doesn’t have long to make up his mind. If the Tories take a pasting in either next month’s local elections or the European elections, then Mrs May could be gone as Tory leader — replaced by a Brexiteer.This new Tory leader would immediately break off talks with Corbyn.If he wants to do a deal, he needs to DO IT SOON. Which way will he go Well, one of those involved tells me that the situation in the talks is “less negative than people think”. But the likelihood of these talks producing something remains low. What would make a deal attractive to Jeremy Corbyn would make it unpalatable to Theresa May.Another complication is that, as one Cabinet Minister points out, “It’s quite finely balanced that a May Corbyn deal could get through” the Commons as Labour MPs passionately in favour of a second referendum would vote against it, as would Tories who viscerally oppose a customs union.The depressing truth is that there is now a growing risk that the Tory party doesn’t deliver Brexit AND doesn’t stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting to Number . This would be an epic failure.Unless the Tory hold-outs decide to back the existing deal when they come back from their holidays, this danger will become increasingly real.CONSERVATIVE MPs are taking a second look at Boris Johnson.The former Foreign Secretary has more critics on the Tory benches than any other leadership contender.But the party’s precipitous fall in the polls is making Tories reconsider.If they are losing a quarter of their support to pro-Brexit parties, who is better placed to win those voters back than the man who led the Leave campaign  Boris’s campaign is more organised than it was.The arrival of the former MP James Wharton has helped and, as one of those on the team puts it, MPs are now “petried about their seats” and so more prepared to swallow their doubts about Boris.A decade ago, one of those who knows the Tory party best told me that the Tories would only turn to Boris when they were - down with  minutes to go.They now are three down and that means Boris is back in contention for the premiership.MRS MAY might still be in the post. But make no mistake, the Tory leadership contest is under way.We have now even got ministers saying on live TV who they will back when there’s a contest.This week, the Treasury Minister Mel Stride got  or so Tory MPs who want Michael Gove to run for leader together with their potential candidate for drinks.One of those present tells me it is increasingly likely that Gove will run.THE big decision on whether to press ahead with HS has to be taken in December.But with a change of Tory leader likely to happen before then, the project is in trouble.Scrapping the scheme would give any new PM billions to spend on other projects, such as better transport within and between northern cities and proper, digital infrastructure for the whole of the UK.There’ll be no shortage of candidates making this case come a Tory leadership contest.THE six-month Brexit extension is the wrong .It is neither short enough to force MPs to make up their minds about what they want, nor is it long enough to allow for a new Prime Minister and a general election campaign.Emmanuel Macron wanted to give Britain a short extension to force a decision, Angela Merkel favoured one long enough to give the UK time to come up with a new path. In the end, they compromised on this medium- extension.“Two potential routes out and they went to the middle one that delivers us to nowhere,” laments one Cabinet Minister.There is a real danger that the Brexit drt continues for another six months. This useless Parliament knows what it doesn’t want, but can’t say what it would actually accept.If this happens, Britain will end up back at the EU Council in October asking for a THIRD EXTENSION.This would be ridiculous. But one Secretary of State predicts that this is “where we’ll probably end up and at that point Macron’s view will probably prevail”.The French President might be so full of himself that you think he’s going to burst.But he’s right that only a HARD DEADLINE will force our MPs to make up their minds.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why stand in them If they are still serious that we are leaving the EU, why waste money fielding candidates as Tory MEPs Leavers will vote for Nigel Farage’s new outfit now anyway.THE sacking of housing expert Roger Scruton exposes a Tory Party and political system derailed by one website: Twitter.Scruton’s blunt remarks on Islamophobia, Hungary and the Chinese were quoted out of context by a left-wing journo who cynically stitched him up, then gloatingly toasted his downfall.But today’s Tories lack the spine to face down a leftie Twitter mob.So they indulge in virtue-signalling or desperate damage-limitation.Two hastily demanded Scruton be fired. One, without irony, said it was a “no-brainer”.Housing Secretary James Brokenshire brainlessly obliged. Their mistake became obvious too late.Politicians forever come a cropper with knee-jerk tweets.Like Tory chairman Brandon Lewis demanding Boris Johnson apologise for burka remarks most of Britain then backed.MPs are hooked on it and presumably imagine Britain is too.But political Twitter is a bubble, not the national conversation.A visit to any town or city outside the M would tell them that.And the Tories and Labour might then begin to grasp the white-hot rage felt by millions over the abysmal state of our politics and MPs’ infantile tribal games.WE hope the Tory ERG have a long, hard and sober think over their Easter break.They may want to be remembered as heroic holdouts against a softish Brexit.Butthe decision of .million ­people is overturned, and the Tories are ousted by hard-left extremists who inflict poverty on Britain, it will not be the Remainer MPs history recalls.Fair or not, it will be two dozen ERG members who had the sole viable Brexit deal in their grasp and threw it away.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In fact, it’s quite the opposite.For a start, not one recipient seems grateful.But more importantly, we are almost skint ourselves, so not exactly in a position to be flash with our cash.Are you aware that we have to pay £BILLION A YEAR simply in interest, servicing our own debt.So that is before we pay off any of the actual debt.So spending £billion a year on an ill-thought-through and poorly executed aid policy in the name of an arbitrary spending target seems nonsensical to me.A couple of recent examples of the kind of thing that some foreign aid is spent on once it has been allocated include fixing potholes in Pakistan and India and helping an all-female pop group dubbed the Ethiopian Spice Girls.But another story this week shines even more light on how misguided our foreign aid spending is.Auditors investigating the way £.billion was spent through charities found poor management practices and delays by the Department for International Development, which was described as “dithering”, risked completely wasting the money.The net result is that these foreign aid projects — which spend ten per cent of our aid budget — are “unlikely to achieve lasting change”.So not only are we throwing money we can not afford at a problem that is not ours, that money may as well be flushed away for all the good it is doing.How galling is that  Just to reiterate, we are talking about a whopping £.billion here — not just a few thousand quid.This is enough money to change lives here profoundly and on a very grand scale.But that brings me back to my first point: Why on earth are we giving away such a colossal amount of money when we really are not in a position to do so And it was recently revealed that more than million people in the UK are living in poverty.By the way, that figure includes .million children who are living below the breadline — and suffering badly as a result.More than half of them will not be able to get themselves out of poverty and will find themselves trapped in a cycle that goes on for years, according to a new measure for tracking poverty that has brought together specialists from across the political spectrum.The scary thing is that even a relatively comfortable income is no guarantee that people can meet basic material needs —that income is eaten up by unavoidable weekly outgoings.And this problem is getting worse, not better. By - the proportion of children living in relative povertyis on course to hit  per cent — exceeding the previous record high of  per cent in the early s.This could mean an extra one million children living in poverty in the next five years.In other words, we have a serious problem on our hands.Many people will no doubt blame austerity for the increase in poverty over the past few years. And yes, sure, it is true that the cuts and freezes to welfare and disability benefits have had an impact.But just imagine the ways in which £.billion could begin to make a massive material impact on the lives of poverty-stricken people in this country.I believe that we should reserve some money — a couple of billion, say — for overseas catastrophes, such as tsunamis.But other than that, let’s stop giving away money that could be much, much better spent at home.I KNOW Jeremy Kyle has interviewed some dubious characters over the years, but the biscuit was well and truly taken this week by Georgina Clarke.This -year-old mother is so obsessed with cosmetic surgery that she allowed her daughter Kayla, aged , to dance for, and sleep with, a “sugar daddy” who then paid for both of them to have plastic surgery.Why does an -year-old “need” cosmetic surgery, you may ask.Kayla blamed the pressures of social media, as well as glamorous celebrities such as the Kardashians for making her want bigger boobs and plumped-up lips.But instead of reassuring her daughter that she didn’t need surgery, this mother gave it her blessing.Georgina justied this to Jeremy by saying she found surgery “quite addictive”, and revealed – unsurprisingly –  she is still not happy with her own look.It’s easy to wonder whether that therefore means she’ll be encouraging her daughter to wine, dine and dance for a few more older men.As mothers, we are meant to give our daughters self-esteem and confidence, not encourage them to surgically “improve” themselves.And for a mother to encourage her daughter to fund that surgery, as well as her own, by sleeping with a dirty old man The only explanation is that her moral compass is severely and sadly lacking.I can still remember going to watch Grease when it came out the first time. I got dressed up in a boob tube and skin-tight trouserswhen I was all of nine years old.And I can’t wait to see the prequel, although I probably won’t wear the boob tube this time around.Mind you, I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said that over the years so... never say never.WE all have moments of fantasising about just how much better le would bewe won the lottery and never had to work again.But for all too many people, realising their wildest dreams with a win turns out to be a le change that’s incompatible with the le they have lived so far.Britain’s biggest lottery winners, Colin and Christine Weir, have turned out to be the latest lottery casualties.This week they announced they’re orcing – eight years after scooping the £million jackpot.Colin, , and Christine, , took home the EuroMillions British record in  and had been married for  years before their recent split.In fact, let’s all take a moment to count our lucky stars that we haven’t won the lottery this week.IT’S hard to believe that Lori Loughlin and her husband could be facing  years in prison and fines of more than a million dollars for allegedly bribing officials in a bid to get their daughters into the University of Southern Calornia.I mean, yes, I know that bribing your child’s way through university is dishonest, dishonourable and not at all admirable.But  years in prison for doing so That does seem a little harsh.Justice has been served and his mum was given a -month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a -day rehabilitation activity.Far worse, though, she has now lost her son, who has been adopted into another family. Thank God for adopters.A judge told the woman – who can’t be identied for legal reasons – that leaving her son in such a state was “reprehensible” and “goes against the instinct of any caring mother”, which is true.Anyone who becomes a parent needs to understand that kids are forever.I speak from experience, by the way – mine are  and  and there’s still no independence in sight.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over the past few weeks the EU has done just that to Theresa May.Only the dference is, we keep being flogged not because we tried to escape the EU but we failed to even TRY to escape.After all, we could have escaped with no deal on March , then again on April  and now we will have to put up with more floggings as we delay our departure until October.In the midst of this humiliating and embarrassing national failure, just when you think it can’t get worse, up pops the Chancellor glibly saying there will be a vote on holding another Brexit referendum and that the Government agree on a lot with Labour.This flies in the face of the fact that, in marginal seats around the country, Conservatives are aghast the Government wants to do a deal with Labour.Remember, this is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which wants a Customs Union, alignment with the EU single market and a second referendum.It’s BRINO — Brexit In Name Only.Worse, Corbyn’s brand of anti-British, Venezuelan-supporting Marxism is the single biggest threat to the UK’s future prosperity.Intriguingly, the Chancellor’s statement contradicts the Government’s previous view. After all, the Prime Minister used to say Corbyn wasn’t fit to be Prime Minister.The negotiating strategy it adopted has been aimed at trying to make an example of the UK to stop other countries thinking of leaving.At the heart of this has been their determination to insist on a deeply damaging set of proposals for the Northern Ireland border.It is these demands which have made it impossible to get a deal through the House of Commons. Those who believe in the importance of the union of the United Kingdom recognise the need to stand up for the rights of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK.The EU’s arrogant refusal to continue negotiating a better way forward, using alternative border arrangements, is a deliberate attempt to interfere in the nature of the UK.In this they are supported by French President Emmanuel Macron, whose somewhat pompous elitism is in stark contrast to his poll ratings — which have been so low you could slide them under a snake.Instead of confronting the EU, prepared to leave by rejecting its deal, the Prime Minister has instead taken a dangerous decision.This is to agree to the EU demand for a longer extension, up to October  — a further  days of membership.This isn’t just a delay until October, it comes with strings attached. The EU demands that we fight next month’s Euro elections.This will be an utter disaster.At a cost to taxpayers of more than £million, and around £billion each month in EU membership fees, we would elect MEP’s who would have to leave office when we leave the EU in October.These will be elections no one really wants and would go down in history as the most pointless and expensive electoral mistake.There was a time when the Prime Minister had the sympathy of the nation. People used to give her the benefit of the doubt.They recognised that in a Parliament stuffed with an overwhelming majority of anti-Brexit Remainers, and with a Remain-leaning Cabinet, it was dficult for her.Most people I have spoken to hung on to the pledge the PM made to leave the EU on March .They remembered her constant refrain that “no deal is better than a bad deal” and persuaded themselves such a pledge would be delivered on.That all changed when we didn’t leave on March . Gone is that sense of sympathy and trust and in its place is a growing sense of betrayal. The country is crying out for strong leadership.Yet it is not too late. We can, even at this eleventh hour, rediscover our belief in the UK as a self-governing nation, the world’s fth largest economy and one of the most influential.After all, despite all the Project Fear warnings, while the Eurozone is mostly in recession the UK’s economy is growing, employment is at a record high and youth unemployment at a near-record low.No, we don’t need to fear anything.The Prime Minister has already said she is stepping down. She needs to heed the concerns, including those of her MPs, and not let this drag out.What better legacy than one where she recognises the optimism of the British people when they voted to leave the EU.They instinctively know that our best days are ahead of us. Now is the time to refuse to be bullied by the EU any more — no more national humiliation.If the EU won’t change their deal, she should say the UK will simply leave.Now that’s a great legacy, Prime Minister. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is an emergency.In Parliament, Remainers outnumber Leavers. They need to understand the numbers that really count are the .million and the  per cent who voted Out — scope for a decent Leave party majority.Only a new pro-Brexit leader can start repairing the damage Mrs May has inflicted on ­voters’ trust and the stability of our political system. It might yet be too late.The genuine stock of sympathy and support commanded by this “bloody dficult woman” evaporated completely on March , her promised date for Brexit.All those reassuring poll leads over Labour turn out to be an illusion, bolstered by Ukip deserters who rallied to the Tories for the  ­General ­Election.They trusted Mrs May in  when she promised “Brexit means Brexit” and in  as she vowed “No Deal is better than a bad deal”. They don’t trust her any more.Both promises were flushed down the pan along with £.billion for a No Deal that never was — and the £million EU elections she insisted would never happen. Not to mention her £billion EU ransom.Staunch Conservatives are ticked off, disgusted to see Mrs May plotting with arch-enemy Corbyn to thwart Brexit, and Chancellor Phil Hammond backing a second referendum before delivering the first.Local party chiefs are on strike. Canvassers steer clear of angry voters. Donors have zipped their wallets and cash has dried up.

They must be changed.The new leader must be a Brexiteer, which leaves only three viable options — former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, ex-Brexit supremo Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove. Boris is the charismatic vote-winner MPs hope will save their seats. Raab is respected for walking out over Mrs May’s botched Chequers deal. Gove is gathering pace despite staying in Cabinet to back them.Whoever takes over will need to work fast to show the Tories are worth saving — with an emergency voter-friendly boost to the NHS and the fight against crime.They must take on “The Blob”, the anonymous civil ­service mandarins who think they really run Britain.Voters in the  referendum may have believed they were ­fighting faceless, undemocratic and unaccountable bureaucrats who run the EU.They now know Britain too is ruled by faceless, undemocratic and unaccountable bureaucrats who see ­ministers as “here today, gone tomorrow” ­politicians.Our “Yes Minister” civil ­service, not MPs, dictate what is possible, subject to Brussels rules, from schools to state spending, airports to agriculture.They see Britain not as the world’s fth-largest ­economy but a rather absurd ex-empire in managed decline.Margaret Thatcher briefly rooted out this noxious weed in the s.It ed with a vengeance under Tony Blair, breeding nitpicking mandarins such as the late Jeremy Heywood and now Mark Sedwill, who dictate Brexit terms from behind closed doors.Thanks to them, we rushed into Article , capitulated to Brussels, coughed up £billion and ruled out No Deal.

He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie.

The Mirror and Express are very dferent newspapers , with dferent readers and erging views over Brexit and who should lead our country. We’re poles apart on a whole host of issues. So,we can do it – so can you.We want you to sign up to agree to meet someone with dferent views. All you have to do is fill in a questionnaire, and we’ll do the rest. We will match you with someone who lives locally to you and who has dferent views. Then, we’re asking you to meet up – in a safe, public space – for a cup of tea or coffee, or for a walk – to chat.    Meet ups will take place on the weekend of June  – the third anniversary of Brexit. What better way to remember the day our nation ided, than by coming back together It’s the same weekend as the Great Get Together – the weekend Britain comes together in memory of Jo Cox for street parties and picnics. This year, we are partnering with the Jo Cox Foundation to try to bring even more people together. Our project is based on the pioneering My Country Talks set up by Zeit Online in Germany, which saw , people meet up across the country to talk about their dferences and find things in common.In the UK, when we asked people which issues are iding us most, Brexit is the clear winner at %. This is followed by immigration at %, left-right politics at % and wealth at %. But we know that isions are getting starker in all kinds of other ways. Between young and old, people in towns and cities, between England and Scotland, in Northern Ireland, in the debate over the rights of transgender people, and over welfare benefits, immigration and animal rights.  Reduced to the shouting of short, angry tweets and the snap of instant messaging, and modelling the childish yelling of Parliament’s debating chamber – it’s aswe’re forgetting how to talk to each other. Being polarised is paralysing not just our politics, but our nation. So, on June  we’re asking you to have a dficult conversation. We don’t want you to agree with the other person unless you want to. We just want you to converse – to really listen to each other. Maybe you will something in common, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll make a new friend, maybe you won’t. Maybe you’ll even want to tell us what happened when you met. Whatever happens, you will have shown the courage it takes to step outside your social bubble. Good luck.

Two people born  years apart, caught on opposite sides of the Brexit debate and in two dferent echo chambers. A passionate Remainer and Corbynista student from a big city, and a grandmother from a small town who votes Tory and can’t wait to Leave the European Union. So, no one knew exactly what would happen when the Mirror asked Ada Pratt, , a retired nurse, living in Littleborough, Greater Manchester, and Jon Lyons Connor, a -year-old student at Salford University, to be the first ever participants of our new project Britain Talks .Their challenge was to spend time in each other’s company and hold a genuine conversation. To discuss their dferences, but also find things in common. And to really listen to each other’s points of view. By the end, neither Ada or Jon had changed their views about Brexit or who is best running the country. But they had changed their views about each other. “I realise now, you’re not just one of the . million people who voted to Leave, you’re a real person,” Jon, who lives in Manchester’s hipster Northern Quarter, tells Ada. “You care about this country. People say older people voted Leave, they’ve messed things up. But you did it for your grandchildren, to make things better.”  Ada, who lives in a neat terrace in small town near Rochdale, at the foot of the Pennines, says she has enjoyed spending time with Jon. “It’s nice to meet a young person willing to listen to some old lady talking,” she says. “I don’t say he’s changed me. But it’s been nice to disagree without arguing. It’s hard to have a sensible conversation since the vote.” Born in Dundee, before moving to Littleborough as a young woman to find work, Ada voted for Brexit because believes it is best for the NHS, where she worked as a nursing sister for  years. She also worries about the EU’s lack of accountability, the power of the European Courts and a loss of sovereignty. And she feels services in her town are being stretched by immigration, but patronised by anyone who writes Brexiteers off as ill-informed or racist.Originally from Newton Heath, north Manchester, Jon is the son of a delivery driver and a bakery assistant. He discovered politics after being inspired by his history teacher at the local comprehensive – and is now Manchester’s youngest Labour councillor, and a student union officer.Jon sees the positive effect EU membership has had on Manchester every day in the redevelopment and investment that surrounds his rented city centre flat. And he worries le will get even harder for his community and generation after Brexit. During the referendum campaign he was shocked at the ision, even watching rival campaigners brawl in the street.  He says he was frequently told he was too young to know what he was voting for, and joined Britain Talks in the hope of having more productive conversations about Brexit – and understanding why people voted the way they did. “I was nervous,” he admits. “I didn’t want to be part of a slanging match, but talking over a brew or having a meal has made it about getting to know each other first.” The things Jon and Ada have in common were obvious from the first time they met. Ada was wearing a bee-themed scarf to commemorate the Manchester arena attack, while Jon has a bee tattoo on his wrist in solidarity with the families.Both describe themselves as “ordinary, working class people” trying to make sense of an extraordinary situation. During their meetings, they also discovered they shared a love of Netflix crime dramas, takeaways, pride in the NHS and in their families. Both are prudent and house proud with busy, sociable lives – days and nights spent helping others. Ada volunteers with homeless people and Jon works hard as a councillor to support local people. “We have quite a lot in common, more than you’d think,” Jon says. “We both care about where we live and want the best for our city and country - we just have dferent ideas about what happens next. I share some of the pride Ada has about where she’s from. It’s just that for me, it’s about being a Mancunian, then British, then European.” Whether it was a first, slightly nervous meeting over cheese and pickle sandwiches served on china plates in Ada’s immaculate terraced home, or a talking over endless hot tea in Jon’s new build city centre flat – it was clear they both love to talk. They will never agree on whether or not we should leave the EU, but they leave with a deeper understanding of each other’s points of view and a mutual respect.  “I know why you voted how you did, I know where your ideas were coming from,” Ada tells Jon. “I’ve learnt more about where EU money goes, what it does in the city, no-one ever really said that before. I’m shocked at how expensive it is to live in Manchester and how mature Jon is. Young people don’t always have it easy, I can see that. Jon is a lovely person, but I don’t think I’d want to be young now. “He has voted based on what he believes in, he’s done the research, he really has. But I don’t think that much will change when we’re out, we will adapt, we’ll find ways to do things like we did before we joined. I remember that. Jon doesn’t. I hope I’ve reassured him it will be okay.” Both say stepping out of their comfort zone, where most of those they know share their views, has been important – and hard to achieve without a project like Britain Talks.  “Spending time with Ada has given me insights I didn’t have before,” Jon says. “Being able to talk without all the shouting, with respect, means we’ve actually shared our opinions and where those opinions come from - what we’ve based them on - and that feels really important.” * Will you join Britain Talks  Start your journey by answering the question below...

A spokesman said it had not happened for years”, and had not been tolled to mark the Grenfell Tower fire or the   bombing. “We’d have to go back into the archives to find an occasion,” he said.  Meanwhile, Mrs May has also offered a message of solidarity with the people of Paris and offered to help “wherever we can” with the reconstruction of the Cathedral. The Prime Minister said: Notre Dame is one of the most beautul buildings in the world - a symbol of France and the French people, and cherished across the globe. The images of destruction we saw last night were truly heart-rending. To underline our solidarity with France and her people, the bells at Westminster Abbey will toll at :pm this evening to mark the moment the fire began yesterday. And later this week, on Maundy Thursday, bells will ring at cathedrals and churches across England.  Mrs May said experts from Historic England are coordinating with colleagues across the UK heritage sector to make an offer of support to their French counterparts once the damage has been assessed. She added: President Macron has pledged to rebuild the cathedral and I have conveyed to him the UK will support this endeavour however we can. As we saw last night in the swt and heroic action of the first responders, France has huge professionalism in dealing with emergencies of this kind. I pay tribute to the firefighters and all those involved. When it comes to the task of rebuilding, French craftsmen and women are among the finest in the world. As they prepare to embark on this daunting task, we stand ready to offer any UK experience and expertise that could be helpful in the work that lies ahead to restore this magnicent cathedral.Meanwhile, shocking interior photos have revealed the scale of the devastation - showing blackened walls, holes in the roof and piles of charred rubble - as fashion billionaires line up to pay for rebuilding efforts that will go on for many years.   More than  firefighters battled through the night to save the main structure, iconic towers, main works of art and organ, finally extinguishing the inferno about  hours after it was first noticed. Investigators are treating the cause of the devastating blaze as an accident, possibly as a result of restoration work. They will be interviewing workers from five companies that had been hired to work on renovations to the cathedralaposs roof, which was where the flames started, amid a £million project. Remarkably, only three people - two police officers and one firefighter - were injured as the fire engulfed the massive structure, and they were only slightly hurt. After the blaze broke out on Monday evening, flames ate through the roof and sent the spire crashing to the ground as teams raced to recover treasures from the -year-old Gothic masterpiece, which housed priceless artacts and signicant religious relics that will now go into storage or be transferred to the Louvre Museum.

The shop’s license was repeatedly called in for review between  and .

Councillors ordered the store to retrain their staff and install CCTV cameras. Mr Singh was prominently featured in the Tories’ nationwide party election broadcast ahead of May’s local elections. He was shown canvassing alongside the Prime Minister and other local candidates.    Mr Singh said: What happened was there was a big nationwide issue where this fake Jacobs Creek wine had managed to get into the supply chain and in lots of shops. We found out there had been  stores caught with this fake Jacobs Creek in the idea by Trading Standards. The supplier that we bought it from was fully bona fide, it was a very, very well established supplier. We bought it assuming it was genuine and to me it looked genuine. He added: Looking back on it in hindsight, there were spelling errors on the actual bottle. That was a mistake that we made, and we totally regretted it.  Mr Singh said the claim he or his staff had served under age drinkers had come from an anonymous complaint to the police, but that at the time he couldnapost prove it wasnapost true. He said: There was no evidence to prove that anybody had been served under age, all it was was an anonymous report. But he accepted the licensing  had sided with the police and conditions were added to his license. Mr Singh no longer runs the shop, having sold it several years ago. He now describes himself as a “a bit of an entrepreneur”, who is currently involved in property redevelopment, but has “been involved in setting up lots of businesses over the years.” “I’m working hard on my campaign at the moment,” he told the Mirror. “Looking forward to becoming,I get elected, a local ward councillor and represent the people of St Mary’s ward.” He said canvassing with the Prime Minister was “really exciting”, adding that   Mrs May comes out canvassing every couple of weeks and was “a very good local MP.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy saved 965000 arcade tickets","story":"NewsBoy saved , arcade tickets for giant Minion - now he has new plan for themJack Barker, , now has two wheelbarrows full of the tickets after spotting the prize when he was just fourShareCommentsByAmy Coles:,  APR NewsJack Barker with his two wheelbarrows full of tickets \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA boy who spent six years saving , arcade tickets for a giant Minions toy has vowed to donate his stash to charity.

I was so excited. While stuck on the grounded flight, Charlotte and her pals began to get frustrated with airline staff. She said: For the most part, we were told we had to remain seated. One of my bridesmaids desperately needed to use the toilet but wasnapost allowed to go initially. As time went on, I started to become frustrated, five of my friends were already in Paris waiting for us.    By pm the group was still in the UK, Charlotteaposs group had missed their evening plans including a pre-booked karaoke booth for £. To make it to Disneyland Paris the following day, the hen party was to travel to get a Eurostar for pm. She said: We were kept waiting when we could have been making alternative arrangements. When it all became too much, I began to cry. We disembarked the plane to be met with a huge queue in the airport foyer people were scrambling to get to the ticket desk. We had to choose between lining up and seeing what our options were or leaving to try and make the Eurostar to Paris. The group made it to Disneyland Paris by am the next day, but Charlotteaposs closest friend dropped out just before they boarded the Eurostar. Charlotte described the ordeal as heartbreaking. easyJet have refunded the groupaposs Eurostar ticket costs, but have refused to pay out any compensation. Charlotte has instructed Bott and Co. to pursue easyJet for compensation. A spokesperson for easyJet said: “Like other airlines flying to and from London Southend on  February, easyJet had to ert Ms West’s previous flight from Paris to Stansted because of fog over Southend. Because the weather didn’t improve unfortunately the flight had to be cancelled. Whilst these circumstances were outside of our control we’d like to apologise for the inconvenience caused. “All passengers on the flight were given the option of transferring their flight free of charge or obtaining a refund and we provided hotel accommodation and meals for those requiring it. As the flight was cancelled because of adverse weather outside of our control no compensation under EU is due. However we have refunded Ms West for her flight, her alternative Eurostar transport and all reasonable expenses. “The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is always easyJetaposs highest priority.

Abdul Haadi Mubarak, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, was found by his mother face-down and blue after falling asleep on the sofa. She immediately called an ambulance and paramedics instructed her to perform CPR on her son, which her sister, who had first-aid training, stepped in to do. But tragically, despite the efforts of the paramedics who rushed him to the Royal Oldham Hospital, they could not find a heartbeat and he was pronounced dead later that evening.An inquest into his death at Rochdale Coroneraposs Court today concluded the cause of his death in October could not be explained, reports Manchester Evening News.Speaking after the hearing his mother, Tehreem Nasir, said this decision was aposnot good enoughapos and said she would try to appeal it.    The court heard that from the age of seven months Abdul Haadi had a history of febrile convulsions - which are fits which can happen when a child has a high fever. Before his death, Ms Nasir said Abdul had suffered about  convulsions and had been taken to see his GP and a child specialist for fear he might have epilepsy. But the doctors concluded the febrile convulsions were not harmful and that he would grow out of them by the age of six. On th October , Abdul had been feeling unwell and had a temperature so his mother kept him off school for fear he may have another convulsion. After refusing to eat all day, he fell asleep on the sofa and was looked after by his grandmother when his mother went out to run errands. However, when she ed home at :pm she found him face-down on the sofa and was horried to see his face was blue when she picked him up. He was taken to hospital but could not be saved. Coroner Catherine McKenna gave an open conclusion and said it was not possible to find a cause of death for the child, who had always been happy and adored by his loving family and was one of  grandchildren. She expressed her sympathy and understanding that the conclusion could not bring any closure to Ms Nasir, and Abdul Haadiaposs father, Mubarak Han, who also attended the inquest.    Ms McKenna said: It is clear to me he was a very dearly loved child. The grief that is caused with the loss of a child is unimaginable and it must be all the more so when you havenapost got a clear answer of how he came to his death. Speaking after the inquest, Ms Nasir said: It is not a good enough answer. I was very concerned about his febrile convulsions, there is not enough research. My son should have been investigated further because I do not knowthat was a reason that caused his death. At the end of the day, my son is gone, he has passed away. There is nothing I can do about it. I am a Muslim, I believe le are death are in Godaposs hands. My son is in heaven, he is away from this nasty world, and I will be reunited with him again. Paediatric Pathologist Dr Melanie Newbould, who conducted Abdulaposs autopsy, said the medical cause of death was unacertained. The court heard that she had considered a cardiac arrhythmia or a death related to epilepsy, but said there was no evidence to suggest either way what had happened.    She said: Itaposs possible that several factors played their part. This is a common verdict, however, in the case of sudden death in young children. During the inquest, Ms Nasir voiced concerns that Abdul had received an MMR jab days before his death and questioned whether the two were linked. But Dr Arindam Mukherjee, a pediatrician, said this could not be the case. He said: I am particularly confident that they wouldnapost have done it [administered the MMR]they had the slightest suspicious that it is causing any damage to children. If as a doctor I had any suspicion I wouldnapost have done it with my own kids. He expressed his sympathy that the family may never be able to get an answer about exactly what caused Abdulaposs death. I do not know the answer and I do not knowanyone will be able to give you the answer, he said. We have tried our best to get you the answer but it is dficult when a child has suddenly died to pinpoint a cause of death. After concerns about the MMR jab were raised again by the family, Ms McKenna said in her conclusion to the court: There is no evidence to suggest a clear link between the MMR vaccine and his death. I just do not have the evidence and I am now allowed to speculate.

It comes as a £billion damages claim brought against the corporation on behalf of millions of UK consumers was revived by a landmark ruling by the Court of Appeal. Former financial ombudsman Walter Merricks is trying to bring legal action against the card giant on behalf of an estimated . million people. He alleges that Mastercardaposs breaches of competition law, found by the European Commission in , have led to UK consumers paying higher prices on purchases from businesses that accepted Mastercard. Mr Merricksapos proposed class action was thrown out in July  by a specialist tribunal, which ruled the claim was not suitable to be brought in collective proceedings.    But, giving judgment in London on Tuesday, senior judges found that the Competition Appeal Tribunalhad applied the wrong legal test in deciding whether to give the claim the go-ahead. Lord Justice Patten, sitting with Lord Justice Hamblen and Lord Justice Coulson, said the CAT demanded too much information about how the fees Mastercard charged on transactions were said to have been passed on to consumers. The judge also ruled the tribunal misdirected itself in relation to how any damages which might ultimately be awarded were to be ided among the claimants. Mr Merricksapos proposed claim will go back to the CAT, which will have to reconsider whether to allow it to proceed. In a statement after the ruling, Mr Merricks said: I am very pleased with todayaposs decision. It is nearly  years since Mastercard was clearly told that they had broken the law by imposing excessive card transaction charges, damaging consumers over a prolonged period. As a result we all had to pay higher prices in the shops than we should have done - while Mastercard have pocketed the profits. Itaposs now time for Mastercard to admit the damage they did, to apologise to the British public, and to agree to pay the compensation they owe.    Mr Merricksapos solicitor Boris Bronfentrinker, from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan, said: Today is truly a landmark day for all UK consumers that Mr Merricks seeks to represent in a claim to recover the billions in damages caused to them by Mastercardaposs unlawful anti-competitive conduct. A Mastercard spokeswoman said the company was seeking permission to appeal against the ruling to the Supreme Court. She said in a statement: This decision is not a final ruling and the proposed claim is not approved to move forward, rather the court has simply said a rehearing on certain issues should happen. Mastercard continues to disagree fundamentally with the basis of the claim and we believe UK consumers receive real value from the security, convenience and consumer protection of our payment services. The proposed claim follows the European Commissionaposs  decision that Mastercard had breached competition law in relation to the setting of certain fees charged between banks over Mastercard transactions. Mr Merricksapos claim, which seeks an aggregate award of damages and interest totalling some £. billion, is one of the first mass consumer claims brought in the UK after the introduction of a class action regime in . The proposed action is an opt-out claim, which means potential claimants - anyone who was over the age of  and resident in the UK for at least three months between  and , and who made a purchase from a business that accepted Mastercard - are part of the action unless they specically choose not to be.

Joan Ward, , is the nation’s oldest greengrocer, Gordon Bird, , is a newsagent, Gilbert Bird, , has a carpet shop, Patricia Luhrs, , runs a cafe, Alwyn Bird, , is a hotelier and the baby of the family, Melvyn Bird, , is a motorbike riding instructor. One still chases thieves from his shop, another is planning a motorbike trip across Russia and the eldest won’t let broken bones stop her grafting. But ask any of these Barnsley-born siblings when they plan to retire and they burst into fits of laughter and tell you to “stop swearing”.  Alwyn says: “Retiring is not a word to us. We can’t stop working until our older sister does.” All the clan, who between them have  children,  grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, still drive, own their own homes and have never claimed benefits. They put their work ethic down to a “tough childhood”. Some started work aged three and six on their dad’s horse-drawn greengrocery cart. They were so poor they couldn’t afford toothbrushes or underwear and used old fag packets to block up the holes in their shoes. It has been a hard le, but their positive mental attitude drives them on, even now.  The chatty gang couldn’t stop laughing as they spoke to us about their “infectious” addiction to work. Joan, a mum of three, runs her stall single-handedly and has worked six days a week for  years. She still drives her Ford van collecting her produce and refuses to take time off. A few weeks ago she fell but was soon back at work despite having  stitches in a bad head wound. She says: “People like coming in here because they get a smile and I like chatting to people. What’s  – I feel .”  Her daughter, Kate, , runs a card shop at the same market in Wath upon Dearne, South Yorks, where her mum works. Kate says: “Nobody can retire until my mum retires because she’d frown on us. “I once watched her packing apples with a broken arm. I really had to persuade her to let me take her to the hospital.” Gordon was a miner for almost  years, working at the coal face, before starting his newsagent business. He starts work at Mellors News in Cudworth, South Yorks, at .am, seven days a week. Gordon says: “I’ve sold the Daily Mirror for  years and I’ve never been late with the papers and never not delivered. I’ve two members of staff who are the best in the world. I trust them with my le.”  Talking about his upbringing, he says: “My father was brought out of the pit, near dead after an accident. He had a head injury and couldn’t work. You couldn’t get social security then so he took up a horse and cart and started as a greengrocer. “Our childhood was very tough, basically we had very little to eat because it was wartime. “I was six when I started going on the horse and cart with him to Barnsley Market for produce. The only thing we knew was work.”  Gordon admits he is the joker of the family, but crooks targeting his business don’t find him that funny. Just a few weeks ago he chased a youth for  yards after he tried to pass him a forged £ note. He says: “I told him I was going to confiscate it and he snatched it out of my hand and ran out of the shop with a girl. I chased them through the car park, shouting, ‘He’s a bloody thief’. There was video of them so the police got their car number.” On another occasion thieves fleeing his shop were pelted with objects, including a vase, from the flat above. Gordon says: “My we was worried she was going to be next out the window.” Dad-of-one Gilbert has run G  E Carpet Shop in Glossop, Derbys, for  years after starting out as a slaughterman and then sheepskin salesman. He says: “I work six days a week,I’m lucky. Sometimes I only work fivemy grandson helps out on a Saturday.” Asked what he loves about his job, he says: “The lting. It keeps you fit picking up carpet and underlay.”  Big sister Joan still keeps him on his toes. He says: “If I’m out doing a measure and she rings up and speaks to my we, she says, ‘Why’s he not working ’” Gilbert also started work young. He says: “I was only three when I went on the horse and cart. My job was to keep the tomatoes warm to stop them cracking with the frost.” His sister Pat carries on serving in the cafe as we all chat. She worked with children with learning dficulties and was kept on until she was . Gilbert had persuaded her to retire, but weeks later she was back at work.  She says: “It was like waiting for God. I watched as someone weeded their tiny garden and decided it wasn’t for me. After I finished my garden, I thought, ‘What now ’ Then Joan told me someone had walked out of the cafe and I said, ‘I’ll take it’.” She now works six days a week from am to pm before starting on her second job, making wedding cakes. She too started work young. By the time she was , her parents had got themselves a fish and chip shop, and Pat was put to work frying spuds. Dad-of-four, Alwyn, who was in the Navy and served in the Falklands, now runs the Oakleigh Hotel in Blackpool, Lancs, with his we Muriel, . They work seven days a week, starting with breakfasts, then cleaning and then running the bar, an -hour day at times.  Alwyn, who started work aged eight, peeling spuds in the chippie like Pat, says: “When we see these kids and the teachers closing schools down because of snow, we wonder why. Because our dad would say, ‘Here’s a shovel’ and we used to have to dig our way to school.” Melvyn, who spent  years in the Army, owns the Birds Bike Academy in Barnsley, South Yorks, working  to  hours a day, seven days a week. He will have time off soon, though, as he is planning a ,-mile ride from Russia to the Pacic Ocean. He arrives at the cafe carrying his helmet, chuffed after booking a client on his way in.  His brothers tease him, saying he had it easy as he was “the baby”. But Melvyn was just three when their mum Kitty died of a stroke. He says: “Everybody is here to support you in this family. They won’t carry you, they’ll give you a kick up the arse and say, ‘Get your act together’. “But we’re all millionaires because we’re all happy.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle one most confident","story":"NewsMeghan Markle is one of the most confident Royals ever - but tiny gesture gives her awayMeghan Markle seemed to adapt to le in the Royal Family pretty smoothly, and she always seems to be enjoying her new role at Prince Harrys sideShareCommentsByZoe ForseyAudience Writer:,  APR NewsMeghan seems to be loving her new role \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Meghan Markle is unlike the Royals weaposve had in recent years.Her celebrity background meant she was well used to the spotlight before she stood next to her Prince and showed off that stunning engagement ring.

Temperatures could be C warmer than usual for this time of year, with the Met Office predicting highs of about C on Good Friday and Saturday, and y periods of sunshine. Some weather models suggest the trend of above average warmth will continue through the end of the month and into May, making the UK warmer than some of Europeaposs top holiday destinations. A apospollen bombapos could cause le-threatening attacks for asthma sufferers, and bring further misery to those with hay fever as pollen counts soar to dangerously high levels this week.    The Met Office said Tuesday will be mostly cloudy with the best sunshine in the east. Rain in Northern Ireland, southwest England and western Scotland will move eastwards and become patchier. The north will be breezy and chilly under cloud, while the south will see temperatures as warm as C. UV levels will be moderate in most places, while the pollen level will be high in the southeast. In the evening, the rain will ease over western southern and central areas and it will remain cloudy, with low cloud, mist and fog patches, the Met Office said.  Most places will be dry with plenty of sunshine on Wednesday as temperatures climb into the high teens. Eastern England could see some afternoon showers. Thursday will be largely dry with more sunshine and warmth, and very warm conditions are expected in southern and western areas on Friday. The UK could be hotter than St Tropez in the south of France, the Greek island of Corfu, Bodrum in southern Turkey, Spanish tourism hotspot Marbella, and the island of Majorca, which is to be cloudy on Saturday and Sunday.  London and sheltered areas in the sun across the south east could see temperatures of up to -C, the hottest in the country, and even warmer than the expected high of C in Marbella over the weekend. Temperatures could peak at C in places with prolonged sunshine. Cardf may hit C on Saturday, the same across areas in Northern Ireland, as Glasgow and Aberdeen will be around C, despite the UK average of .C for this time of year.

Clouds could usher in some cooler temperatures in the north and some parts of the east coast on Easter Sunday, the cooler of the two days.  Mr Partridge said: After there was a chilly spell this weekend, we are going to see temperatures gradually increase through the week. By the weekend we could see in parts of the country temperatures of around C, or just above. The highest temperature ever recorded for an Easter weekend is .Cwhich occurred in two dferent years. The first was in Heathrow, west London and Mildenhall, Suffolk in  and the second was recorded Wisley, Surrey in .

Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden said warmer-than-usual temperatures could continue into the start of summer. He told the Express: “Later in April we are likely to see some further potentially substantial warm spells and these will continue at times through May. “This will pave the way for what could be a warm start to summer, although this comes with some caveats sue to deviations in the jet stream.” Met Office five-day weather forecast Tuesday It will be mostly cloudy, with some brightness in the east.

Her official job title is confectionery product developer and she helps the supermarket select and create a iety of chocolate for their many customers.Andyou werenapost already feeling jealous about Hollyaposs job, then you might just start going green with envy when you hear that in the run up to Easter, sheaposs paid to sample around  chocolate eggs for the store.    While eating chocolate all day may sound like fun and games, thereaposs also a lot of work that goes into the role.For example, Holly revealed that the Easter egg taste tests took an estimated  hours to complete this year.And landing the eggciting role in the first place wasnapost as easy as pie. Despite being a foodie from a young age, Holly had to study hard to break into the industry, earning herself a Masters degree in Advanced Food Marketing.    She first started working in product development across meat and ready-meals, before finally moving onto confectionery. But the jump from savoury to sweet meant that there was more training to be done. Holly had to improve her taste buds before starting in the role, attending chocolate courses, which helped her understand everything from the manufacturing process to the perfect pairings for chocolate.    Speaking about her job and what sheaposs learned so far, Holly said: The best way to learn about chocolate quality and flavour profiles is through the experience of trying chocolate from all areas of the world. She went on to reveal her favourite type of chocolate - and it changes depending on her mood. If I’m looking for an after dinner nibble then I like a couple of squares of dark chocolate to curb the craving, she explained. If I have a real sweet tooth and I’m looking to indulge with a bar of chocolate, then it has to be Swiss white chocolate! But when it comes to her favourite part of the job, surprisingly, it’s not all about eating the chocolate itself.  For me, the best part of the job has to be the submission process, she added. After working on a brief and writing all your ideas down on paper, it is so satisfying seeing the products in person and then trying them. There’s nothing quite like seeing customers pick up the final product off the shelf either! So how exactly does Holly pick the perfect Easter eggs for Sainsburyaposs  Holly says the ideal egg should tap into foodie trends, be quirky and offer something dferent to shoppers. Within our range of eggs this year, we have tried to include some of the trends we saw in the market like geometric shapes alongside gold, bronze and silver lustres.We’ve also seen a growing trend for customers searching for larger, more extravagant shaped eggs that they can enjoy together, or give as gts at Easter. The new exclusive brand, Cocoa et Co. XL Belgian Milk Chocolate Splatter Egg works as the perfect sharing centrepiece or present.She added: The Easter season keeps getting bigger and bigger and each year we are seeing more innovation on the market – which makes it even more exciting for a product developer. Sainsbury’s range of Easter eggs can be found  online  and in store across locations nationwide.

So far it has raised nearly £k towards the goal to create an educational shrine to vaginas, vulvas and the broader gynaecological anatomy. The founders believe itaposs time for a museum dedicated to vaginas after learning in  about the existence of one dedicated to penises.    Disco parties, comedy nights, school tours and art exhibitions may be unusual ways to help break the stigma associated with female genitals. But the founders hope that offering a fascinating museum featuring everything science and history to vulva cupcakes and aposvagacchinoapos coffees will make visitors feel more comfortable with the important topic. The museum is the brainchild of Florence Schechter. After learning about Icelandaposs Phallological Museum, which displays hundreds of penises from animals, Ms Schechter felt it was only fairthere was a physical building that spotlighted female genitals as well. So, she decided to make that happen. Through workshops, talks and social events, she said she wanted to create a space that would bring people together - young and old - to address sensitive issues like female genital mutilation, rape, domestic abuse, and sexual health.  Itaposs really important because itaposs a hugely stigmatised part of the body and that leads to some real world consequences, said the museumaposs director Schechter, who is currently raising funds for the building. Just anything and everything thataposs taboo with that part of the body is what weaposre going to be addressing. She said some girls and women feel awkward about getting gynaecological check-ups, such as screenings for cervical cancer, or discussing their periods. About one in four women in Britain do not attend a cervical screening, according a January survey by charity Joaposs Cervical Cancer Trust, with nearly three-quarters of women saying they missed the test due to embarrassment. Menstruation is still taboo in many countries. In Nepal, women are banished from their homes during their periods - a centuries-old practice that is now illegal - and several have died of smoke inhalation after lighting fires to keep warm.    Schechter said it was important for the museum to cater to children, and plans to run child-friendly programmes for families and schools so they can feel comfortable talking about female genitals at an early age. The museum planned for Camden Market is meant to be an interim facility, as the founders work towards a dream of building a permanent museum based somewhere in the UK. The fundraising website says: The ultimate plan is to build a permanent Vagina Museum that takes a holistic view of vaginas, from science to history to their place in culture. It will be a erse place where there will be lots of dferent ways of engaging and getting involved. ​The museum is dedicated to being gender inclusive and intersectional.

A huge investigation has been launched after hundreds have been left with skin problems and other health issues in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires. A judge has suspended the use of pesticides in three areas of the capital after tests confirmed that the water supply is contaminated and potentially causing a health crisis. However, the Buenos Aires water authority has reportedly rejected those results and new tests have been ordered by the Supreme Court’s toxicology team.    The legal action was taken after numerous residents in the area of Villa Alicia in the city of Pergamino located in the eastern Argentine province of Buenos Aires reported suffering severe health problems. The judge said: “Provision will be made for the immediate suspension of products with pesticides, herbicides, insecticides and any other kind of agrochemical, whether by means of agricultural fumigations containing glyphosate as an active ingredient or the salts derived from it.” Experts from the National Scientic and Technical Research Council, as well as other institutes and universities, then carried out further tests which again found high levels of agrochemicals in the area’s water supply, according to local media.    Those results were also rejected. New analysis is currently underway although the results are not ready yet. According to local media, Pergamino resident Sabrina Ortiz suffered a miscarriage in , the same day a nearby soy field was fumigated. She had already been suffering with skin conditions, just like her husband and -year-old daughter. Mrs Ortiz reported the incident and formed the association ‘Mothers In Fumigated Areas of Pergamino’ with other residents.    The group carried out protests in the city and demanded that the authorities address the situation as a health crisis. Fteen days later, Judge Carlos Villafuerte Ruzo suspended the use of the listed agrochemicals. The group also believes that pesticides are responsible for  cancer cases in the area, according to reports.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bob shields south ayrshrie council","story":"NewsBob Shields: South Ayrshrie Council need new plan to build hundreds of homesRiiverside flats face being pulled downShareByAyrshire Post:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’ve dominated Ayr’s skyline for exactly half a century. They’re aesthetically unappealing, architecturally worthless and my three year old grandson could probably knock up an exact replica in Lego while his left hand was peeling the foil off his Easter egg. Carbuncles, eyesores, blots on the landscape - you can call them what you like. But for a couple of hundred people at least . . . it’s the place that they call ‘home’. Last week, South Ayrshire Council started the first phase of what could end in the demolition of Ayr’s trident of riverside flats. Officials began door knocking at Riverside Place as part of the promised consultation with the remaining residents to help decide whether the flats should be renovated . . . or simply razed to the ground. By all accounts – including my dear old  year old dad – the housing staff were considerate and sympathetic while listening to everyone’s point of view. And while the many senior citizens at Riverside didn’t exactly link their arms defiantly and chant “We shall not be moved” – they left the consultants with a similar but equally strong message - “We don’t want to be moved . . .” This leaves South Ayrshire Council between three, fourteen storey blocks – and a hard place. The flats all need “core” work to their internal cladding which has reached “the end of its design le”. To simply ignore the advice of the independent structural engineers isn’t an option. In this post-Grenfell era, the words “cladding” and “tower block” make even the pencils on a health and safety officer’s desk stand to attention. But with an estimated price tag of £ million for the renovations, South Ayrshire Council must balance whether saving Riverside Place is best value compared to simply knocking them down and starting a new-build site. They next conundrum for SAC is then the poser – is best value always best practice  Re-housing – and I mean satisfactorily re-housing – what is likely to be at least  people is a decant operation of Normandy proportions. Personally, I don’t think old Bob Snr is physically or mentally equipped to be transferred anywhere. And there must be dozens - or even scores - just like him at Riverside Place. A good place for SAC to start would be to put hundreds of minds at rest and pledge ‘no compulsory transfers’ out of Riverside Place. And after that . . . work out how the heck they can achieve it! Getting the number of tenants down to  – enough to fill two blocks – would be my starting point. Decanting from one block to a similar flat in another is the least intrusive option. I don’t like the phrase ‘natural wastage’ – but it can’t be ignored. Like anywhere  in the world, Riverside Place will have its share of residents who pass on to a much higher level than fourteen floors. I’ve also spoken to several residents who would seriously consider a temporary move to other parts of Ayr – in exchange for a ‘rent free’ package. Yep – it’s called bribery . . . but it could work. And it would mean work do be done to one block at a time – with residents moving between the two that are habitable. However,the final decision is to demolish Riverside Place, it’s a whole new ball game. Butthis really is the ‘pivotal point for Ayr town centre’ that everyone is talking about – it’s the ideal time for SAC to come up with a new local authority housing plan to build hundreds of new homes over the next few years. And finally, let’s not forget the third option. Empty the flats . . . surround them in scaffolding . . . cover them in white plastic . . . and forget about them!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"residents ayrshire want more bobbies","story":"NewsResidents in Ayrshire want more bobbies on the beatCall for extra funding for frontline officersShareByStephen Houston:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe majority of residents say there are not enough police officers on the beat, according to a new report .

The figure emerged the same week the Scottish Police Federation staged its annual conference at Turnberry Hotel. Tory John Scott MSP has called on the SNP to deflect funding into putting more police in Ayrshire. He: “We should all recognise the professional job done by police officers in what are undoubtedly extremely challenging circumstances, but the reality is that job is made much harder by the lack of adequate resources . At the Scottish Police Federation’s annual conference held at Turnberry, the concern was that there was just not enough officers on the frontline. It’s clear the Scottish Government needs to give our police a greater share of resources, so they can do the job of keeping us all safe.” The survey asked Ayrshire peopletheir local bobbies patrol on foot - and only . per cent said yes. This figure has more than halved in the last five years. Nearly  per cent said they had seen police bicycle patrols in their area, and . per cent by car. Some  per cent believed the police did not patrol their area regularly.

Operations Control mobilised three fire engines to the forest at Loch Doon where firefighters continued to monitor overnight and to manage any potential spread. The public have been advised to stay away from the area and nearby residents should keep their windows closed. Crews are working alongside the Forestry Commission and Police Scotland and will remain on scene until the area is made safe. A rest and welfare facility has been established in the community centre in Dalmellington for any local residents affected by the fire. Assistant Chief Officer for Response and Resilience Lewis Ramsay said: “Our crews across Scotland have had a challenging weekend attending numerous incidents. “Due to the outstanding collaborative working with land owners, The Forestry Commission and Police Scotland we have been able to ensure the safety of our communities. “I would like to thank the wider community for their ongoing support, the hard work of our partners, and the crews on the ground for their tireless efforts.” Firefighters are also still in attendance at a wildfire at Paul’s Hill wind farm near Aberlour. A number of fire engines were mobilised to the area after the call came in at .pm on Saturday, April . A wildfire warning was issued in conjunction with the Scottish Wildfire Forum for this weekend. Wild and grass fires can start by the careless disposal of cigarettes and barbecues or campfires left unattended.They then have the potential to burn for days and devastate vast areas of land, wildle and threaten the welfare of nearby communities - swallowing up emergency service resources. SFRS Area Manager Bruce Farquharson is the chair of the Scottish Wildfire Forum. He said: We saw last year the devastating effect wildfires can have on communities and wildle. The dry and warm weather we are currently experiencing means there is a heightened risk of wildfire across the country. Many rural and remote communities are hugely impacted by wildfires, which can cause signicant environmental and economic damage. Livestock, farmland, wildle, protected woodland and sites of special scientic interest can all be devastated by these fires - as can the lives of people living and working in rural communities. The SFRS works closely with land managers, communities and other safety partners to prevent these incidents ever occurring. Area Manager Farquharson continued: At the start of spring there is often a lot of dead vegetation leftover from last year - this fuel can dry out quickly with higher temperatures and lower humidity levels. A great many people will be enjoying the outdoors in the good weather this weekend, we urge everyone to make sure that they don’t increase the chance of wildfire – be aware of the risks and follow the Scottish Outdoor Access Code. Wildfires are a major threat to our wildle and wild places. We encourage people visiting the outdoors to be extra careful, and check the advice in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code before starting a fire. The public can help prevent wildfires by making sure they dispose of litter and smoking materials carefully while in rural areas.

developing Lowood Estate, ahead of a decision to splash out more than pound million was approved.The report, produced by the property consultancy firm Jones Lang LaSalle , determined that the Lowood portion of the Tweedbank masterplan is ldquounviable and undeliverable and that ldquoit is quite clear that what is proposed is over-development of the site.The damning report, commissioned by Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound. million in December .Once costs of borrowing and other fees have been factored in, the purchase will cost SBC around pound million and forms parts of its wider plan to address a regional housing shortfall of some  units.The Lowood site has been earmarked for around  properties, however the JLL report suggests that the development is unlikely to yield any financial gain.The report claims: ldquoOur conclusion is that there would be insufficient revenue to generate either a developerrsquos profit or a positive land value.In addition to questioning the economic viability of the development, the JLL report raises concerns that ldquothe level of development and infrastructure proposed would seriously harm the environment and the River Tweed interests from a physical and amenity perspective.Stuart Bell, SBC Councillor for Tweeddale East, told the Borderthat he nor other voting councillors were not given access to the report prior to rubber-stamping the planned purchase of the land.He said: ldquoI was unaware of this report and its conclusions when the decision was taken by Scottish Borders Council to purchase the Lowood Estate.ldquoI think that many other Borders councillors were similarly in ignorance of it which is worrying given the signicance of its conclusions that the Lowood proposal is over-development and not commercially viable.ldquoThis does seem strange to me when the report is dated March  and I understand it was passed to council officers.ldquoGiven the potential signicance of the analysis and conclusions I have written to SBC officers asking for clarication on why this report was not brought immediately to the attention of councillors.Scottish Borders Council has defended both the report not being tabled and also the purchase of the picturesque estate.A spokesperson said: ldquoThe JLL report was produced as a response to the Housing Supplementary Guidance document which the council was required to produce as part of the Local Development Plan.ldquoHowever, it was not submitted to the council until after the expiry of the public consultation period and after the Guidance had been considered and approved by the council in August .,params: .pushldquoThere was therefore no opportunity for it to be presented to Councillors when they agreed to allocate Lowood for development.ldquoThe viability of development at Lowood Estate was thoroughly reviewed in a series of subsequent technical reports that formed the basis of the recommendations made to councillors in private on May , .ldquoThe report considered by Members in March  contained detailed analysis including a thorough consideration of market conditions which went signicantly beyond the scope of the JLL report.ldquoWe remain satisfied that the basis of the recommendations to and decisions made by councillors on May  is robust and includes a comprehensive review of all relevant issues contained in the JLL report.ldquoWe believe this vital site is capable

We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid. Smallpox was declared to be globally eradicated in . Children are no longer vaccinated so they are potentially at risk,it comes back.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"20km-diversion-may-drive-you-crazy","story":"A km stretch of the B at Mayshiel, south east of Gford,will be shut for three days from Monday to allowcarriageway resurfacing to take place.The ersion route takes drivers on a km tour through East Lothian villages, includingGarvald and Gford, beforerejoining the road west of Mayshiel.The B passing the entrance to Mayshiel Farm.

latest high-tech VR headsets, one inidual was transported to Jerusalem, a place he had always dreamed of visiting.In another session, a -year-old woman was thrilled to revisit her childhood home in

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

thumping Commons majority when in fact she is a minority leader of an unstable coalition. Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge.

The UK Government needs to bring the devolved administrations back on board as lsquofully engagedrsquo partners in the Brexit process, and do so as soon as possible.In a brutal assessment of Mrs Mayrsquos handling of the process so far, the IFG catalogued a series of errors made at the start of her premiership.Early negotiations were ldquobedevilled by cabinet disagreements over whether to go for a soft or hard Brexit, with the PM focused too much on preserving party unity.Splitting responsibilities between Downing Street and the Department for Exiting the European Unionwas also ldquomisguided, as it led to tensions between the two.ldquoThis feeling of ision at the top of the negotiating team was compounded by the secretive approach adopted by the Prime Minister and her advisers, it said.The UK Government also failed to engage with parliament, only sharing key information with MPs after being held in contempt, and resisting initial demands for a meaningful vote.It ldquoalienated the devolved governments, culminating in a first for devolution: Holyrood withholding consent for the main Brexit law at Westminster and then being overruled.It said: ldquoThis should not become the norm. Early and regular engagement with the devolved governments and legislatures should help avoid further damage to intra-governmental relations.The government also tried a lsquoide and rulersquo strategy of woo inidual EU leaders to back its position that completely backfired, and led the EU to present a more united front.ldquoThe UKrsquos attempts to ide and conquer were not helped by tone deaf interventions by ministers and senior politicians designed to appeal to domestic audiences, it said.When the UK was successful, such as in talks on the European Atomic Energy Community, it was because the UK decided on its objectives early and engaged with specics.The report warned the UK similarly risks ldquostumbling into talks about future trade and security relations, potentially putting the country at a disadvantage for decades.It said a clear plan and a focus on detail was the key to the next phase, and recommended the Prime Minister appoint a political deputy to ldquoknock departmental heads together.The Cabinet Office, not DExEU, should co-ordinate the negotiations, and the under-used experts at the Department for International Trade should be at the heart of the talks.ldquoThe EU made a virtue of its transparency and willingness to engage during Phase One, whereas the UK was secretive and defensive, and failed to engage properly with Parliament, the devolved administrations, business groups and civil society, it said.If the Government was serious about negotiating a future relationship that worked for the whole UK, it had to engage with the devolved governments and accept outside input.To improve transparency, a designated select committee should hold regular hearings on the negotiations and engage with Holyrood committees.Through the existing Joint Ministerial Committee, the Prime Minister ldquoshould discuss any mandate for the future relationship with the devolved First Ministers, giving them an opportunity to voice their thoughts and concerns ndash but not to veto it.Holyrood and the Welsh Assembly should also get regular updates, but not a vote on the final deal, it said.UK ministers should be willing to give evidence on progress to committees of the devolved legislatures.IFG programme director Jill Rutter said: ldquoHasty decisions created completely foreseeable problems for the exit negotiations, compounded by the inability of the Cabinet to reach an agreed position on the key future economic relationship.ldquoWhoever is Prime Minister for the second phase of the negotiations needs to ensure that they avoid similar mistakes next time round.SNP Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said the report backed up the Scottish Governmentrsquos complaints about Scotland being ldquoignored.He said: ldquoThis report merely confirms what we have consistently said ndash namely, that Scotland has been ignored by the UK Government throughout the Brexit process with scant,any, notice taken of our overwhelming vote to remain in the EU.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos detailed compromise proposals have also been ignored or dismissed at every turn.ldquoThis report makes clear that that approach must now change. With the Brexit deadline now extended until  October, that extra time must be used wisely, allowing for all parties and all devolved governments to be properly consulted and involved. The Prime Minister must drop her red lines, which have led to the Brexit impasse.The UK Government said it had ldquoworked constructively with the devolved administrations throughout the first phase of negotiations in order to deliver a Brexit that works for Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland.A spokesperson said: ldquoThere are already regular discussions between the UK and the Devolved Administrations at all levels and the Prime Minister has set out that there will be an enhanced role for them in the next phase."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9720917.jpg?type=article-full","title":"spanish-unionist-again-raises-prospect-of-scots-veto","story":"Conservative Esteban Gonzaacutelez Pons on Monday said his centre-right Partido Popularwould block any application from an independent Scotlandthe UK was still negotiating its own exit from the bloc.And - countering widely held views where in Europe - he said that evenScotland waited till after Brexit, it would have to wait in a queue behind Turkey and Serbia.His remarks, made ahead of a general election later this month, mark the latest twist in the PPrsquos vacillating attitude to Scotland the EU.They come after a series of far more welcoming statements by other EU politicians, including Belgian Liberal MEP Guy Verhofstadt.BACKGROUND FROM :Spain boosts Sturgeons second independence referendum bidThey also follow assurances from Spanish politicians, including PP when in office, that they would not veto an independent Scotland joining the EU provided sovereignty had been re-established by constitutional means.

Thanks to the ill-conceived method of calculation, which takes no account of the kind of jobs people are doing, how long they have been doing them for or the hours they are doing them in, the gender pay-gap stats tell us practically nothing about the intricacies of workplace inequalities, making them probably the bluntest tool possible for improving the situation where those equalities do exist.Between  and  the overall median pay gap in the UK shrank slightly, from . per cent to .%, meaning that for every pound a middle-earning man earned a middle-earning woman earned p. The dference ies widely between industry sectors, although overall % of employers have a pay gap that favours men while % said their gap had widened in favour of men between the two years.So far, so bad, right  Well, not necessarily when you consider that some employers saw their pay gaps worsen precisely because they had taken action to try to address them. The Royal Institute of British Architectsis a case in point. As the representative body for a profession that is conspicuously dominated by men, it was always likely that the organisationrsquos senior roles - and so its pay gap - would be too. Yet it is largely because it hired more women at the junior end with the longer-term aim of improving the gender balance across its ranks that RIBA saw its pay gap widen from % to % between  and . It is a nuance the reporting system was not built to recognise.Not that it would necessarily be positive evenit was. The legal sector has long been dominated by women at the junior end, with females signicantly outnumbering males in trainee and junior solicitor positions. Though a major sht in the last couple of years means many Scottish law firms are now co-led by a man and a woman, because firms are still grappling with how best to implement family-friendly working practices - which too often is taken to mean female-friendly working practices - partnership remains very much a male domain. And, guess what  That means law-firm pay gaps almost exclusively favour men too.In and of itself all the pay-gap data does is indicate what we already know: that lower-value, part-time and junior roles tend to be filled by women while higher-value, full-time and senior ones are typically dominated by men. Reporting the gaps wonrsquot change that. And while there are obvious problems with the system of reporting - not least that it lumps everyone in together before crudely comparing means and medians - the big mistake David Cameron made was to position pay-gap reporting as an end in itself without requiring employers to come up with ways of addressing them. Worse still, the policy came with neither incentives to promote good practice nor sanctions to deter bad.Some businesses have taken action off their own bats. Drinks giant Diageo - whose manufacturing-based Scottish arm has a pay gap that favours men and office-based English business one that favours women - has overhauled its benefits package to give male and female employees six monthsrsquo paid leave when they become parents in a move that could prove revolutionary. In recognising that fathers as well as mothers are invested in their childrenrsquos upbringing the company has also paved the way for both male and female staff to think about what kind of working pattern might suit their personal needs.Allowing men to experience the issues associated with ing to work after an extended period of leave could also be the best possible way of effecting change from within: nothing fosters understanding like a bit of lived experience.What is clear after two yearsrsquo worth of statistical reports is that we need to change the conversations we are having about gender pay, why dferences exist and how they can be ameliorated. Itrsquos not good enough to explain it away by saying men hold more senior positions - we need to ask why. Then we need to rethink how dferent roles are valued, how success is measured and how we expect jobs to be done so that those positions that pay the most donrsquot remain a predominantly male preserve and those that offer flexibility donrsquot remain a female one.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Under consumer law, firms may be entitled to ask customers to pay a cancellation fee to cover their losses, but the amount they keep must be in proportion to what they are losing.Cancellation terms that do not follow this approach are likely to be unfair and businesses cannot rely on them to resolve claims or disputes with customers.A survey of , people for the CMA found that % of people believe they should get all or most of their money backthey cancel and the business re-sells their booking.Some % think it is unfairthey have to pay part of the cost of a booking when they cancel and % say that travel and holiday businesses do not always make it as easy to cancel a booking as they should.Of those with experience of cancelling a booking, one in five felt they had been treated unfairly.Examples of unfair terms can include those which allow a business to take a large, upfront deposit and refuse to refund any of the customerrsquos moneythey cancel, regardless of the amount the business is losing or the reason for the customer cancelling.Paul Latham, the CMArsquos director of strategy and communications, said: ldquoNobody wants to cancel a trip or holiday, butyou have to, itrsquos important that you are treated fairly and donrsquot lose out more than is absolutely necessary.ldquoFair terms are a legal requirement as well as helping reassure customers that theyrsquore dealing with a company they can trust. Unfair terms canrsquot be enforced so they also wonrsquot protect businesseschallenged. The small print really can make a big dference.Association of British Travel Agentschief executive Mark Tanzer said: ldquoThere are circumstances when a cancellation charge may apply, but it must genuinely reflect the costs of cancellations faced by the travel company. We always encourage people to take out travel insurance as soon as they book their holiday, which should protect them from the costs for most cancellations.Which  Travel editor Rory Boland said: ldquoHaving to call off a long-awaited trip away is bad enough, but itrsquos made even worse when holidaymakers are forced to hand over large sums of money unexpectedly because the cancellation policy is unfair, unclear or buried deep within the terms and conditions.ldquoItrsquos time for travel firms to up their game. If they continue to fail to treat their customers fairly, the CMA should not hesitate to take the enforcement action needed to stop people from getting ripped off.copy -.

The winner chose to accept the cash prize.The ASA said the complainant had entered the promotion in the hope of winning the castle.It said: ldquoWe understood that at the end of the competition three cash prizes were awarded at the value of pound,, pound, and pound, instead of the advertised prize, because the minimum number of entries had not been reached, and that the advertiser had offered the winner a share of the property.ldquoHowever, we considered that a share of the property or any cash alternative that was less than the value of the property, were not reasonable equivalents to the prize as advertised.ldquoBecause neither the advertised prize nor a reasonable alternative had been awarded, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was in breach of the code.Mrs DeVere said in a statement: ldquoIt is fair enough to challenge a competition or any unfairness and it should have taken the ASA a heartbeat to look at our site and see that from the beginning everything was spelled out, including that a cash prize to the value of tickets .

There were dozens, possibly hundreds, of television crews – the most I have seen anywhere since the Lockerbie disaster.Thousands of curious onlookers stood along the banks of the River Seine.On Saturday I saw the gilets jaunes assemble in the Place de la Nation, where so many heads were separated from so many bodies. On Sunday I ran past Notre Dame in the marathon and on Monday afternoon I visited it on a walking tour.I was enjoying happy hour in a bar a couple of miles away and the first I heard of the fire was in a message from Scotland.Paris supposedly wept while Notre Dame burned, but around me people continued to sip their wine and sup their beer.I was the only one excitedly photographing the smoke and what I thought was flames lighting up the darkening sky until I realised there was a big orange circle in the middle of my photo.Although road blocks had been set up, police were allowing many people through yesterday, people who were showing their passes to prove they worked on the island.Many people seemed to be turning up for work as usual.There was an air,not of normality, at least of calm, in a city famous for civil unrest.Notre Dame had survived the Revolution, the Terror and the Nazis. It had been repaired and restored.And yesterday Paris was taking the latest events very much in its stride.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brian monteith the brexit party should not be written off in scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The Brexit Party has launched, and all the evidence suggests it shall complete a successful mission to change our political constellation # but will it land with any Scottish MEPs The tendency in Scotland is to write off sympathy for Brexit but, just as I warned in this column five years ago, there is a substantial eurosceptic minority looking for a voice. The last time there were EU elections in  Scotland ed a Ukip MEP with over , votes and . per cent of the vote. On  May, when the European elections that were not meant to take place will be held, the Brexit Party should pick up that seatit offers a rational and inoffensive home for that existing support. Indeed it could do even betterthere is a signicant fall in Conservative or Labour support. In England and Wales the Conservative Party is already on its way to a collapse. Reports from members out on the stump for council elections on  May already make for harrowing reading back at Tory HQ with tales of doors being slammed in canvassers’ faces, donations drying up and members resigning from the party. What had been a trickle of dissent over first, the Prime Minister’s Chequers betrayal and then her surrender by way of the EU’s Withdrawal Agreement, became a torrent of protests when the UK did not leave the EU on  March as promised incessantly by Theresa May.Over a hundredConservative council candidates and Tory association chairmen have written to the press warning of what could become an existential shock to the party’s actual survival. Social media is full of Tweets and posts about supporters never voting Conservative again so long as Theresa May is leader and the party does not honour its commitment to deliver Brexit.The latest UK polling for the European Parliament elections makes shocking reading for Theresa May’s Conservative Party. A YouGov survey shows Labour ahead on  per cent with Conservatives on  per cent and the Brexit Party – even before it had officially launched on  per cent. Ukip is below on  per cent and the Liberal Democrats slipping to  per cent, and the Independent Group formed of Remain defectors from the Labour and Conservativeson  per cent. SNP Plaid Cymru polled  per cent.One opinion survey is, however, only a snapshot further evidence is necessary to identy trends that suggest a credible consistency in support. Unfortunately for the Conservatives a second poll by Opinium provided that the day after with again Labour firstand Conservatives second– with Ukip thirdand the Brexit Party already fourth . The Liberal Democrats came in at  per cent, Greens and SNP both  per cent and Change UK on  per cent.I expect the freshness of the Brexit Party and the pulling power of its charismatic yet Marmite leader Nigel Farage to help it grow, to the cost of Ukip support. Candidates will be important, but the trend is highly likely for the Brexit Party to take over where Ukip has left off.Importantly, note how in both pollsthe support for Ukip and Brexit Party are put together it is larger than that of the Conservatives, totalling  per cent in YouGov and  per cent in Opinium. The Tories are in dire trouble, with still five weeks to go this can only get worse for Theresa May. The Daily , the unofficial organ of Conservative sentiment is railing against May and urging leadership regime change, while two former Chairmen of the backbench  Committee say the rules to depose the leader can easily be altered.Despite all the foregoing, Scotland is dferent. In the UK referendum the majority of Scottish voters chose Remain and the Scottish Conservative Party has reflected this, with its Holyrood leader, Ruth Davidson, and Scottish Secretary in May’s Cabinet, David Mundell, both devout uber Remainers. Initially, three of the  Scottish Tory MPs sided against the Withdrawal Agreement but that reduced by the time of the third vote. Without an elected figurehead to rally around, and conscious of the need to continue the revival of the party in Scotland any display of recalcitrance in the ranks is also scarce.But wait, there was a City of Edinburgh Council by-election in Leith last week that might suggest all is not well with Conservative voters,not party activists. The Tories talked their chances up, using a hard-working candidate and their good performance in the  council elections to justy the bold claim that only they could beat the SNP. In the end their man came an embarrassing fourth with . per cent of the vote– but more importantly suffered a . per cent drop in support. Could the levee be about to break  It’s hard to be certain, for strong local issues over trams and housing development had recently been in play, causing Labour to lose their last Leith councillor and come third to the SNP winner and Green runner up, both of whom increased their vote share. But the Tories were surprised by their reversal.Beyond scooping-up previous Scottish Ukip votes and disillusioned Conservatives there is a not insubstantial group of SNP voters who voted for Leave in the EU referendum. Ashcroft polling estimated some  per cent of the SNP support back in  got behind Brexit, but currently there is no natural party for eurosceptic nationalists to vote when the UK is meant to be leaving the EU. If the Brexit Party can convince enough of that group to put leaving the EU before their sympathy for leaving the UK – in an election that will become a plebiscite about the EU – then it should not just win one MEP, but could just sneak a second. Some private polling I have seen suggest the SNP could lose  per cent of its vote to the Brexit Party.For the Brexit Party the Scottish political landscape may not look as fertile as it does in England and Wales – where the sense of voter outrage over May’s repeated broken promises is tangible – but it is not barren. With some careful cultivation the Brexit Party should be able to consolidate the eurosceptic support behind it and win a seat. If it can provide an appealing Scottish campaign it could go on to surprise its opponents and give Scottish eurosceptics, be they nationalists or unionists, the voicethey have deserved for the last decade.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"indyref2 won t be far behind an snp labour coalition lesley riddoch","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...As the polls start pointing towards a Labour SNP coalition, indyrefwon#t be too far behind, says Lesley RiddochPredictably, Margaret Hodge’s dodgy tape recording of Jeremy Corbyn on anti-semitism ruled the roost this weekend. It dominated BBC Radio ’s World This Weekend, and the front page of the Sunday Times. Meanwhile the Observer ran with warnings that Labour faces a wipe-out unless Corbyn backs a second Brexit referendum. Jings. Anyone would think Labour was surging in the opinion polls or something – and of course, they are.It was left to Labour’s arch-critics at theto publish the awkward truth a poll of polls shows Labour would be the largest party in the event of a General Election tomorrow, whilst the Tories would lose  seats.Actually, that’s nothing new. Last week Labour’s lead was  per cent in a Harbury Strategy poll  per cent in a Kantar poll  per cent in a Survation poll,  per cent for BMG and the week before  per cent in a Deltapoll for the Mail on Sunday. Indeed, there’s been a slow leftward lurch since Fiona Bruce’s infamous Question Time howler when she wellied into Diane Abbott about Labour’s parlous state in the polls. Actually, Labour were level-pegging with the Tories at the time – but who knew  Or rather, who in charge of Establishment narrative-making wanted to know In Sunday’s poll, another important result was tucked away. The SNP is predicted to pick up  seats which –accurate – would bring their tally to . Not quite the system-busting  achieved in  just after the indyref. But enough to give Jeremy Corbyn a working majority. Put another way, without the SNP, Labour could be the largest party without any clear route to government.The Lib Dem vote is also finally on the rise – the latest poll predicts they’ll add another  seats. But put together with their measly  current seats, that wouldn’t quite be enough to edge Labour over the line into power.So, is a Labour SNP coalition or supply and confidence agreement on the cards – andit is, might that allow Nicola Sturgeon to demand a Section  order from Corbyn as the price of her support  Andit does, is that a bit of an independence game-changer Yes it is.Now admittedly, a Labour SNP win is currently just conjecture. These are opinions polls – not results. The pollsters probably sampled too few Scottish voters to be accurate and several other opinion-changing electoral tests are likely before another general election – including English local elections and the probable European poll, both of which could see a sht from the main parties to Ukip or Nigel Farage’s new Brexit party. Especially since the broadcast media appeared to heave an enormous, collective sigh of relief the minute Farage appeared back on the political scene and have rushed to place him centre stage once again. It’s true too that the collapsing Conservative Party will nonetheless try to delay a general election for as long as possible. Butrecent months have proved anything, it is that no scenario can be completely ruled out on the juddering British political scene.I’ve no doubt Labour and the SNP are already talking behind the scenes – hardly surprising or very dficult these days since prominent MPs from both parties have spent weeks working together on hard Brexit-avoiding amendments. So the polls should give independence supporters cause for cheer.Theresa May’s haughty “now is still not the time” is not necessarily the last word on Scottish Independence in .Happily, the demise of Labour in Scotland and the distancing of Scottish and UK Labour since Corbyn’s election, means the UK party has very little to lose by agreeing to a process that could let Scotland go. Before the indyref, received wisdom insisted that Labour couldn’t win at Westminster without a strong contingent from north of the Border. But since Scottish Labour’s virtual annihilation in , Corbyn has realised he must largely count Scotland out. Of course, it’s true that Labour has no recent experience of power-sharingand there’s no doubt the media would portray a pact with the SNP as a colossal admission of weakness.It’s also impossible to ignore Labour’s extraordinary capacity to shoot itself in the foot. Whilst the anti-semitism story is an old one, it’s still being mishandled and is not likely to leave the front pages anytime soon. The Brexit dilemma is a real one – lack of leadership and fence-sitting have become Corbyn defaults on the biggest dilemma facing Britain. Actually, Labour’s position on that other complex national emergency – the climate emergency – is equally floppy. But in a UK first past the post election, English voters have Hobson’s Choice. Scots can vote to leave the whole sorry mess – but English voters can’t. So whatever happens at council or European level, a UK election is likely to focus minds in England on the two big parties. And despite Labour’s evident weaknesses, the prospect of a Brexiteer Tory leader and Prime Minister will make most progressive voters in England conclude that Corbyn is now the lesser of two evils. So, the prospect of a Labour SNP pact is a real one, and may further deter Nicola Sturgeon from backing any unofficial poll when she makes her long-awaited announcement on a second independence referendum on  April. Of course, that needn’t stop her launching a strategy, which could adopt citizens’ assemblies over the summer to formulate a new independence blueprint as Joanna Cherry MP has suggested. It needn’t stop the First Minister naming a preferred date for a second ballot or going through the forlorn formalities of asking Theresa May for a Section  order. But the whf of longer-term change is now in the air.The recent Leith by-election result showed the SNP and Greens picking up votes – which suggests the Euro elections will be a proxy Brexit referendum re-run with only the independence-supporting parties and the squeezed Lib Dems aligning convincingly with the popular Remain option. Obviously, nothing’s certain, but an even stronger Remain vote north of the Border will act as further evidence of material change and of the irretrievably dferent political cultures that now exist on either sidethe Border. A second independence vote may seem to have taken a back seat to Brexit. But things may be about to change.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why it s childish for men to be irritated by women s football kevan christie","story":"The middle-aged men who seem to be upset by the existence of women#s football should stop getting their knickers in a twist, writes Kevan Christie as Scotland#s international team prepares for the World Cup in France.She was only a fishmonger’s daughter but she knew her plaice – so the old joke goes.However, more and more middle-aged male commentators are now encroaching into areas where their opinions are neither valued nor wanted.The latest ‘hero’ to rush into the penalty box like Roy Keane on steroids looking for an injury time winner was sociology lecturer Stuart Waiton who last week had a right pop atwummin’s fitba’.The gist of Dr Waiton’s argument, in an article in the Herald, was you’re not allowed to slag off the women’s game and it’s in the best interests of anyone with a penis to pretend to like it, lest you be burnt at the stake.He said there was a “conscious attempt” by the BBC to shoehorn stories about women into sports headlines to the detriment of major men’s sporting events watched by millions on television worldwide. Because men’s sport doesn’t get enough coverage, right He then had his Einstein moment and pointed out that women themselves are far more interested in the men’s game – because it is “so much better”.Like-for-like comparisons between men’s and women’s sports are tedioius, pointless and belong in the playground. Comparisons should be avoided and instead both fields should look to compliment and learn from one another.This type of negativity achieves nothing but gives instant gratication to the person spouting boring old tropes like “women tennis players shoudn’t be paid as much as the men”.Sir Andy Murray has rightly hit out on this very issue in his support for equal rights in tennis.No doubt Dr Waiton is now expecting a Purple Heart for bravely speaking out against this “affirmative action” taking place in women’s sport and even managed to throw the Paralympics into the mix as another example of things we have to “feign interest” about.Okay, that covers sportswomen and disabled folk ... high fives all round.: Comment: ‘World Cup can change face of female football in Scotland’The crux of his argument is that there are certain issues where you’re not allowed to say something ‘most people think’, a catch-all phrase used a lot these days – mainly by gammon-faced Brexiteers on the verge of having a stroke because the UK is not leaving the EU without a deal.However, all of this got me thinking about the sheer number of middle-aged men who feel it is our duty to furnish the women of the world with enlightened opinions on their interests and issues. Like they haven’t already had a letime of that.Having never been a woman I know my limitations in this area. This reflects in my day job as Scotsman health reporter where there are certain subjects I feel more knowledgeable about than others – alcoholism and obesity over period poverty and transvaginal mesh implants, for instance.But I’m also aware that God gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason, so I listen to women more knowledgeable than myself on things that impact upon their daily lives. The space that Dr Waiton inhabited, in expressing his opinion, is a comforatable place that I know only too well. It’s the lads down the boozer, watching the football results on a Saturday afternoon, it’s best mates meeting up for a coffee and a chinwag and it’s the th hole of any golf club.It’s the safe places men go to as they inceasingly struggle to make sense of gender-neutral toilets and deal with the daily fear of saying the wrong thing in a world we increasingly struggle to understand. It is, all joking aside, an emerging mental health issue – but that’s for another day. No doubt, some of us feel a bit irritated about the prevalence of women’s football, especially trying to work out what Champions League fixtures are what – but it’s not worth getting your knickers in a twist over. So wind your neck in.: Scotland Women reach highest ever place in Fa rankingsTo my knowledge, no-one has thrown a coconut onto the pitch as happened at the recent Edinburgh Derby match or attacked a player at a women’s football match.On a broader note, the relevant voices that need to be heard and the irony of writing this, as a middle-aged man in a column in a national newspaper, is not lost on me – are female ones. Having men of a certain age write opinion pieces about topics like the #MeToo movement, which shines a light on sexual abuse, doesn’t add much to the debate.These types of columns are iniably along the lines of “I witnessed it but did nothing or I wouldn’t fancy dating much these days – it must be murder for young guys trying to pull a burd”. Unless it’s from the likes of Harvey Weinstein explaining his alleged bad behaviour and the reasons for it ... we’d all like to read that.Now, please don’t get the wrong impression that I’m writing this as some kind of big sook attempting to curry favour with the female population.I’m a caring sharing s new man who genuinely believed lasagne was something only women ate until I reached the age of  as I gleefully tucked in to my steak pie.I still ask young peoplethey’re going to the “dancing” and – unlike one male colleague, who shall remain nameless – refuse to start using the term “men’s football” ... gies peace. Have we to start saying female models as well No, the point I’m making is that it feels a bit snidey to be standing there, waiting to burst the bubble on not just feminist issues but more mundane things that women like and enjoy. I was going to write something about the hit TV show Fleabag, loved by women everywhere, but thought better of it as no-one wants to hear my opinion on that – like the first series, not sure about the second, there I’ve said it. Damn.But, perhaps it’s time for men of a certain vintage, and I include myself in this, to realise women aren’t hanging on to our every word, they never were. We’re increasingly redundant and no amount of chiding will change that.

The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe .

If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory.

Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind.

Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .My final word here . Given a choice of Nigel Farage, Johnathon Wills or Gary RobinsonI would choose Farage without question. Ex Councillors with a history of outright dishonestyor complete turncoat behaviour , Farage for me warts and all, any time.I do not agree with all Farage has done and said, but I find no lack of integrity in him, which in the atmosphere of today#s politics is refreshing.I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace..."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/SKY-ARTS-SARA-OUSSAIDEN-4.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion.

He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens.

It spreads either through direct contact with an infected person or through the air when the patient coughs or sneezes.“It causes high fever and rash that usually passes in about seven to ten days without causing further problems, but it can also be very serious, with some people developing complications, such as infections of the ears, lungsand brain .“Unfortunately, people can die from measles. The video aims to highlight the signs and symptoms and inform that the safest and most effective way to prevent measles is to ensure you are fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.”Due to lower levels of MMR vaccine uptake in children and young people in some countries, measles continues to circulate. Anyone who has not received two doses of MMR vaccine is at risk. The MMR vaccine has proven to be a safe and effective way to help protect against measles, mumps and rubella.“Thanks to the high proportion of people in Northern Ireland making the positive decision to get the MMR vaccine over the past decades, cases of these three illnesses here have fallen signicantly. However, these diseases have not gone away and some countries are experiencing outbreaks of measles.“The MMR vaccine is available free of charge as part of the routine immunisation schedule. Children should receive one dose of MMR just after their first birthday and a second dose at three years and four months of age. Anyone who is not surethey are fully-vaccinated should check with their GP practice. If you haven’t had your kids vaccinated, contact your GP surgery to make arrangement for them to get the MMR and help to provide them and those around them with the best protection.”The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose sneezing sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light a high temperaturea cough.To view the video see www.pha.site MMRvimeoFor more information on measles, mumps and rubella see www.pha.site mmr.PHA programme to tackle type  diabetes Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"pha programme to tackle type 2 diabetes","story":"A new programme to tackle the increasing prevalence of type  diabetes has been launched by the Public Health Agency.

Type  diabetes accounts for  per cent of all cases and is a serious and progressive condition. The disease can lead to early loss of le, cause preventable sight loss in working age people, and is a major contributor to kidney failure, heart attack, stroke and even amputation, yet the illness is often preventable by adopting healthier lestyle changes.The new diabetes prevention programme is aimed at people who have been identied as pre-diabetic – those who have been tested and have a blood sugar level slightly above the normal range – by their nurse, pharmacist or doctor. Trudy Brown, regional type  diabetes prevention programme manager at the PHA, said: “Often, by making simple changes to lestyle, losing weight, adopting a healthier diet and increasing physical activity, people can alter a type two diabetes diagnosis or at least postpone it signicantly.”Participant on the Newtownards programme, Margaret McAllister, aged , discovered she was pre-diabetic via a routine blood test. She said: “Being diagnosed as pre-diabetic was a shock but also an important warning call. “I was then given an opportunity to take part in the diabetes prevention programme.

It literally has changed my le.”Diabetes UK assistant director for local impact, Dr David Chaney, said: “We only have to look at the startling yearly increase in number of people being diagnosed with type  diabetes to know that we cannot ignore this very serious condition. We know that three in five cases of type  can be prevented or delayed by eating well, being active and achieving a healthy weight, so there is hope for the future. The more we know about diabetes the better we can fight it together, so find outyou are at risk and ask about your local diabetes prevention programme.”The diabetes prevention programme is currently up and running across all five trust areas. People can be referred to the programme by a nurse, pharmacist or doctor.The programme is delivered over a nine month period and is free of charge.

Our defending in the second half wasn’t good enough. We defended too deep, especially playing with the wind.“The amount of chances we had was enough to win two games. It was the same last week– we can’t concede three goals and expect to win matches.“We’ve lacked it all season. Even at - with five minutes to go, we had two great chances. We wouldn’t have taken a point and move on. At this level, we have to take those chances. I’ve said before, the commitment hasn’t been there this season, we hadn’t trained enough and we’ve been found out.“I can’t make excuses for the players anymore. “We are seven points behind with four games to go. We need to win three of them. It is up to myself to lt the team. We play Portstewart twice, Annagh is obviously a tough one and hopefully we can take it to the last game against Distillery.

Even though the terms of the Good Friday Agreement allow me to claim Irish citizenship, EU residency seems to be a sticking point for them.”He continued: “I think it raises questions about the wider impact of Brexit on people here.

And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Campaigners keen for resolution of baby post mortems  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed news that an all-island solution is being considered to address concern over the controversial decision to send babies to England for post-mortem examination.An interim service currently results in babies being sent to the Alder Hey Childrenrsquos Hospital in Liverpool due to workforce issues.Health chiefs say the arrangement with the specialist Liverpool hospital has been necessary to ensure what it describes as a ldquorobust perinatal and paediatric pathology service continues in Northern Ireland.The Down Community Health Committee has voiced concern about the traumatic impact on families who have to travel with their babies to England for post-mortem, describing the practice as ldquoinhumanersquo.The issue was one of several campaigners were keen to discuss with Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly, but due to diary commitments, he was unable to meet them.But,in a letter to the health grouprsquos chairman, Eamonn McGrady, Mr Pengelly confirmed that the government department was very aware that changes to paediatric and perinatal pathology services ldquomay add to the distress experienced by families at a devastating time in their lives and this is extremely regrettable.His letter continues: ldquoHealth and Social CareNI has been liaising closely with key charities and families who have been affected by bereavement to ensure the arrangements are as sensitive and respectful as possible.Mr Pengelly said that looking at the longer to medium term, health officials from Northern Ireland and the Republic will investigate the feasibility of an all-island approach to the delivery of paediatric pathology services.He explained that following on from engagement the Health and Social Care Board has had with colleagues in the Republic, the issue was recently discussed by chief medical officers and senior officials from health departments on either side of the border.But Mr Pengelly warned it was important to acknowledge that any potential solution was ldquounlikely to be deliverable in the immediate future due to current capacity constraints in the Republic and the time required for new trainees to specialise in this area.His letter adds: ldquoIn the meantime, HSC will work closely with the Royal Colleges and training organisations to encourage and support training in this specialty in the future.ldquoWork is also underway to assess the feasibility of using emerging technologies which could potentially provide parents with many of the answers they need, which could be provided locally. This work will continue over the coming months.Mr McGrady described the option of delivering an all-island solution as ldquological and believes that it would be welcomed.ldquoIt is clear from Mr Pengellyrsquos letter that there isnrsquot the capacity in the South to deliver the all-island service at the moment.

This bacteria increases the rate of lung decline and puts him at a greater risk to other infections.The hopes of Lorcaacutenrsquos parents crumbled when they heard last week that the house purchase, made possible by Jenrsquos parents, had fallen through due to a legal issue.Then just five days later, the couple learnt that the intensive antibiotic treatment that Lorcaacuten had been receiving over the past three months had failed to treat the bacteria.Jen told the Recorder last night that she and her husband ldquowere at their wits end at the current impasse.ldquoThe medical team are going to try two weeks of a dferent nebulised antibiotic with Lorcaacuten and thenit still there, itrsquos two weeks of IV treatment in hospital, she explained. ldquoThey will try alternative antibiotics and treatment for the next six months. It is such bad timing with the house falling through last week.ldquoWe just think he could be on Orkambi right nowwe were across the border.ldquoItrsquos such a hard thing to talk about to people at the moment about that the treatment not working and hard to explain as Lorcaacuten looks so well.ldquoI havenrsquot been out much since the news and when I went to one of Lorcaacutenrsquos wee groups all I could do is cry.An option for the young couple is to possibly consider is making a permanent move to Louth and sell their Downpatrick home.Lorcaacuten was diagnosed with cystic fibroris at  days old. It is a genetic condition that causes the body to produce thick mucus, which mainly affects the respiratory and digestive system but also affects multiple organs throughout the body.Orkambi is the only drug of its type available to treat the causes and symptoms of CF for children as young as Lorcaacuten.It costs pound, per year to treat a CF patient and parents claim it can add  years on to a CF patientrsquos le expectancy.It was licensed for - year-olds by the European Medicines Agency in Europe in January , and was again licensed for - year-olds in January.While thousands of parents of CF patients throughout the UK believe that it will treat the underlying cause of CF, not just the symptoms, it has not yet been been approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellencefor England and Wales.NICE has also failed to reach a purchase agreement with the drugrsquos manufacturer Vertex.The Scottish Medicines Consortium recently introduced Orkambi on a case by case basis for interim access.However, Lorcaacutenrsquos parents are so desperate to get the drug for him that they, along with other CF parents here, have been calling for Stormont to adopt a similiar arrangement.The  year-old mum of two admitted that she had made a desperate call to the Permanent Health Secretary Richard Pengellyrsquos office last week and burst into tears talking to his secretary.Mr Pengellyrsquos office sent a letter on April  in reply to the motherrsquos latest enquiry regarding Orkambi for Northern Ireland which stated: lsquoThis is a dficult issue which includes consideration of questions relating to cost and clinical effectiveness and access to commercially confidential information, which adds further complexity. However, I would hope that these discussions will be concluded as soon as practically possible.rsquoThe couple say that they feel that their options are limited, particularly in the absence of a Stormont executive and the ongoing uncertainity regarding Brexit.Jen said: ldquoI blame Brexit as everyone is waiting around to see what happens and I think Stormont would have been up and running againit hadnrsquot been for that.A recent petition to have Orkambi introduced in line with other EC countries has gained more than , signatures to have it debated in parliament.ldquoThe petition getting , signatures last week is the only good news we have had, but the earliest it can happen is June, said Jen.ldquoI would like to thank everyone who as signed the petition as we know that a high percentage of those who did came from Northern Ireland.Jen, in agreement with her husband, has been very vocal in telling Lorcaacutenrsquos story to the media but says itrsquos a position she would rather not have to take.ldquoItrsquos very, very hard to stay positive at the moment and very hard to keep going with Lorcaacutenrsquos treatment when you feel that itrsquos not working. The treatment so far has only kept the levels of the bacteria at a low level, not to clear it up, she said.ldquoI hate having to spill my guts to the media but the reason for sharing his story is to implore the public, politicians and media to support the Orkambi Now campaign..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 10%2C 1979  ","story":"MOURNES mdash A full-scale operation was launched on Monday to bring  frightened schoolchildren down to safety from the blizzard-swept Mourne Mountains.Amid blinding snow and freezing mist, two local rescue teams struggled to reach three parties of children who got into dficulties when preparing for the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme.The Mourne Rescue Team, led by Mr Teddy Hawkins, set out to rescue two of the parties and a team from Ardnabannon Outdoor Pursuit Centre went out to help the third party.The rescue drama began when three young climbers scrambled down from the Mournes and telephoned Newcastle police with the news that a  year-old girl had collapsed at Millstone Mountain on Donard.When the Mourne team arrived the girl, suffering from exposure, had already been put into a sleeping bag and bivouac by her colleagues.

Since the young entrepreneur began Ryanrsquos Cookie Box with the help of his mum, Hazel, he has been hitting the headlines.Ryan, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, won an award in his very first year in business. Less than a fortnight ago, he was the proud recipient of a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Civic Award.In the run-up to Motherrsquos Day, he raised a whopping pound, for two childrenrsquos charities with his treats and tray-bakes, which were sold from an honesty box at the bottom of the driveway at his house.The money, which includes over pound which he earned from his specially created Tfany-styled, bow-wrapped Motherrsquos Day mini-hampers, will be shared between the Childrenrsquos Heart Beat Clinic and the Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos facility at Daisy Lodge in Newcastle.Mum Hazel described the Friday before Motherrsquos Day as a ldquomarathon baking day in which she and Ryan prepared shortbread caramel brownies and chocolate Rice Krispie buns and Fteens made with Turkish Delights.ldquoThey were all sold in a matter of hours, she said. ldquoWe work together because there is such a demand.ldquoAll you do is stop the car, select what you want from the honesty box which stands at the bottom of our drive and leave the appropriate money.ldquoWe have found the community here is swimming with good will and generosity. And we know of people who come from as far as Ballymena to purchase treats.Customers include people driving by in cars and tractors, police, families with buggies, walkers and horse riders mdash so many riders in fact that the Bogues family have now built a mounting block to help the riders get back in their saddles.Hazel said: ldquoIt helps that Ryan loves food, especially food which has a permeation of chocolate and butter, and he really enjoys baking. It works depending on how much time we have and what ingredients are on special offer.ldquoAs you can see from our selection on offer, we actively support chocolate. All our profits go to charity, and we will always let the public know the charity of the month, both on Facebook and at the Cookie Box itself.Hazel continued: ldquoWe ask customers to cover the price of the baking and packaging, and then add a donation.There is a sheet at the front of the box that explains everything. But basically, we mark each packet on the ingredients sticker with a coloured dot.Hazel is a nurse at the Marie Curie Hospice, which will receive the proceeds of Easterrsquos business at Ryanrsquos Cookie Box.Much further away mdash , miles to be precise mdash a health centre on the island of Madagascar now stands equipped with a brand new water well thanks to Ryanrsquos efforts.Of course, its not all work and no play for the chocolate-loving duo who have raised an estimated pound, over the past  months.Hazel said: ldquoSometimes we get presents.

behind the Belfast Agreement has accused powerful US politician Nancy Pelosiof using the deal to #blackmail# the UK over Brexit.Sir Reg Empey was speaking after she warned there would be no post-Brexit trade deal between America and the UKany “harm” comes to the  accord.Mrs Pelosi, a Democrat who is speaker of the US House of Representatives, spoke at the Republic’s Department of Foreign Affairs at the start of a two-day visit to Ireland.According to the Press Association, she said of a trade deal: “That’s just not on the cards,there’s any harm done to the Good Friday accords... don’t even think about that.”The BBC further quoted her as saying “it is very hard to pass a trade bill in the congress... butthere were any weakening of the Good Friday accords, there would be no chance whatsoever”.She also said the deal “ended  years of conflict” and is “a model to the world”, the BBC added.UUP peer Lord Empey – who was party’s lead negotiator on the parts of the agreement which set up Northern Ireland’s government structures – hit out at her for her “complete misunderstanding” of the  deal.He said congress had been “hypnotised” by the views espoused by the Irish government, which has been “throughout this process using the Good Friday Agrement as a tool”.In short, Mrs Pelosi’s position seems to be the UK should do what the Republic’s government wants, or forfeit a trade deal – a position Lord Empey likened to “an attempt to blackmail people”.He wondered where Mrs Pelosi had developed her understanding of the agreement’s content, noting that the current Dublin administration does not contain anyone who helped forge the deal, and that Sinn Fein were absent from key parts of the talks – and in any case “didn’t support the agreement at the time” anyway.“I’d be helpfulthe speaker actually spoke to some people who negotiated the agreement,” he said.“Because some of the proposals in the Withdrawal Agreement – including the backstop – actually are an attack on [the  deal]...“I’ve never come across a time when there’s been so many experts on the Good Friday Agreement, and yet most of the people who’re spouting about it weren’t within a mile of it.”Primark

prime minister to get on with leaving the EU.It was the first party in Northern Ireland to nominate a candidate for European elections it hoped it would not have to fight.Diane Dodds is an outgoing MEP and pledged to honour the result of the Brexit referendum.Leader Arlene Foster said: “We want a very strong message to go back to Brussels and London to get on with leaving the EU.”Northern Ireland’s three seats in Brussels have historically been ided between the DUP, Sinn Fein and the Ulster Unionists.Sinn Fein’s Martina Anderson is to run again while veteran Ulster Unionist Jim Nicholson is stepping aside after decades in the European Parliament.Mrs Dodds said: “We have a parliament that has tried every manoeuvre to try to thwart the will of the people.“We in this election are asking people to come out to reinforce that message that the UK voted to leave the EU.“We therefore should leave the EU and we should leave as one nation.“We want the UK to leave as one and we want our prime minister to get on with the job of doing it.”Poll results in Northern Ireland have traditionally ided along unionist and nationalist lines.Mrs Foster said people would want to register their support for the UK’s Union in this election and reiterated the need to deal with the Irish border backstop.ATM ripped from wall of NI town is recovered a short distance away Coremetrics

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s. This is up to five times the UK average.The academic rigour extends to the staff too.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Under consumer law, firms may be entitled to ask customers to pay a cancellation fee to cover their losses, but the amount they keep must be in proportion to what they are losing.Cancellation terms that do not follow this approach are likely to be unfair and businesses cannot rely on them to resolve claims or disputes with customers.A survey of , people for the CMA found that % of people believe they should get all or most of their money backthey cancel and the business re-sells their booking.Some % think it is unfairthey have to pay part of the cost of a booking when they cancel and % say that travel and holiday businesses do not always make it as easy to cancel a booking as they should.Of those with experience of cancelling a booking, one in five felt they had been treated unfairly.Examples of unfair terms can include those which allow a business to take a large, upfront deposit and refuse to refund any of the customerrsquos moneythey cancel, regardless of the amount the business is losing or the reason for the customer cancelling.Paul Latham, the CMArsquos director of strategy and communications, said: ldquoNobody wants to cancel a trip or holiday, butyou have to, itrsquos important that you are treated fairly and donrsquot lose out more than is absolutely necessary.ldquoFair terms are a legal requirement as well as helping reassure customers that theyrsquore dealing with a company they can trust.

The small print really can make a big dference.Association of British Travel Agentschief executive Mark Tanzer said: ldquoThere are circumstances when a cancellation charge may apply, but it must genuinely reflect the costs of cancellations faced by the travel company. We always encourage people to take out travel insurance as soon as they book their holiday, which should protect them from the costs for most cancellations.Which  Travel editor Rory Boland said: ldquoHaving to call off a long-awaited trip away is bad enough, but itrsquos made even worse when holidaymakers are forced to hand over large sums of money unexpectedly because the cancellation policy is unfair, unclear or buried deep within the terms and conditions.ldquoItrsquos time for travel firms to up their game.

The winner chose to accept the cash prize.The ASA said the complainant had entered the promotion in the hope of winning the castle.It said: ldquoWe understood that at the end of the competition three cash prizes were awarded at the value of pound,, pound, and pound, instead of the advertised prize, because the minimum number of entries had not been reached, and that the advertiser had offered the winner a share of the property.ldquoHowever, we considered that a share of the property or any cash alternative that was less than the value of the property, were not reasonable equivalents to the prize as advertised.ldquoBecause neither the advertised prize nor a reasonable alternative had been awarded, we concluded that the promotion had not been administered fairly and was in breach of the code.Mrs DeVere said in a statement: ldquoIt is fair enough to challenge a competition or any unfairness and it should have taken the ASA a heartbeat to look at our site and see that from the beginning everything was spelled out, including that a cash prize to the value of tickets .

Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades.

That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.
