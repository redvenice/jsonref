I feel happy for him that he\u0027s in a place now where he\u0027s probably going to be eternally young\u0027.          Dale Winton never got over finding his mother (together when they were three) dead after her suicide when he was and he also deeply regretted not telling the Thunderball actress he was gay when he had the chanceMr Allen also revealed Dale would hint at killing himself because of his medical problems, emotional problems and \u0027insecurities\u0027 and had asked him repeatedly: \u0027Do you think there\u0027d be a turn out at the funeral? Please make sure everyone turns up\u0027.He added: \u0027Deep down he was a bit lonely. He needed a partner. He has had some bad picks\u0027. In the 2016 Loose Women interview Dale  admitted he was too depressed to leave the house after a messy break-up with another man but never revealed publicly who he was dating.He said: \u0027It (depression) was triggered by a very bad break-up. God, I can\u0027t half pick them\u0027.\u0027People are amazed at my taste. I like them if they\u0027ve not got a tooth in their head, tattooes, the lot. If they\u0027ve got emotional problems, sign me up. If there\u0027s a man over 45 with a beard I\u0027m there\u0027.Neighbours have said that Dale \u0027wasn\u0027t quite right\u0027 and \u0027he did not look that great\u0027 before his death and police and paramedics were called to his home at 4.10pm yesterday after he was found dead inside.An only child, Dale\u0027s happy childhood ended when his father Gary collapsed and died on the day of his bar mitzvah when he was 13 and he came home aged 21 to find his mother Sheree had killed herself with a drug overdose in her bedroom. His own sudden death yesterday came just a month before his 63rd birthday and the 41st anniversary of his actress mother\u0027s suicide, which he admitted he \u0027never got over\u0027.Dale\u0027s closest friend David Walliams said today: \u0027He found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027 and Dale\u0027s cousin Madeleine Trehearne, 65, told MailOnline: \u0027We feel that he died far too young and we\u0027re really cut up about it.\u0027 Dale started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he \u0027wouldn\u0027t leave the house\u0027 because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. But this year he relaunched his career with a US travel show on Channel 5 called Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive.  The final episodes will now be shown at an \u0027appropriate time in the future\u0027.          This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive (pictured) but he died before the series was shown in full   TV star Dale Winton has died at the age of 62 at his London home (pictured in his last public appearance in July 2016 with friend David Walliams), and right a month later          Flowers for the \u0027kindest man I know\u0027 were left on his doorstep today by a friend nicknamed \u0027GoGo\u0027 by the starDale had moved to a five bedroom semi detached home in Whetstone worth around £1million and his silver Range Rover with a personalised number plate is still on the drive. Next door neighbour Evelyn Sawers, 68, said: \u0027Dale had only been living there about a month. \u0027He kept to himself, occasionally I\u0027d see him on his door step and he\u0027d say \u0027hello\u0027 but other than that I didn\u0027t see much of him.           Dale\u0027s big break came with Supermarket Sweep, which saw contestants racing around a supermarket collecting items. He hosted the show from 1993 to 2001, and was involved in a 2007 reboot\u0027Yesterday there were four ambulances and a lot of police and I wondered what had happened. \u0027There was a tall blonde woman by his front door talking to a policeman. She might have been a relative. \u0027It wasn\u0027t until I saw the news that I realised Dale had died. It\u0027s a shame as he seemed a nice man. I recognised him from the television\u0027. Former neighbours of Winton in Central London have paid their tributes to the TV star.\u0027I saw him a few weeks ago,\u0027 said a woman who lives on York Terrace East and declined to be identified.\u0027He was delightful, always very kind, but he hadn\u0027t been the same since Cilla (Black) died. Since then, he spent a lot more time in Florida.\u0027A man who lives opposite Winton\u0027s former residence said: \u0027He was a very nice man. Very agreeable and cheerful. He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. Last night Winton\u0027s agent confirmed his death at home at the age of 62, but no further details about how or why were given. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious. He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans. He devoted his life to making everyone else happy, his friends, the public \u0026amp his godsons, even though he found it hard to be happy himself. I pray he has found peace\u0027. In June 2016, two months before he was last seen in public, he said: \u0027I would not leave the house for five years. I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.\u0027A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027Comedian David Walliams also said he was \u0027heartbroken\u0027 to hear of the death of his friend, who spoke openly about his battle with depression two years ago.But describing how much fun he was to be around he said: \u0027One night Dale \u0026amp I were going out to dinner \u0026amp he stopped off on the way to buy diet lemonade from a corner shop. He was in there about 20 minutes. When he finally got back in the car I asked \u0027what took you so long?\u0027 \u0026amp he said \u0027sorry David I am very big with the Indian community!\u0027In another anecdote he said: \u0027One afternoon Dale \u0026amp I were out shopping \u0026amp some policeman were standing on the street corner. He gave them a huge wave \u0026amp called out \u0027hello loves, hello darlings!\u0027 I asked why he was saying hello. He replied \u0027always wave at policemen David.

I had a shoulder problem and a knee problem, so I took a break to get myself sorted.\u0027It meant I couldn\u0027t exercise, so I\u0027ve been dieting like crazy, I\u0027m one of those people who work to live rather than live to work, so it\u0027s been very hard work – I\u0027m used to being in a studio but this is something wholly different\u0027.                                                    He was born in Marylebone,London, in May 1955 to Gary and Sheree, an actress.Writing in his autobiography, Dale Winton: My Story, in 2002, the much loved star touchingly described his relationship with his beloved mother.\u0027In truth though, I always felt my Mum would forgive me anything. She believed in boundaries and was strict, but her love for me was real and unconditional.\u0027His parents orced when he was 10 and his father died three years later on the day of Winton\u0027s bar mitzvah.Just days after he turned 21, Winton discovered his mother, who he adored, had died after taking an overdose of prescription medication.Distraught, Winton never fully got over the loss of his beloved mother and soon after her death sough help from the Samaritans. \u0027I had some really desperate personal moments soon after Mum died,\u0027 he said in his autobiography. \u0027On one occasion, I telephoned the Samaritans and went to see one of their volunteers. \u0027Whatever people say to comfort one, suicide is chiefly thought of as the ultimate rejection of loved ones, as well as of life, and those who are left need time to get beyond these thoughts His career in showbusiness began when he worked as a DJ on the London club scene before he moved into work in radio and television.His big break came with Supermarket Sweep, which saw contestants racing around a supermarket collecting items.He hosted the show from 1993 to 2001, and was involved in a 2007 reboot.From there, Winton moved onto prime-time shows including The National Lottery\u0027s In It To Win It and went onto host his own Christmas specials as well as celebrity guest shows.           Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive - Ep 4 - Dale and biker Carl at a Harley Davidson biker rally before Dale has a ride on the Harley - it would be one of the very last shows he would ever make  Pals: Davina, pictured with the late star in 1998, counted herself among his many showbiz palsShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeNail-biting CCTV shows schoolgirl hiding from gang behind low wallDale Winton opens up about his battle with depression on Loose WomenSteve Allen pays emotional tribute to Dale WintonEMT speaks out after rescue attempt on Southwest Airlines flightFlight attendants urge passengers to \u0027breathe\u0027 on Southwest planeFast and the Furious wannabe drivers almost cause serious accidentsHusky goes for a ride with his owner on a motorcycleDigger tears down ruins after man burnt down £320,000 marital home    Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive - Dale with Chip and Dale in Walt Disney\u0027s Animal Kingdom.

He said that was the point he should have said, \u0027Mum, I\u0027ll tell you: I\u0027m gay\u0027.  In recent years the once prolific star disappeared from TV screens and in an interview earlier this year he claimed he was keeping a low profile after undergoing several rounds of surgery.In 2015 he sparked concern after failing to attend the funeral of Cilla Black, who was one of his closest friends.A year later, he appeared on TV\u0027s Loose Women and revealed he had been secretly battling depression after going through a difficult break up.He told the show: \u0027I should have taken myself off the TV but I didn\u0027t.

He had been there for years. At least 17 years.\u0027You could always tell when he was in, because he had such a loud voice. He didn\u0027t particularly have parties or lots of people over though.\u0027I\u0027ll always remember him as a very pleasant man, and I\u0027m just sorry I didn\u0027t get to say goodbye.\u0027   Dale\u0027s family album: Unseen photos offer a glimpse into TV host Winton\u0027s childhood with his beloved mother and fatherThese unseen family photos show Dale Winton before he was famous - including heartwarming snaps of him with his glamorous actress mother who committed suicide.One photo shows him in London\u0027s Cumberland hotel in 1959, sitting between his doting mum Sheree and father Gary enjoying a Christmas meal.The chubby four-year-old is holding his tragic mother\u0027s hand while they all smile and pose wearing silly hats for the hotel photographer.

His father died suddenly when he was 13 and his mother killed herself when he was 21But his private life was a much unhappier sparked by the sudden and tragic deaths of his parents. His friend of 50 years, LBC DJ Steve Allen, said today: \u0027Deep down he was a bit lonely.

Should her wish be granted?This group of nations - from Canada to Cameroon, Australia to Antigua - is made up of countries and small islands which Britain inherited, conquered and used to advantage as we built an Empire.We used their people as slaves and cheap labour. We plundered their resources, dumped our convicts on their shores and took hundreds of years to belatedly allow them to claim independence.There’s a strong argument that- in the 21st century - the Commonwealth represents a paternalistic, outdated view of the world.The Queen tells world leaders that it is her \u0027sincere wish\u0027...Theresa May promises to introduce a ban on the sale of...Share this articleNevertheless, ever since the Queen took over as Head following the death of her father George VI, she has enchanted and beguiled the most republican of member states.Elizabeth made the Commonwealth her special project, travelling thousands of miles to visit the 53 territories and realms, and has shown huge compassion and understanding of the issues facing its disparate members.          Her majesty and the heir to the throne (pictured together) are followed out of the ballroom by the Duchess of Wales following today\u0027s Commonwealth summitNow, at 92 on Saturday, she’s anxious to step down, and gave up long-haul travel in 2013.Unlike most of the Commonwealth leaders, Elizabeth was born into immense privilege - she inherited wealth and far-flung places that have few ties to the United Kingdom.There are plenty of reasons why the Commonwealth should not work as a loose grouping of states - but amazingly, it continues to survive, providing a useful forum which draws countries together, rather than apart.Given that the British throne rules a diminishing number of Commonwealth nations - why should the next leader come from the House of Windsor?Would it not be fairer to let the Commonwealth Heads of Government hold a secret ballot and choose who should replace the Queen?The UK’s current immigration crisis - over the British subjects who arrived to work from the Caribbean as part of the ‘Windrush’ scheme, is an embarrassing disgrace during this week of Commonwealth ‘unity’.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe Windrush workers were invited to the UK to help rebuild Britain after the war, and are valued members of society. They were not shirkers, but newcomers who have enriched British culture.A blame game is going on, as politicians squabble over who is responsible for destroying the entry papers of over 50,000 Windrush immgrants, many of whom have been refused the right to work, to claim benefits and receive healthcare, and to obtain a British passport, all because the original documents showing their status cannot be found. Some have even been deported by mistake.This unfortunate cockup reveals how some white British politicians and the Establishment secretly view the Commonwealth.At the Commonwealth Games in Australia the other week, many of the British medal winners will be the grandchildren of Windrush families - we’re proud to call them British when it suits us.The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breeches.          The Commonwealth countries need a leader who can speak out in these situations, and demand justice, not someone served by footmen in knee breechesIn 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies and military events all over the world.The Commonwealth includes countries who still enforce the death penalty, who are not receptive to gay rights and who don’t think women should be allowed abortions. Navigating all that and pushing for change requires diplomacy, tact, and people skills - something which the Queen possesses in spades.To succeed her, a career politician or a charismatic leader is required. The only downside? They might not own palaces, sycophantic staff or be able to afford champagne and swanky canapes.Is Prince Charles truly the best candidate? He rarely looks at ease in these situations, his life has been spent waiting on the sidelines, being indulged and spoilt, and his relationship with his children has only recently improved.His relationship with his former wife was disastrous. Sensing that the handover might be tricky with some Commonwealth members, the Queen has been using her brand to reinforce the notion that the Royal family are willing to take on new challenges involving young people and sexual equality.Highly paid PR people and Private Secretaries are mounting a charm offensive to launch a second wave of junior Royals into key roles.Princess Eugenie - 8th in line to the throne and 15 other Commonwealth realms, according to her Dad’s website - turned up at a reception this week wearing a short dress and scuffed suede boots - hardly a suitable outfit for someone aspiring to ‘lead’ another democracy.Prince Harry - 5th in line to the UK throne and 15 countries - has just been appointed Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by his granny.He introduced Meghan Markle, his bride to be, to the assembled youth leaders as if they were leading a world-wide crusade for gay rights. It all sounded a bit like a rehearsal for their wedding next month.The notion that Meghan Markle will be touring the world telling other countries about human rights is patronising in the extreme.I don’t doubt for a moment that the couple are sincere and well-intentioned - but will any political leader be swayed by a woman from a TV soap? You might as well send Bono or Sting.           In 2018, the Commonwealth can’t re-inforce the stereotype of a Regal head, someone who dishes out patronage and attends meaningless ceremonies  all over the world"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/19/21/4B54857D00000578-5635235-image-a-151_1524170360667.jpg","title":"The Queen Prince Charles welcome world leaders Buckingham Palace state dinner","story":"Look blooming beautiful like Beatrice in a floral gown by Needle \u0026amp ThreadNow reduced to £212.50!With the Duchess of Cambridge on maternity leave, we\u0026#39ve been looking to the rest of the Royal family for some style inspiration recently.So far this week Megan Markle, Sophie Wessex and Princess Eugenie have carried out engagements wearing labels like Altuzarra, Black Halo, Suzannah and Whistles, but how lovely is Princess Beatrice\u0026#39s dress here?

He always gave me a big hello on the street. He was very neighbourly.\u0027A bouquet of white roses lay on the doorstep of Winton\u0027s old house with a card that said: \u0027The kindest man I knew. Always in my heart.\u0027 It was signed \u0027Go Go\u0027. In a moving tribute to his friend David Walliams tweeted today: \u0027Dale was the best company, always outrageous \u0026amp hilarious. He adored being in show business \u0026amp loved meeting fans.

I didn\u0027t want to put one foot in front of the other outside the house. I had a bad break up and I had health issues and I thought, \u0027I want to withdraw\u0027.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. Speaking in his final TV interview in 2016 he revealed he could not meet anyone to spend his life because he spent too much time chasing \u0027mean and nasty\u0027 men.He said: \u0027Nobody wants a camp, over 60-year-old man. I can\u0027t go on dating sites. I\u0027m quite well known so the minute you see the picture it\u0027s desperately unattractive to another gay man to find a guy in showbusiness on there\u0027.

I feel happy for him that he\u0027s in a place now where he\u0027s probably going to be eternally young\u0027.Mr Allen also revealed Winton would hint at killing himself because of his medical problems, emotional problems and \u0027insecurities\u0027 and had asked him repeatedly: \u0027Do you think there\u0027d be a turn out at the funeral? Please make sure everyone turns up\u0027.          Dale Winton never got over finding his mother (together when they were three) dead after her suicide when he was and he also deeply regretted not telling the Thunderball actress he was gay when he had the chanceHe added: \u0027Deep down he was a bit lonely. He needed a partner. He has had some bad picks\u0027. In the 2016 Loose Women interview Winton admitted he was too depressed to leave the house after a messy break-up with another man but never revealed publicly who he was dating.He said: \u0027It (depression) was triggered by a very bad break-up. God, I can\u0027t half pick them\u0027.\u0027People are amazed at my taste. I like them if they\u0027ve not got a tooth in their head, tattooes, the lot. If they\u0027ve got emotional problems, sign me up. If there\u0027s a man over 45 with a beard I\u0027m there\u0027. Neighbours have said that Winton \u0027wasn\u0027t quite right\u0027 and \u0027he did not look that great\u0027 before his death and police and paramedics were called to his home at 4.10pm yesterday after he was found dead inside.An only child, Dale\u0027s happy childhood ended when his father Gary collapsed and died on the day of his bar mitzvah when he was 13 and he came home aged 21 to find his mother Sheree had killed herself with a drug overdose in her bedroom. His own sudden death yesterday came just a month before his 63rd birthday and the 41st anniversary of his actress mother\u0027s suicide, which he admitted he \u0027never got over\u0027.Winton started his career in local radio and had little work for eight years until he spent nearly a decade hosting Supermarket Sweep before fronting the National Lottery show In It To Win It on BBC1 for 14 years and the Pick of the Pops show on BBC Radio 2 for ten years.But the star, known for his sunny disposition, bright smile and tan, disappeared from public life two years ago admitting he \u0027wouldn\u0027t leave the house\u0027 because of depression and regrets that he had failed to admit he was gay until he was 45.A year earlier he failed to make it to his close friend Cilla Black\u0027s funeral, sparking concerns about his health, and had undergone four operations in four years to fix crippling pain in his knees and shoulders. But this year he relaunched his career with a US travel show on Channel 5 called Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive.  The final episodes will now be shown at an \u0027appropriate time in the future\u0027.In his 2002 autobiography he came out as gay but revealed his regret at not telling his mother before her death saying in 2008 that nobody had really ever asked him about his sexual orientation. This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive but he died before the series was shown in full. His friend Davina McCall led the tributes last night as she described him as a \u0027lovely, warm, kind, sensitive, generous soul with a touch of naughty!\u0027          This year he had relaunched his TV career with a new Channel 5 show Dale\u0027s Florida Fly Drive (pictured) but he died before the series was shown in full   TV star Dale Winton has died at the age of 62 at his London home (pictured in his last public appearance in July 2016 with friend David Walliams), and right a month later          Flowers for the \u0027kindest man I know\u0027 were left on his doorstep today by a friend nicknamed \u0027GoGo\u0027 by the star          Dale Winton, pictured at the 2003 British Soap Awards, died suddenly at his London flat, his agent has revealed and police are now investigating           David Walliams, who Winton counted among his closest friends, has given both tragic and hilarious insights into his life and personalityShocking moment man shoves Met Police officer off moving motorbikeEMT speaks out after rescue attempt on Southwest Airlines flightFlight attendants urge passengers to \u0027breathe\u0027 on Southwest planeNail-biting CCTV shows schoolgirl hiding from gang behind low wallSteve Allen pays emotional tribute to Dale WintonDale Winton opens up about his battle with depression on Loose WomenFast and the Furious wannabe drivers almost cause serious accidentsHusky goes for a ride with his owner on a motorcycleDigger tears down ruins after man burnt down £320,000 marital home    Dale Winton had appeared on the Loose Women in 2016, where he opened up about his battle with depressionPart of his problems concerned a difficult break up.He told the panel: \u0027I had a very bad year.

The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested  There could be little doubt about the prevailing view among the members as they assembled at Buckingham Palace yesterday morning for the opening ceremony of the largest Commonwealth summit in the organisation\u0027s history.It came despite reports claiming that some Commonwealth leaders remain \u0027underwhelmed\u0027 by the Prince of Wales, while senior Labour figures, including leader Jeremy Corbyn, have questioned whether he should be honoured with the role.It fell to the Maltese prime minister, as the Commonwealth\u0027s outgoing chair-in-office, to speak on behalf of his colleagues.\u0027We are elated by the vigour with which the Prince of Wales actively participates in Commonwealth affairs,\u0027 said Dr Joseph Muscat. \u0027We are certain that when he will be called upon to do so, he will provide solid and passionate leadership for our Commonwealth.\u0027It remains to be seen whether the leaders decide to formalise this intention in today\u0027s end-of-summit communique. Since there is no constitutional rule about the headship, there is no requirement to do so.And although there is no vacancy yet, this was still a landmark moment. The prince has been quietly assuming more and more of the monarch\u0027s duties – investitures, overseas tours and, most recently, honouring the fallen at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.           The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things But the Commonwealth question has always been studiously avoided. The prince has had to tread carefully, for fear of appearing too pushy on his mother\u0027s turf or, conversely, of appearing uninterested.Yet having visited 44 of the 53 nations of the Commonwealth (he has been to ten in the past year alone) and having known all its leaders since birth, he probably understands \u0027the club\u0027 better than anyone alive, with the exception of his parents.Yesterday he spoke fondly of what has been \u0027a fundamental feature of my life for as long as I can remember\u0027 and of bygone Commonwealth statesmen such as Pierre Trudeau, former prime minister of Canada, and Jomo Kenyatta, former president of Kenya. Both men\u0027s sons – Justin Trudeau and Uhuru Kenyatta – have since followed their fathers into politics. Both of them were seated on the stage yesterday with the other premiers. The Windsors are certainly not the only Commonwealth dynasty.The Queen\u0027s ringing endorsement of the prince was particularly striking because, until now, she has avoided interfering in the business side of things.Over nearly seven decades she has held this argumentative organisation-cum-clan together, listening to their troubles in endless private audiences, wining and dining them, breaking up fights and generally keeping the show on the road.But this was the nearest she has ever come to an instruction.Cleverly, she talked of the prince continuing her father\u0027s work as well as her own.  The Queen has told foreign dignitaries of her \u0027sincere wish\u0027 that they pick Prince Charles to take over as leader of the Commonwealth during a large summit at Buckingham Palace Commonwealth summits are unlike any other, not least because there are no interpreters. The family atmosphere was evident even before the start yesterday as the leaders gathered in the Blue Drawing Room at Buckingham Palace.Usually, royal guests in the state apartments stand around nervously, trying not to touch anything. This lot swaggered in, many giving each other bear hugs, and cheerfully plonked themselves down on priceless sofas and chairs, making themselves thoroughly at home.It is one of the reasons why the Queen has always enjoyed these summits, and why there was an added poignancy to yesterday\u0027s proceedings. For this was a farewell of sorts – not that anyone put it quite like that.The Queen, who celebrates her 92nd birthday tomorrow, no longer undertakes long-haul travel. These Commonwealth summits, held every other year, take place in Britain only every 20 years or so. The next one is scheduled for Malaysia, and the Prince of Wales will represent the Queen there.She will continue to play an active part in Commonwealth affairs and meet its leaders when they are in Britain. But her days of far-away summits are over.It explains why this gathering had attracted the largest number of premiers in Commonwealth history, with 47 heads of government present among 53 delegations.She attended her first gathering of its leaders as a princess, when her father, King George VI, created the modern organisation out of the remnants of the British Empire. There were only eight members of the Commonwealth when the Queen came to the throne.          Britain\u0027s Prince Charles greets India\u0027s Prime Narendra Modi in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner on Thursday night In 1953, she was the dazzling debutante head surrounded by grand old stagers like Churchill, Menzies and Nehru. She would entertain the Commonwealth prime ministers on their annual trips to London until they decided to rotate these gatherings among the member nations. In 1971 the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (or CHOGM) took place in Singapore.Prime Minister Edward Heath formally advised the Queen not to attend. He warned that there would be a row over British arms sales to South Africa and that there would be a toxic atmosphere – as indeed there was. The Commonwealth came close to imploding there and then.The Queen was adamant that she would never miss another one. She has been turning up ever since, holding her audiences, her banquets and her receptions (with the exception of 2013, when the new long-haul ban ruled out a journey to Sri Lanka). All through the 1970s and 80s, all through the bust-ups over Rhodesia and South Africa, she was there in the wings, defusing the tension, raising the tone, nudging the organisation towards consensus rather than polarisation.Along the way, the Commonwealth would enjoy great triumphs – notably the end of apartheid, the return of South Africa to \u0027the club\u0027 and the creation of an independent Zimbabwe.          The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall are pictured riding in a car along The Mall in London after the formal opening in Buckingham Palace of the Commonwealth Heads of Government MeetingThe fact that dozens of ex-colonies have maintained such a close bond with the once-loathed ex-imperial Crown has been, in no small part, down to the way the Queen has personally reframed that relationship.In recent years, the Commonwealth may have lost its way at a political level, eclipsed by a myriad of grander, flashier copycats – the G20, the EU and so on. Its critics suggest it is an outdated, clapped-out post-imperial has-been. But it still does its best work at the people-to-people level through numerous grass-roots associations, plugging away on tiny budgets.It has plenty of admirers and jealous rivals. The French have done their best to emulate it. There are many nations who want to join.This is a unique outfit with a unique character, forged through shared bonds of history, language, law and sacrifice. Last night\u0027s dinner was proof of that. State banquets at the Palace always have a U-shaped table with the Queen at the top. Not this one.     Last night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt Missing his Markle: Harry and William join the Queen as she...British fishing firm can appeal against a controversial...How and when will we know if Prince Charles will succeed the...King of Swaziland renames the country Kingdom of eSwatini to...Share this articleLast night, the Queen ordered round tables of ten so that no one was below the salt. She sat between Dr Muscat of Malta and president Adama Barrow of The Gambia (now a Commonwealth member once more, having recently ejected the madman who used to be in charge).All the Royal Family were there, with the exception of a convalescing Prince Philip and a heavily pregnant Duchess of Cambridge. Spread all around the Picture Gallery was that old ex-imperial family to which the Queen pledged herself on her 21st birthday.By tradition, a summit newcomer had been invited to raise the toast to the Queen at the black tie banquet.

You must be stupid\u0027. Canny, 33, a commodities broker from Essex, told MailOnline after the incident: \u0027Of course I\u0027d do it again. If it happened again tonight, I\u0027d do the same thing again and I wouldn\u0027t even think about it.\u0027He added: \u0027Why should I allow people to break into my property and damage my vehicle?

There were about 20 people watching in the end.\u0027 Before targeting the investment banker, de Silva and a pal stole over £1,000 in goods in thefts from Chelsea and Fulham residents earlier that night.          Former amateur rugby player Stephen Canny tackled the robbers in a pair of pyjama shortsOn Ellerby Street, Fulham, de Silva robbed lawyer Stephen Wisking and stole a Dell Laptop, an Apple iPad Pro, £100 euros, a blue canvas bags containing paperwork and another black bag from his BMW X5.He went on to Roskell Road, Putney, and stole Bose headphones and a red bag containing books and documents belonging to William Bond.In a third robbery at Beaufort Street, in Chelsea, he stole from Ashley Fromberg a black holdall and ID documents.The two Mercedes belonging to Stephen Canny and his girlfriend were the thieves\u0027 fourth target.He pinned de Silva onto the ground opposite Gordon Ramsay\u0027s Maze Grill restaurant in Chelsea, central London, as passersby watched on in horror at around 9.30pm on 7 March.          Mr Canny says he has four brothers so is not strangle to a bit of rough and tumbleMr Canny told MailOnline about why he tackled de Silva in an interview after the incident.He said  \u0027I got out the front door, one guy had smashed the window to my car. A second guy was smashing another vehicle, which was also an A-class Mercedes like mine.\u0027I came flying out wearing a pair of pyjama shorts and a summer jumper and one of them ran round the car and just came straight at me, which was the reason I managed to stop him.\u0027I used to play a lot of rugby, so I hit him with a shoulder and then I punched him a couple of times. I broke the visor clean off his helmet, which was one of those half-helmets with no jaw protector.\u0027He swung a quick sequence of frenetic punches, clearly shocked by my intervention. We exchanged a few blows, but the idea was simply to stop him. I didn\u0027t want to give him a kicking, but we did exchange blows.\u0027A second masked moped rider then stormed over to help his accomplice.He added: \u0027He grabbed my jumper and began to lay into me. I was fending one off and hitting the other one. Then I think it dawned on them. They thought, sh**, I\u0027ve just run into someone I don\u0027t want to be running into.\u0027Seeing he was outmatched, the second man got back onto his moped and raced away, leaving his partner facing Mr Canny alone.\u0027Not a lot was going through my mind,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027My only thought was, those absolute f****** b*******, breaking into my car. The second guy\u0027s hands were in back of my car.\u0027 Of the remaining suspect, he said: \u0027He was strong for small guy and from the look in his eyes I could tell he was off his head on something. He smelled strongly of marijuana.\u0027He was just lashing out at me and trying to push me against the wall. We started grappling and I tried to sweep him.\u0027It didn\u0027t work, but then I managed to get behind him and fold his body in two. I knew that he would eventually run out of steam.\u0027It was the sheer weight advantage allowed me to overpower him and stop him from getting away.\u0027We heard sirens. At that point he panicked, and for a good minute-and-a-half he was really kicking off to get away.\u0027Then he started apologising and offering to pay me and pay for the damage to the car.\u0027I told him to calm down and said I wasn\u0027t going to hurt him, but he had to stay here until the police came to take him away. I told him to stop fighting me, as I didn\u0027t want to have to hit him back.\u0027By this time, the man was sweating heavily and his helmet had entirely come off.

Piers with Wenger in 2000. He has since grown tired of his team\u0027s poor performances and has been calling for him to goThis season has been even worse than that.We\u0027re currently 6th in the League, out of both domestic competitions, and all that\u0027s left to play for is the Europa League, the ugly sister to the Cinderella-style Champions League that no big club wants to play in.As performances on the field have fallen, so has the size of the crowds.The Emirates stadium, supposedly our bold new platform to the elite of world football, has resembled a half-empty graveyard at times during recent games.Yet still Wenger\u0027s excuses have kept coming there\u0027s always a reason for our persistent failure in big competition, which has nothing to do with him.In the end, there is one statistic that says it all: Sir Alex Ferguson has won the Premier League five times since Wenger last won it, and he\u0027s been retired for five years.It\u0027s been so sad to see the slow, inexorable demise of our once great titan.          Some Arsenal fans have long waged a campaign calling for Wenger to be sackedArsenal legend Ian Wright put it well recently: \u0027Watching Wenger now is like witnessing the ageing Muhammad Ali against Larry Holmes or Brazil\u0027s Ronaldo when he got fat. The problem with Arsène is there is no one in his corner prepared to throw in the towel.\u0027Well, now he\u0027s done it himself.Or perhaps he was urged to throw it by board members at Arsenal? I know at least one who told me a few months ago he was hoping to persuade Wenger to finally see the writing on the wall.It doesn\u0027t really matter.Wenger\u0027s going and it\u0027s the end of one of the longest and most extraordinary reigns by any manager of any football club.          Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to beIt\u0027s a bitter-sweet moment, even for people like me who\u0027ve been demanding it happen for nearly a decade.Before the comparative misery of recent years – just three (devalued) FA Cup wins in 14 years is not a return \u0027big club\u0027 fans paying the highest ticket prices in Europe should reasonably accept - Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans.We won the Double in his first season 19978, and again in 2002.Then in 2004, we became the first – and to date ONLY – team to go through an entire English league season unbeaten.The \u0027Invincibles\u0027 as they became known were a dazzling side, bursting with incredible talent like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, and a ferocious fighting spirit led by captain Patrick Vieira that cowed many opponents into submission before the game even started.When we won the League that season, at the home of our bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, I was a guest of Lord Sugar\u0027s in the Spurs boardroom.Understandably, it had emptied long before Arsenal\u0027s players stopped celebrating out on the pitch.(Sugar was half way back to Chigwell before the final whistle, so desperate was he to avoid my inevitable gloating.)In fact, there was just me and my dad, ironically a lifelong Spurs fan, left when the door suddenly swung upon, and in walked Wenger and his long time No2, Pat Rice.I embraced them both like they were surgeons who\u0027d just saved my life – arguably, preposterously, this achievement felt even sweeter than that.Then I ordered the most expensive bottle of French red wine the boardroom stocked, at Lord Sugar\u0027s expense obviously, and the four of us sat alone together for an hour chatting about football.I met Wenger many times in those glorious early years and football was pretty much all he ever talked about.But he did it with such passion and knowledge.As anyone in the game will attest, Wenger\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with football.          Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans and he\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with footballHis idea of a great night is sitting at home watching a lower league Swedish reserve game on TV.For my part, that hour I spent in the Spurs boardroom with him remains one of the greatest experiences of my life.I can genuinely say I\u0027ve never loved any man more than I loved Arsène Wenger that day.By yesterday, 14 years on, that love had dissolved into a feeling of such despair I could barely look at the man.As Socrates said: \u0027The hottest love has the coldest end.\u0027And yet now, as I finally write Wenger\u0027s Arsenal obituary and remember the incredible highs I experienced under him in that first epic decade, those old feelings stir once more.Like any elongated orce, this has been a painful process for all Arsenal fans.Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to be.I particularly loathed seeing him showered with vicious personal abuse in the street from time to time by a few idiotic yobs.Contrary to popular belief, I have never hated Wenger the man I\u0027ve only hated his refusal to step down when it was obvious he should, especially when brilliant potential replacements like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola came on the market and were swooped up by Premier League rivals.But now, finally, he\u0027s done so and that allows me to pay tribute to Arsene Wenger, rather than incessantly moan about him.          Wenger pictured when he first arrived at Arsenal\u0027s then-home Highbury in 1996For eight years, he rivalled Sir Alex as the best manager in the world and based on that period alone, he was the best in Arsenal history.He\u0027s won 10 trophies in 22 years and over 1200 games.But his true legacy will be the way he transformed the way English football was played and how the players conducted themselves.Out went the beer, in came the scientific diets and fitness regimes.More importantly, Wenger drove his teams to play exhilarating one-touch, high-speed football of such exquisite skill and style that it made us the envy of the world.\u0027My never ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man,\u0027 he told L\u0027Équipe in 2016.That struggle grew harder in recent years as Wenger\u0027s powers lessened, but this is not the day to dwell on that.This is the day to look back with gratitude for the great times he gave us.Wenger\u0027s announcement hit the perfect note.\u0027I managed the club with full commitment and integrity,\u0027 he said, which is entirely true.Then he added: \u0027I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club. My love and support forever.\u0027          I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirementWhether you were Wenger Out, or Wenger In, that\u0027s a sentiment to bring a lump to the throat.I hope we now go on and win the Europa League for him.That would be the best way to send Wenger off.It won\u0027t be easy because our semi-final opponents are the very capable Atletico Madrid whose manager Diego Simeone is just the kind of youthful, ruthless, dynamic firebrand that Wenger used to be.But I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirement.The Emirates stadium will be packed for every one of the final few home games, and the roars of \u0027One Arsene Wenger\u0027 will once again be heard all over North London.That is no less than he deserves.It\u0027s time for Wenger\u0027s most ferocious critics like me to get off his back and say what we have wanted to say throughout these long, tortuous years campaigning for his exit: \u0027Goodbye, Arsene, and thank you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/4B5ABBEC00000578-5638857-image-a-26_1524233083082.jpg","title":"Owner mansion ordered chop huge trees neighbour complained kept shadows","story":"    Dr David Hamilton owns the property Isla Bank House in Keith, Moray, a 12-bedroomed property that was built around 1892 and boasts antique furnishings and extensive gardens          A prolonged row between Dr Hamilton and his neighbour Stacey Chalmers over a \u0027green wall\u0027 of western red cedar trees has seen council bosses order a large section of the 230ft long hedge be cut down Mrs Chalmers said efforts to reach an amicable settlement with her Norfolk-based neighbour had failed despite numerous attempts in the past three years.She claimed the shadow cast by the enormous trees opposite her home forced her to have her kitchen lights on all year round and starved her back garden of sunshine.She used high hedge laws in a bid to have Moray Council order to take action after claiming the attempts at negotiating an agreement had left her \u0027stressed and overwhelmed\u0027.A report issued by council planners following site visits resulted in victory for Mrs Chalmers and an order to chop the trees issued last month.Planners said: \u0027The hedge is currently between approx 45 and 52ft high and therefore results in a significant impact on the applicant\u0027s conservatory and kitchen windows and rear private garden space. Elephants on the rampage in north London: Incredible...My brand new £700,000 house stinks!

And now the great thistle invasion seemed to be proving them right.A biblical gust of wind!

Was this the end of our vision to establish a patch of self-wilded nature, a messy, rambunctious, mini-wilderness in the heart of West Sussex?Just when all seemed lost, out of a clear blue sky came a very different invasion. That warm, clear Sunday morning in May 2009, we woke to see painted lady butterflies streaming past our bedroom window at the rate of one a minute.Outside, thousands upon thousands of them had descended on the swathes of creeping thistle to lay their eggs. As we approached, our dogs ran into the prickly cover, sending up puffs of orange and brown wings like autumn leaves.          The rewilding of Knepp has turned out to be far richer than we ever dreamed and is producing a wealth of information new to science, often subverting what ecologists think they know about the natural world, says Isabella Tree (pictured)We walked for half an hour that morning, parting curtains of butterflies. A few weeks later, spiky black caterpillars were swarming over the thistles, spinning silken webs like tents.The whole area took on the appearance of a chaotic army encampment.By autumn, the caterpillars had wolfed down the leaves, pupated and flown away, leaving our thistle fields in tatters. The following year, our 60 acres of creeping thistle had vanished entirely.Not only had Nature solved the thistle problem, but thanks to sitting on our hands, we’d been given a ringside seat at one of its greatest spectacles.Knepp Castle Estate is just 45 miles from Central London, though you wouldn’t know it. Thorny scrub — hawthorn, blackthorn, dog rose and bramble — has punched through fields that, only a few years earlier, were blanketed with maize and barley.          Miles of hedgerows, previously cut back every autumn — thereby depriving birds of winter berries — have exploded into the welcoming earth, billowing out like a dowager liberated from her stays.The first thing that strikes visitors is the noise: the low-level surround-sound thrumming of insects. Then the countless different bird songs: the very air, it seems, is being recolonised with the sounds of the past.We walk knee-deep through ox-eye daisies, bird’s-foot trefoil, ragged robin, knapweed, red clover, lady’s bedstraw, crested dog’s tail and sweet vernal grass, kicking up grasshoppers, hoverflies and all sorts of bumblebees.On a good July day, I can count ten species of butterfly — we have 34 altogether, including the rare purple emperor — without moving from my desk. At night, Knepp hosts an incredible 441 different species of moth.Meanwhile, more and more endangered species turn up every year — such as turtle doves, which are on the brink of extinction, and nightingales, whose numbers fell by 91 per cent between 1967 and 2007.          It took about two years for our longhorns to settle into a recognisable pattern, with an older cow as decision-maker. The herd might be lazing in the sun or holed up in warm leaf litter when suddenly she’d begin to bellow and lead them off into a brisk trotCuckoos, spotted flycatchers, fieldfares, hobbies, woodlarks, skylarks, lapwings, house sparrows, lesser spotted woodpeckers, yellowhammers, woodcock, red kites, sparrowhawks, peregrine falcons, all five types of British owl, the first ravens at Knepp in the past 100 years — the list goes on and on.The speed at which all these species — and many more — have appeared has astonished observers, particularly as our intensively farmed land was, biologically speaking, in dire condition in 2001, at the start of the project.The key to Knepp’s extraordinary success? It’s about surrendering all preconceptions, and simply observing what happens.By contrast, conventional conservation tends to be about targets and control, and often involves micro-managing a habitat for the perceived benefit of several chosen species.Originally, Charlie and I had embarked on this project — funded chiefly by conservation grants — out of an amateurish love for wildlife. (We supplement our income by renting out redundant farm buildings, selling organic meat and organising wildlife safaris.)          Before: The speed at which all these species — and many more — have appeared has astonished observers, particularly as our intensively farmed land was, biologically speaking, in dire condition in 2001, at the start of the projectThe rewilding of Knepp has turned out to be far richer than we ever dreamed and is producing a wealth of information new to science, often subverting what ecologists think they know about the natural world.Leave a piece of land to nature for long enough, and it will eventually become a dense wood. Every farmer knows that.In ancient times, before humans had any impact on the land, Britain was covered with closed-canopy forest. A squirrel could have run from John o’ Groats to Land’s End across the tops of trees.Or so the prevailing theory goes. But it’s wrong for several reasons. One is that grazing animals — such as wild ox, horses and bison — were here long before the trees.And if they’d had to live in dense forests, they would have quickly died off. Another is that Britain has had oak trees for millennia, and these require an open landscape. Fossils of beetles and snails, among other species, also indicate that the land was once largely wood pasture (trees dotted across fields) and thorny scrub.          In ancient times, before humans had any impact on the land, Britain was covered with closed-canopy forest. A squirrel could have run from John o’ Groats to Land’s End across the tops of treesSo what stopped the trees from taking over? There’s only one possible answer: herbivores. Unfortunately, many of the big, grazing animals that once roamed Britain — such as the wild ox, the original wild horse and the truly wild boar — are now extinct. But we have modern equivalents and we decided to introduce some of these to Knepp: red and fallow deer, Exmoor ponies, Tamworth pigs and old English longhorns.We’d chosen the longhorns because they retain enough of their wild ancestor’s genes to survive all year round outside.But how would they really behave when they were allowed to run wild? In featureless fields, our old dairy herds had simply kept their heads down chewing the cud, but without fences to contain them the longhorns could give full expression to their innate desires and preferences.They weaved among the trees, rubbing themselves against trunks and low-lying branches, raising their heads to strip off leaves and buds with their long, gluey tongues, foraged in the margins of ponds and streams, waded through the marsh.          We’d chosen the longhorns because they retain enough of their wild ancestor’s genes to survive all year round outsideThey seemed to love the sallow trees: when the flies and midges were bothersome, they’d rub their horns against the branches, smearing sap on to their faces as insect repellent.At first, not intervening, particularly when the longhorns were calving, felt entirely alien. We’d find ourselves suddenly encountering newborns lying in a ditch or hedge.Shortly after the birth, the cow would often seek out a patch of nettles to eat, presumably to replenish her levels of iron. After suckling her newborn, the new mother returns to the herd, commuting sometimes miles to her fellows and back again until her calf is strong enough to follow her.The calf’s introduction to the herd is momentous. The cattle crowd around, lowing gently, sniffing at the new arrival one by one, imprinting its aroma.While the calves are still young, one or two experienced matrons often guard them in a nursery while the herd moves on to feed. But even after a cow has more offspring, the family bond remains strong.I thought back to the agonising nights, many years before, when I’d hear bellowing calves, newly separated from their mothers.At just three days old, they’d been put into calf units, where they were fed on powdered milk from an automated machine.It took about two years for our longhorns to settle into a recognisable pattern, with an older cow as decision-maker. The herd might be lazing in the sun or holed up in warm leaf litter when suddenly she’d begin to bellow and lead them off into a brisk trot.Seeing the cattle crashing along on some unknown mission is reminiscent of the elephant march in The Jungle Book.It was also soon clear that the longhorns were creating opportunities for other species.          I thought back to the agonising nights, many years before, when I’d hear bellowing calves, newly separated from their mothersIn places where a low branch provided a scratching post, for example, the clay compacted by their hooves created saucers that periodically filled with water.These clean-water ‘ephemeral ponds’ are an important habitat for plants like water crowfoot, water starwort and stoneworts, and a whole range of snails and water beetles, as well as the endangered and ethereal fairy shrimp.The first March after the longhorns’ arrival, their former owner paid us a visit, anxious to see how they’d weathered the winter without human intervention.He couldn’t believe we hadn’t fed them. Nor had there been any need for the vet indeed, our calving and health statistics were better than on most conventional cattle farms.Browsing on twigs, bark, herbs and leaves appears to provide cows with nutrients and minerals that grass alone cannot give.          These clean-water ‘ephemeral ponds’ are an important habitat for plants like water crowfoot, water starwort and stoneworts, and a whole range of snails and water beetles, as well as the endangered and ethereal fairy shrimpIn addition, many of these have medicinal properties — indeed, the hedges of old provided livestock with a source of nutrition and self-medication.Apart from all that, longhorns produce exceptional beef. The chef Heston Blumenthal rates it above all other types, including Japanese Kobe, as the best-tasting steak in the world.We started culling when our herd had expanded to 283 head — more than the land could happily sustain. Suddenly, a by-product of rewilding became a significant income stream. We were, in effect, producing premium organic beef with no feed and few other costs — and there are now waiting lists for our prime cuts.Six Exmoor ponies arrived months after the cattle, in 2003.As they galloped from the trailer, bucking their way back to freedom, we could see we were dealing with an animal way wilder than the longhorn.          A native species red deer, pictured, was introduced to the project in West SussexThere’s little doubt about their credentials as an ancient breed: fossil remains dating back to around 50,000BC have been found round Exmoor. Now an endangered species, they’re rarer than tigers.A year later, we introduced two Tamworth sows and their eight piglets. Prohibited by law from keeping wild boar, we’d opted for this old breed to stand in as their proxy — rootling and disturbing the soil as their ancestors had on our land in the time of King John.The Exmoors acted as if we’d introduced them to a pack of grizzly bears.One glimpse of the vast, bristly, ginger farmyard sows, and the ponies were running for the hills. Perhaps they had some atavistic memory of wild boar predating on newborn foals.The pigs had an extraordinary impact. The instant they were let out, they destroyed Charlie’s manicured verges along the drives with the unstoppable momentum of forklift trucks.Then, two abreast, they unzipped the turf down the public footpaths.          A year later, we introduced two Tamworth sows and their eight piglets. Prohibited by law from keeping wild boar, we’d opted for this old breed to stand in as their proxy — rootling and disturbing the soil as their ancestors had on our land in the time of King JohnWe realised they were zeroing in on slivers of the land never ploughed — margins rich in invertebrates and rhizomes.Their ingenuity often got the better of us when it came to public events in our park.Though we electric-fenced a showground for a summer Craft Fair, we didn’t think to fortify the pond on one side of it.The pigs swam over in the middle of the night, broke into the confectionery tent and hoovered down two sacks of Mr Whippy powdered ice cream.At first, we were dismayed to observe their capacity for damage, particularly in the wet, when ten pigs could churn acres into the battlefield of the Somme in a matter of hours. But the land’s ability to regenerate was equally astonishing.Within days, a patchwork of pioneer plants would appear where the sward had been opened. Invertebrates, including rare bees, colonised the exposed ground.          To many of our neighbours, the most offensive aspect of Knepp, epitomising our neglectful ways, is the appearance of ‘injurious’ weeds. By far the worst, in their view, is common ragwort. Standing around 3ft tall, it produces dense, flat-topped clusters of bright yellow flowers, and is thought to be a killer of livestockIn winter, wrens, dunnocks and robins trailed in the wake of the Tamworths, picking for insects in the furrows.Ants used clods of earth turned over by the pigs to kick-start anthills that have grown, in some places, over a foot in eight years.Anthills, in turn, attracted mistle thrushes and wheatears — and especially green woodpeckers, whose diet consists of as much as 80 per cent grassland ants.To many of our neighbours, the most offensive aspect of Knepp, epitomising our neglectful ways, is the appearance of ‘injurious’ weeds. By far the worst, in their view, is common ragwort. Standing around 3ft tall, it produces dense, flat-topped clusters of bright yellow flowers, and is thought to be a killer of livestock.And it does, indeed, contain toxins that, when eaten in large quantities, cause liver failure and death.But grazing animals have lived with it for tens of thousands of years.Our longhorns, Exmoors and Tamworths, as well as roe and red deer, graze among ragwort with no adverse effects.          Contrary to what naturalists had assumed, a nightingale is not a woodland bird after all. Neither are purple emperors — one of our most spectacular butterflies — a woodland species, as previously thought: ours nest in young sallow scrubThey know to avoid it. In fact, the plant itself warns them away with its bitter taste and unpleasant smell.Poisoning arises not in the wild, of course, but where fields and paddocks are over-grazed and the animals have no choice but to eat it — or when ragwort is cut into silage or hay and animals are unable to detect and avoid it.Even then, the animal has to eat an excessive amount for it to be fatal, yet few people nowadays are able to accept common ragwort’s place in nature.To put it in context, there are plenty of other common plants that can kill, including foxglove, cuckoo pint, ivy, black bryony, white bryony, bracken, elder, spindle, and yew — as well as daffodils, one of our most poisonous plants.A few years ago, daffodils almost killed a vicar, after he ate a bunch to enliven his Easter sermon. He had to be rushed to hospital to have his stomach pumped. Yet no one thinks to denigrate these lovely flowers.As for ragwort, it’s one of the most sustaining hosts to insects that we have in Britain: in all, 177 species of insects use it as a source of nectar or pollen.The nightingales arrived in such numbers that we began to have nightingale dinners, taking friends out at night to listen to their astonishing arias. Most had never heard one before.Conservationists began taking an interest when it emerged that the nightingales nested deep in the exploding skirts of an overgrown hedge, fringed with brambles, nettles and long grasses.Contrary to what naturalists had assumed, a nightingale is not a woodland bird after all. Neither are purple emperors — one of our most spectacular butterflies — a woodland species, as previously thought: ours nest in young sallow scrub.Even more exciting even than the nightingales was the arrival of turtle doves, with their throaty turr-turr-ing.There are estimated to be fewer than 5,000 pairs left in the whole of Britain. The RSPB describes them as feeding on seeds and nothing else. In fact, in the increasing absence of weeds in the countryside, grains may be their food of last resort.          Cuckoos, spotted flycatchers, fieldfares, hobbies, woodlarks, skylarks, lapwings, house sparrows, lesser spotted woodpeckers, yellowhammers, woodcock, red kites, sparrowhawks, peregrine falcons, all five types of British owl, the first ravens at Knepp in the past 100 years — the list goes on and onWhole grains are indigestible and the sharp edges of cracked grains can tear their throats. Grains can also absorb moisture in the gut and generate fungal disease.We don’t yet know exactly what our turtle doves are eating, but we do know that they’re finding it at Knepp.The pigs may yet again be playing a role: their rootling produces exactly the right conditions for the germination of seed-bearing wildflowers that attract these rare birds.One thing is for certain. If we hadn’t allowed a dynamic ecosystem to establish itself here, we’d never have had turtle doves — or any other endangered species — in the first place.And if all these natural miracles can happen here, on our depleted patch of land in the over-developed, densely populated South-East, they can happen anywhere.Adapted from Wilding: The Return Of Nature To A British Farm by Isabella Tree, published by Picador on May 3 at £20.

He did so only after much soul-searching and believes that if he hadn’t let go of his hatred, ‘I wouldn’t be here talking to you now’.Neville has long been regarded as a man of few words, but with forgiveness has come liberation. Today, the feelings he had kept locked deep inside for so many years come tumbling out.This is the first time he has spoken with such raw honesty about his personal struggles.‘I was so angry — even in my sleep, I’d be thinking bad thoughts. Gradually, I’ve let those thoughts go. I’ve got to the stage now where I don’t even remember the names of the guys who killed him. They used to be here.’ He taps his forehead. ‘Slowly, the anger is going away.’          Earlier this week, Neville Lawrence made a pilgrimage of sorts to the bus stop where his 18-year-old son, Stephen, was fatally stabbed 25 years agoToday, Neville, 76, looks a decade younger than the beleaguered man who stood on the Old Bailey steps when two of his son’s murderers, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, were sentenced to life imprisonment six years ago.Those convictions, the first since Stephen’s death, might well have been a victory for justice, but they didn’t ease Neville’s suffering. Nor the suffering of Stephen’s mother, Baroness Lawrence, who, in an emotional interview with this newspaper earlier this month, confessed she hasn’t known true happiness since her son’s death, and spoke of her desire to ‘draw a line’ under her tireless campaigning for Stephen.She also urged police, in the absence of significant leads, to close the investigation.Neville disagrees. ‘After the verdict, I went to my son’s grave in Jamaica. I know a lot of people would say you’re mad talking to somebody who’s dead, but I talk to him. I said: “We’ve got two of them, I don’t know if we’re going to get any more, but we have that satisfaction for the time being.” ’He falls silent and, for a moment, he is thousands of miles away, at the peaceful plot in Jamaica where his son lies buried in the shade of coconut and ackee trees. ‘Knowing my son’s lying there in the ground, sometimes I just go to pieces.‘Even now when I start talking about it, my eyes fill up because I know what kind of person he was — what kind of person he would have been.  For many years, Neville could not even bring himself to drive along the road in South-East London where his desperately wounded son ran for some 350 yards before he fell‘We had some justice, but I’m still hoping for total justice, which is why I don’t want them to close the case. I want them to scale the investigation down, but not close it.‘With all the publicity there is at the moment, someone might decide to come forward and say something they haven’t before.’This week, Stephen’s death has dominated the media.To mark the 25th anniversary, a gripping three-part BBC documentary, Stephen: The Murder That Changed A Nation, examined in forensic detail the senseless murder and the fight for justice, passionately championed by the Daily Mail, which led to the exposure of institutional racism running deep in the Metropolitan Police. The repercussions continue to reverberate throughout every level of society to this day.On Monday, leading dignitaries, including Prince Harry and Prime Minister Theresa May, will gather at a memorial service in London, organised by Baroness Lawrence, to remember Stephen and celebrate all that has been achieved in his name.Until three days ago, Neville thought he wouldn’t be there. He had not been invited, until Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick intervened. Neville does not dwell upon the reasons why he wasn’t on the guest list. He simply says: ‘I wanted to go. It’s my son, but I wasn’t the one arranging it, so what could I do?‘On Wednesday evening, the police commissioner phoned. She said she hadn’t seen an invitation for me, so now I’m going.’The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. In her interview with the Mail two weeks ago, Stephen’s mother said: ‘Neville and I were two different people after that night. They say a tragedy like that either pushes you together or pulls you apart. The latter is exactly what happened.    The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. Pictured: Doreen and Neville Lawrence at the first murder trial ‘In a way, I felt she was blaming me for Stephen’s death. Whether that was right or wrong, I don’t know, but that’s what I was feeling inside.‘Doreen was away on a field trip for her degree when Stephen was murdered. I was supposed to be looking after the children. If something happens to your child when one of you is away, straight away you start thinking: “If I’d been here, maybe it wouldn’t have happened.”‘She hasn’t said she blames me, but I think she does. I know I was blaming myself.’Neville, a talented plasterer and decorator, had been looking after the children for two days when Stephen left for school that day. By nature a warm, jovial man, his spirits had been worn down by a lack of work during the recession.The marriage was, he concedes, going through a difficult patch, but he believed the overriding love they had for their children would help them to weather it.‘I thought I wouldn’t have any children because it took so long to find someone I wanted to marry,’ says Neville. ‘I’d made this promise to myself I would not have a child out of wedlock. I wanted to be married to somebody, so my children could grow up in my house and I could have influence over them.‘Stephen was my first-born child. I was there when he arrived. When he came out of hospital, I was worried all night because there were a lot of cot deaths about at the time. I kept getting up to listen to him breathing.’          A memorial plaque now marks the place with the words: ‘In memory of Stephen Lawrence 13.9.1974 to 22.4.1993. May he Rest in Peace\u0027Neville was a hands-on father who changed nappies and fed his son. He still has the first pair of baby shoes Stephen wore. ‘When he left that day, I was sitting at the window feeling really low about the fact I wasn’t working to support my family.‘He said: “Dad, are you OK?” I said: “Yes I’m fine.” He said: “Are you sure?” I said: “Yes, and remember your mummy’s coming back tonight. I’m going to do dinner, so come straight home from school.” ’But Stephen didn’t come home.Instead, two neighbours knocked on the door to tell Doreen, by now home, and Neville, that Stephen had been attacked. They called police stations and searched the streets. Finding no sign of their son, they went to a nearby hospital and learned he had been admitted.‘When we got to the hospital, I asked where Stephen was. The doctor said: “We’re working on him.” They showed us to a waiting room. When I saw a nurse and doctor walking down the corridor, I’m thinking: “Please, God, let them tell me he’s going to be OK.” They told us he was dead.‘After touching my son on that hospital slab, I can remember nothing else.’Neville’s next memory is waking up the following morning. He thought his son’s death was a bad dream.‘The first thing I did was go to Stephen’s bedroom to see if his bed had been slept in. When I saw it hadn’t, I knew that what I’d remembered was true.‘For a few days, I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t even remember my full name. I was walking around kind of stunted in a way.‘It affected me so much. I was never the Neville who was here before Stephen was murdered. I was different.’          Luke Knight, 41, showed little remorse when confronted ahead of the 25th anniversaryBefore a reporter could question him, the roofer, wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt, shouted: ‘Oh, f*** off, mate,’ before slamming his door.His outburst came after the BBC broadcast the first of its three-part series on Britain’s most notorious race murder. Earlier, Knight had his trademark swagger as he walked down the street near where he and his cohorts once terrorised locals.In February 1997, the Mail accused Knight’s gang of murdering 18-year-old Stephen in a savage, unprovoked attack as he waited with a friend at a bus-stop on April 22, 1993.Two of the gang, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, are serving life for the killing, after a forensic breakthrough led to a second murder trial six years ago. A third, Neil Acourt, 42, is in jail for masterminding a £4 million cannabis ring.

Sense of history preferred. No salary.Sound familiar?Little wonder that the clunkingly obvious person for the job was formally endorsed as the next Head of the Commonwealth yesterday.It had been the Queen’s ‘sincere wish’ that the Prince of Wales should be acknowledged as her chosen successor to this non-hereditary role.So last night’s news, confirmed in the leaders’ statement at the close of the Commonwealth summit, will have come as an early present ahead of today’s celebrations for the Queen’s 92nd birthday.Yesterday, she was doing what she has enjoyed doing for the best part of seven decades as she surrounded herself with the leaders of the 53 Commonwealth nations. She invited them for drinks during their informal ‘retreat’ – the traditional finale of these summits – at Windsor Castle.She stayed well away from all the networking going on in the state apartments, where the politicians were berthed. Later, they were invited to her side of the castle for refreshments. The Prince of Wales, quite properly, was miles away.He will no doubt be pleased that this delicate succession issue has been resolved now, at a time of the Queen’s choosing rather than the Almighty’s.          The Prince of Wales greets the Sultan of Brunei Hassanal Bolkiah in a receiving line for the Queen\u0027s Dinner for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting          Anita Sethi (right of photo, with glasses on her head) meeting Prince Charles at the Commonwealth People\u0027s Forum in LondonThere has been no change to the process, however, and the Royal Family have not sought one. They understand that the headship must be earned, and not simply inherited. The Duke of Cambridge is well aware of that.The only grudging footnote to Charles’s appointment as head-in-waiting was a bizarre claim in yesterday’s Guardian. A writer called Anita Sethi has written that she met the prince at this week’s Commonwealth People’s Forum.Ooops! The new Head of Commonwealth-elect Prince Charles...When can you start? Prince Charles to begin new role as Head...Share this articleAccording to her account, he deployed that trusty conversation-starter ‘And where are you from?’ – to which she replied: ‘Manchester’.She then says the prince joked: ‘Well, you don’t look like it!’ As a result, Miss Sethi, who is of Guyanese heritage, now argues that the prince is unfit to lead the Commonwealth.          Ms Sethi says Prince Charles told her \u0027you don\u0027t look like you\u0027re from Manchester\u0027             She then says the prince joked: ‘Well, you don’t look like it!’            I am intrigued by this exchange for many reasons – not least the fact that I, too, happened to be at this event. I certainly can’t claim to have heard everything the prince said, but I heard a fair bit and I didn’t hear him say this.The occasion, frankly, was a bunfight because so many people were jostling to meet him. He was doing the rounds of a London conference centre where thousands of delegates were attending four different forums.When he walked in to a buffet lunch for the Business Forum delegates, a band of drummers made so much noise that it was impossible to hear the prince say anything. It wasn’t very different two floors up at the People’s Forum where Miss Sethi was in the melee.The scrum got so bad that one veteran royal photographer simply gave up trying to take a picture and helped himself to a plate of curry. The organisers had tried to line up pre-arranged groups for royal introductions, but it turned in to a free-for-all.          Ms Sethi says she was \u0027stunned\u0027 by the prince\u0027s gaffe and she could \u0027show him her passport to prove where she was born\u0027In the midst of this good-natured shambles, Miss Sethi tried to draw the prince’s attention to her latest book – it was then the alleged exchange took place. Clarence House has opted for dignified silence. I can only say that the Sethi version of events bears no relation to the man I have seen in these situations over more than 25 years. The prince has always seen it as his role to act as a bridge between races and cultures, and has done so for longer than perhaps any politician or ‘community leader’ in Britain.Take his thoughts on the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants. ‘Thank you for coming and for your contributions to this country,’ he said to hundreds of families at a special Windrush party he organised at St James’s Palace.          Prince Charles greets Canadian Prime Minister Justin TrudeauThis wasn’t the other day. It happened in 1998, two decades before those buffoons at the Home Office learned about the legacy of the Windrush.That same year, I followed him on tours of Sri Lanka and Nepal where he met thousands of people just like those he has been doing this week. No gaffes.Two years later, I followed him to the Caribbean. We ended up in Guyana, the country where members of Miss Sethi’s family were once indentured workers. There were many engagements in run-down areas of the capital, Georgetown. The prince met the most deprived members of society and went to see a local version of his Youth Business Trust. No gaffes. Ditto in South Africa, Lesotho, Jamaica, Malaysia, Singapore and Trinidad – all Commonwealth countries where I have been glued to the poor man’s every move.So is Charles, as he nears his 70th birthday, suddenly starting to lose the plot? I don’t think so. Having toured the Commonwealth since the age of five, he is manifestly suited to step in to the Queen’s oceanic Commonwealth shoes when the time comes. He must be the only person (except the Queen) who can identify all of the flags fluttering along the Mall this week.This is an organisation which cannot open its mouth without banging on about the fact that 60 per cent of its people are under 30. And guess who established the biggest youth charity network in Britain? This week, the Prince’s Trust International, its global arm, was round for tea at Clarence House.In fact, what is perhaps most striking about his appointment is the lack of controversy.

W. Bush sits by Barbara\u0027s...Avicii dead at 28: Wake Me Up DJ Tim Bergling dies in Oman...Share this articleKAYAKS MADE FROM FISHING NETSIn January this year, the first kayak made from recycled fishing nets came off the production line.It was created by amateur er Rob Thompson, who was desperate to find a use for all the abandoned nets, crab pots and fisherman’s rope he came across while exploring underwater.An estimated 600,000 tons of damaged or dumped plastic netting has built up in the oceans, where it traps and strangles sea life.He dreamed up a plan to turn the nets into kayaks, which beach-cleaning crews could then use to access remote stretches of coastline — and clear them of even more toxic plastic trash.He tracked down a recycling plant in Denmark that would accept old nets and convert them into recycled plastic pellets.Then, working with a kayak company called Palm Equipment, based near Bristol, he found a way to turn the pellets made from nets into a kayak by mixing the pellets with recylced marine plastic collected from beach clear-ups.Now Rob has teamed up with Keep Britain Tidy, organising volunteer ers and beach-cleaning groups from around the UK to gather fishing nets and ship them off to Denmark in bulk, rather than seeing them dumped in landfill.‘The first batch has produced 150kg of recycled plastic pellets, which is enough for six kayaks,’ says Rob.The prototypes are being used by beach clean-up volunteers, but the next batch will be sold (for around £370 each) and the proceeds will help rid Britain’s waters of yet more plastic (fathomsfree.org).SHAMPOO BOTTLES FROM BEACH WASTEThe sight of plastic food and drink packaging littering British beaches is a sickening reminder of the work that still needs to be done.But volunteer beach clean-up crews — many of whom will be taking part in our Great Plastic Pick Up weekend — have the option to put plastic that has been dumped or washed up on beaches into special bins funded by Procter \u0026amp Gamble.The company will then use this ‘ocean plastic’ — traditionally considered very difficult to recycle, as it is often degraded after spending time in the water — into new bottles of Head \u0026amp Shoulders shampoo and Fairy Liquid.  There’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid OceanThere’s 25 per cent recycled beach plastic in each bottle of Head \u0026amp Shoulders Beach, and 10 per cent in Fairy Liquid Ocean. The rest of the bottle is made of other recycled plastics.The process has been made possible by recycling company TerraCycle, which provides the bins and sorts the plastic. Its spokesman Stephen Clarke says: ‘Plastic coming from the marine environment is notoriously difficult to re-use, but we have found a technically revolutionary way of integrating 25 per cent of this plastic into the product.’DECKING FROM MILK BOTTLE TOPSImagine being able to wander into your garden to enjoy a morning coffee on your stylish decking, confident that it hasn’t started to rot over the winter, there’s no mildew to scrub off and no splinters — plus the satisfaction of knowing it’s also great for the environment.In recent years, the single biggest use of low-grade recycled plastic in the UK (such as bottle tops, yoghurt pots and bleach bottles) has been the manufacture of ‘plastic wood’ — plastic planks moulded to look like wood which are then used to build outdoor furniture and play equipment.The problem is most types look much more like unsightly plastic than timber.  Composite Prime has melted down recycled plastic and mixed it with unwanted off-cuts of hardwood, ground down to a fine flour, to create durable, low-maintenance decking which looks just like the real thingBut a company called Composite Prime has melted down recycled plastic and mixed it with unwanted off-cuts of hardwood, ground down to a fine flour, to create durable, low-maintenance decking which looks just like the real thing.Each plank has roughly 35 per cent plastic from discarded milk bottles and their tops.‘We saved over 9.5million milk bottles from landfill last year,’ says Charles Taylor, a director of the company.A KITCHEN FROM COLA BOTTLES . . .That plastic bottle you toss into the recycling bin could one day return as part of your kitchen cabinet door.Ikea’s new Kungsbacka range of kitchen fronts is made from recycled wood coated in a thin plastic foil made from recycled bottles, with 25 half-litre bottles used for each door.Darryl Pirie, of Ikea kitchens, says: ‘The range turns everyday waste into beautiful furniture.’Ikea also makes storage boxes (£3 to £12) from recycled plastic bottles, spray bottles (80p) from waste plastic collected from the store and its distribution centres, and a desk pad (£4.50) made with 50 per cent recycled plastic from Ikea packaging.. . . AND A MATTRESSYou could soon be dozing off on a soft mattress made from plastic bottles collected during the Great Plastic Pick Up. Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattresses (£489 for a double, silentnight.co.uk).The mattress, launched last year, is made from plastic bottles that are crushed and spun into a fine, soft fibre. This is then used to form a special breathable layer that makes sleeping on it a cooler, more comfortable experience.In one year alone, Silentnight claims to have prevented 105 million plastic bottles from entering landfill or the sea.          Silentnight uses 150 recycled plastic bottles in each of its Eco Comfort Pocket mattressesROADS MADE OF PLASTIC PELLETSYou could be driving to work over a recycled plastic road.Toby McCartney, founder of road surfacing company MacRebur, came up with the idea after a trip to India. He saw locals collect waste plastic from rubbish dumps, pile it up over potholes in the road, pour petrol over it and set it alight. ‘I watched with fascination as the melted plastic moulded to fit the shape of the hole, effectively filling it for free,’ he says.Now Toby takes plastic waste from local authority recycling plants across the country — ‘It’s the waste plastic no one really wants and which would normally be incinerated or go to landfill,’ he says — then melts it into pellets, which are added to an ordinary road surface mix to supplement the bitumen.‘Our roads are up to 60 per cent stronger and ten times longer lasting — and they don’t pothole,’ he says proudly.COFFEE CUPS FROM . . . COFFEE CUPS!They might look like they’re made from paper, but most takeaway coffee cups are lined with a thin layer of plastic. It stops your coffee from leaking out, but also makes them notoriously difficult to recycle.Now a UK company called ashortwalk, based in Cornwall, has designed the rCup, made from discarded coffee cups.Managing director Dan Dicker explains that the company gathers takeaway cups from outlets such as McDonald’s and Costa. They are then washed, shredded, and mixed 5050 with recycled plastic from coffee cup lids and straws.The rCup is leakproof, insulated, lasts ten years and is fully recyclable (£12 from www.rcup.co.uk, Waitrose and John Lewis).

The rest of the shoe is made from recycled polyester.Marine waste is also used in the laces, heel webbing, heel lining and sock liner covers, adding up to the equivalent of 11 plastic bottles per pair.The Adidas x Parley sports shoes range starts at £69.95.          Marine waste is also used in the laces, heel webbing, heel lining and sock liner covers, adding up to the equivalent of 11 plastic bottles per pair.NEW JUMPERS FROM RAGSOutdoor clothing brand Patagonia was creating fleeces from plastic bottles as far back as 1993.Today it turns plastic bottles, difficult-to-recycle manufacturing waste and worn-out garments into thin polyester fibers, which are then used to produce clothing such as the Snap-T fleece pullover (from £80, eu.patagonia.com) which is made from 85 per cent recycled polyester.‘By recycling old products, we can keep many of the same materials in circulation for years instead of creating new plastic,’ says a spokesperson.SHADES FROM TRAWLER WASTE In 2013, a group of U.S. surfers and environmentalists formed a firm called Bureo to help fishermen in Chile discard their old fishing nets responsibly rather than dumping them at sea.The nets are recycled to create decks for skateboards (around £200, carverskateboards.co.uk) and the frames for high-fashion sunglasses.  The Mail\u0027s great plastic pick up  The Mail is stepping up its war on plastic with The Great Plastic Pick Up — a weekend helping communities, schools, families and iniduals come together to clear plastic litter from our beaches, beauty spots and streets, in partnership with Keep Britain Tidy.A staggering 7,330 people have already signed up, and there are 315 Pick Ups being held countrywide.It’s so simple to join in and you can win amazing prizes that may make all the difference to your community.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in (right, on April 18) will hold a summit with Kim in a border truce village on April 27          Pyongyang toned down its rhetoric after Kim announced in his New Year\u0027s address his plan to improve relations with Seoul and send a delegation to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February. Images of these North Korean cheerleaders during the Olympics were seen around the worldMoon said the North was only seeking an end to \u0027hostile policies\u0027 against it and a guarantee of security in return.\u0027I don\u0027t think denuclearization has different meanings for South and North Korea,\u0027 he said. \u0027The North is expressing a will for a complete denuclearization.\u0027All they are talking about is the end of hostile policies against North Korea, followed by a guarantee of security.\u0027 The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.North Korea has said over the years that it could consider giving up its nuclear arsenal if the United States removed its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.          On Thursday, President Trump told a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that his campaign of \u0027maximum pressure\u0027 on North Korea would continue until Pyongyang gave up its nuclear weaponsIn a further development on Wednesday, Seoul said it hopes to use the up-coming summit  to change a decades-old armistice with North Korea into a peace agreement. China, Kim\u0027s main ally, immediately announced it backed the move.Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.Moon said he saw the possibility of a peace agreement, or even international aid for the North\u0027s economy, if it denuclearizes.But he also said the inter-Korean summit had \u0027a lot of constraints\u0027, in that the two Koreas could not make progress separate from the North Korea-United States summit, and could not reach an agreement that transcends international sanctions.\u0027So first, the South-North Korean summit must make a good beginning, and the dialogue between the two Koreas likely must continue after we see the results of the North Korea-United States summit,\u0027 Moon said.  South Korean army soldiers pass by a wire fence decorated with ribbons written with messages wishing for the reunification of the two Koreas at the Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, South Korea, on April 20.

The film studio filed for bankruptcy in March amid the scandal.Weinstein is the target of federal and state criminal investigations in at least four different jurisdictions, including New York, Los Angeles, and London, which have requested documentation relating to their cases, according to the filing.He is also the subject of at least 11 civil suits, including one brought by British aspiring actress Kadian Noble.

Cousins: \u0027It is critical that Mr. Weinstein be granted access to e-mails relevant to the certain civil proceedings and criminal investigations and that are in the Debtors\u0027 possession, as they were sent or received by his TWC e-mail accounts.

A second guy was smashing another vehicle, which was also an A-class Mercedes like mine.\u0027I came flying out wearing a pair of pyjama shorts and a summer jumper and one of them ran round the car and just came straight at me, which was the reason I managed to stop him.\u0027I used to play a lot of rugby, so I hit him with a shoulder and then I punched him a couple of times. I broke the visor clean off his helmet, which was one of those half-helmets with no jaw protector.\u0027He swung a quick sequence of frenetic punches, clearly shocked by my intervention. We exchanged a few blows, but the idea was simply to stop him. I didn\u0027t want to give him a kicking, but we did exchange blows.\u0027A second masked moped rider then stormed over to help his accomplice.He added: \u0027He grabbed my jumper and began to lay into me. I was fending one off and hitting the other one. Then I think it dawned on them. They thought, sh**, I\u0027ve just run into someone I don\u0027t want to be running into.\u0027Seeing he was outmatched, the second man got back onto his moped and raced away, leaving his partner facing Mr Canny alone.\u0027Not a lot was going through my mind,\u0027 he recalled. \u0027My only thought was, those absolute f****** b*******, breaking into my car. The second guy\u0027s hands were in back of my car.\u0027 Of the remaining suspect, he said: \u0027He was strong for small guy and from the look in his eyes I could tell he was off his head on something. He smelled strongly of marijuana.\u0027He was just lashing out at me and trying to push me against the wall. We started grappling and I tried to sweep him.\u0027It didn\u0027t work, but then I managed to get behind him and fold his body in two. I knew that he would eventually run out of steam.\u0027It was the sheer weight advantage allowed me to overpower him and stop him from getting away.\u0027We heard sirens. At that point he panicked, and for a good minute-and-a-half he was really kicking off to get away.\u0027Then he started apologising and offering to pay me and pay for the damage to the car.\u0027I told him to calm down and said I wasn\u0027t going to hurt him, but he had to stay here until the police came to take him away. I told him to stop fighting me, as I didn\u0027t want to have to hit him back.\u0027By this time, the man was sweating heavily and his helmet had entirely come off. He was struggling to breathe, and pulled down the balaclava he was wearing underneath the helmet to catch his breath.\u0027That was when he started to threaten me,\u0027 Mr Canny said. \u0027He said that he knew where I lived and that he would come back. I didn\u0027t take very kindly to that.\u0027I said you\u0027re not coming back anywhere mate, you do not threaten me like that. And we exchanged a couple more punches.\u0027Mr Canny admitted that he put himself at risk. \u0027If he\u0027d have pulled a knife, I\u0027d be in a lot of trouble,\u0027 he said.\u0027When I went out there I didn\u0027t know what I\u0027d find. There\u0027s huge risk involved in putting yourself in that situation.\u0027He added: \u0027I don\u0027t feel like a hero. I\u0027m just a person in the right place at the right time – or the wrong place at the wrong time, depending on how you view it.\u0027\u0027The police were extremely thankful. They said thanks to you catching him in the act, we have potentially solved 10 crimes by catching this guy. \u0027I had no time to think, I just acted. But it was great that the police thanked me and didn\u0027t give me a moment of bother.\u0027                                                      "},{"url":null,"title":"Bored construction worker adds twist classic arcade game using workers heads","story":"    Near miss: One of the workers narrowly avoids a direct strike to the head.

He has since grown tired of his team\u0027s poor performances and has been calling for him to goThis season has been even worse than that.We\u0027re currently 6th in the League, out of both domestic competitions, and all that\u0027s left to play for is the Europa League, the ugly sister to the Cinderella-style Champions League that no big club wants to play in.As performances on the field have fallen, so has the size of the crowds.The Emirates stadium, supposedly our bold new platform to the elite of world football, has resembled a half-empty graveyard at times during recent games.Yet still Wenger\u0027s excuses have kept coming there\u0027s always a reason for our persistent failure in big competition, which has nothing to do with him.In the end, there is one statistic that says it all: Sir Alex Ferguson has won the Premier League five times since Wenger last won it, and he\u0027s been retired for five years.It\u0027s been so sad to see the slow, inexorable demise of our once great titan.          Some Arsenal fans have long waged a campaign calling for Wenger to be sackedArsenal legend Ian Wright put it well recently: \u0027Watching Wenger now is like witnessing the ageing Muhammad Ali against Larry Holmes or Brazil\u0027s Ronaldo when he got fat. The problem with Arsène is there is no one in his corner prepared to throw in the towel.\u0027Well, now he\u0027s done it himself.Or perhaps he was urged to throw it by board members at Arsenal? I know at least one who told me a few months ago he was hoping to persuade Wenger to finally see the writing on the wall.It doesn\u0027t really matter.Wenger\u0027s going and it\u0027s the end of one of the longest and most extraordinary reigns by any manager of any football club.          Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to beIt\u0027s a bitter-sweet moment, even for people like me who\u0027ve been demanding it happen for nearly a decade.Before the comparative misery of recent years – just three (devalued) FA Cup wins in 14 years is not a return \u0027big club\u0027 fans paying the highest ticket prices in Europe should reasonably accept - Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans.We won the Double in his first season 19978, and again in 2002.Then in 2004, we became the first – and to date ONLY – team to go through an entire English league season unbeaten.The \u0027Invincibles\u0027 as they became known were a dazzling side, bursting with incredible talent like Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp and Robert Pires, and a ferocious fighting spirit led by captain Patrick Vieira that cowed many opponents into submission before the game even started.When we won the League that season, at the home of our bitter North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, I was a guest of Lord Sugar\u0027s in the Spurs boardroom.Understandably, it had emptied long before Arsenal\u0027s players stopped celebrating out on the pitch.(Sugar was half way back to Chigwell before the final whistle, so desperate was he to avoid my inevitable gloating.)In fact, there was just me and my dad, ironically a lifelong Spurs fan, left when the door suddenly swung upon, and in walked Wenger and his long time No2, Pat Rice.I embraced them both like they were surgeons who\u0027d just saved my life – arguably, preposterously, this achievement felt even sweeter than that.Then I ordered the most expensive bottle of French red wine the boardroom stocked, at Lord Sugar\u0027s expense obviously, and the four of us sat alone together for an hour chatting about football.I met Wenger many times in those glorious early years and football was pretty much all he ever talked about.But he did it with such passion and knowledge.As anyone in the game will attest, Wenger\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with football.          Wenger was a God to all Arsenal fans and he\u0027s an erudite, well-read and charismatic man who is totally obsessed with footballHis idea of a great night is sitting at home watching a lower league Swedish reserve game on TV.For my part, that hour I spent in the Spurs boardroom with him remains one of the greatest experiences of my life.I can genuinely say I\u0027ve never loved any man more than I loved Arsène Wenger that day.By yesterday, 14 years on, that love had dissolved into a feeling of such despair I could barely look at the man.As Socrates said: \u0027The hottest love has the coldest end.\u0027And yet now, as I finally write Wenger\u0027s Arsenal obituary and remember the incredible highs I experienced under him in that first epic decade, those old feelings stir once more.Like any elongated orce, this has been a painful process for all Arsenal fans.Nobody, least of all me, has enjoyed seeing him reduced to a pale shadow of the manager he used to be.I particularly loathed seeing him showered with vicious personal abuse in the street from time to time by a few idiotic yobs.Contrary to popular belief, I have never hated Wenger the man I\u0027ve only hated his refusal to step down when it was obvious he should, especially when brilliant potential replacements like Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola came on the market and were swooped up by Premier League rivals.But now, finally, he\u0027s done so and that allows me to pay tribute to Arsene Wenger, rather than incessantly moan about him.          Wenger pictured when he first arrived at Arsenal\u0027s then-home Highbury in 1996For eight years, he rivalled Sir Alex as the best manager in the world and based on that period alone, he was the best in Arsenal history.He\u0027s won 10 trophies in 22 years and over 1200 games.But his true legacy will be the way he transformed the way English football was played and how the players conducted themselves.Out went the beer, in came the scientific diets and fitness regimes.More importantly, Wenger drove his teams to play exhilarating one-touch, high-speed football of such exquisite skill and style that it made us the envy of the world.\u0027My never ending struggle in this business is to release what is beautiful in man,\u0027 he told L\u0027Équipe in 2016.That struggle grew harder in recent years as Wenger\u0027s powers lessened, but this is not the day to dwell on that.This is the day to look back with gratitude for the great times he gave us.Wenger\u0027s announcement hit the perfect note.\u0027I managed the club with full commitment and integrity,\u0027 he said, which is entirely true.Then he added: \u0027I urge our fans to stand behind the team to finish on a high. To all the Arsenal lovers, take care of the values of the club. My love and support forever.\u0027          I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirementWhether you were Wenger Out, or Wenger In, that\u0027s a sentiment to bring a lump to the throat.I hope we now go on and win the Europa League for him.That would be the best way to send Wenger off.It won\u0027t be easy because our semi-final opponents are the very capable Atletico Madrid whose manager Diego Simeone is just the kind of youthful, ruthless, dynamic firebrand that Wenger used to be.But I have no doubt Arsenal fans, for so long bitterly fractured by contrary views of Wenger, will now rally as one to salute him into his Arsenal retirement.The Emirates stadium will be packed for every one of the final few home games, and the roars of \u0027One Arsene Wenger\u0027 will once again be heard all over North London.That is no less than he deserves.It\u0027s time for Wenger\u0027s most ferocious critics like me to get off his back and say what we have wanted to say throughout these long, tortuous years campaigning for his exit: \u0027Goodbye, Arsene, and thank you.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/20/15/4B5ABBEC00000578-5638857-image-a-26_1524233083082.jpg","title":"Owner mansion ordered chop huge trees neighbour complained kept shadows","story":"    Dr David Hamilton owns the property Isla Bank House in Keith, Moray, a 12-bedroomed property that was built around 1892 and boasts antique furnishings and extensive gardens          A prolonged row between Dr Hamilton and his neighbour Stacey Chalmers over a \u0027green wall\u0027 of western red cedar trees has seen council bosses order a large section of the 230ft long hedge be cut down Mrs Chalmers said efforts to reach an amicable settlement with her Norfolk-based neighbour had failed despite numerous attempts in the past three years.She claimed the shadow cast by the enormous trees opposite her home forced her to have her kitchen lights on all year round and starved her back garden of sunshine.She used high hedge laws in a bid to have Moray Council order to take action after claiming the attempts at negotiating an agreement had left her \u0027stressed and overwhelmed\u0027.A report issued by council planners following site visits resulted in victory for Mrs Chalmers and an order to chop the trees issued last month.Planners said: \u0027The hedge is currently between approx 45 and 52ft high and therefore results in a significant impact on the applicant\u0027s conservatory and kitchen windows and rear private garden space. Elephants on the rampage in north London: Incredible...My brand new £700,000 house stinks!

I was expecting to be able to walk down the street and say: “That’s a building my son made.”‘Instead, my son has become famous — in a sense, like a legend — for being killed.

He did so only after much soul-searching and believes that if he hadn’t let go of his hatred, ‘I wouldn’t be here talking to you now’.Neville has long been regarded as a man of few words, but with forgiveness has come liberation. Today, the feelings he had kept locked deep inside for so many years come tumbling out.This is the first time he has spoken with such raw honesty about his personal struggles.‘I was so angry — even in my sleep, I’d be thinking bad thoughts. Gradually, I’ve let those thoughts go. I’ve got to the stage now where I don’t even remember the names of the guys who killed him. They used to be here.’ He taps his forehead. ‘Slowly, the anger is going away.’          Earlier this week, Neville Lawrence made a pilgrimage of sorts to the bus stop where his 18-year-old son, Stephen, was fatally stabbed 25 years agoToday, Neville, 76, looks a decade younger than the beleaguered man who stood on the Old Bailey steps when two of his son’s murderers, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, were sentenced to life imprisonment six years ago.Those convictions, the first since Stephen’s death, might well have been a victory for justice, but they didn’t ease Neville’s suffering. Nor the suffering of Stephen’s mother, Baroness Lawrence, who, in an emotional interview with this newspaper earlier this month, confessed she hasn’t known true happiness since her son’s death, and spoke of her desire to ‘draw a line’ under her tireless campaigning for Stephen.She also urged police, in the absence of significant leads, to close the investigation.Neville disagrees. ‘After the verdict, I went to my son’s grave in Jamaica. I know a lot of people would say you’re mad talking to somebody who’s dead, but I talk to him. I said: “We’ve got two of them, I don’t know if we’re going to get any more, but we have that satisfaction for the time being.” ’He falls silent and, for a moment, he is thousands of miles away, at the peaceful plot in Jamaica where his son lies buried in the shade of coconut and ackee trees. ‘Knowing my son’s lying there in the ground, sometimes I just go to pieces.‘Even now when I start talking about it, my eyes fill up because I know what kind of person he was — what kind of person he would have been.  For many years, Neville could not even bring himself to drive along the road in South-East London where his desperately wounded son ran for some 350 yards before he fell‘We had some justice, but I’m still hoping for total justice, which is why I don’t want them to close the case. I want them to scale the investigation down, but not close it.‘With all the publicity there is at the moment, someone might decide to come forward and say something they haven’t before.’This week, Stephen’s death has dominated the media.To mark the 25th anniversary, a gripping three-part BBC documentary, Stephen: The Murder That Changed A Nation, examined in forensic detail the senseless murder and the fight for justice, passionately championed by the Daily Mail, which led to the exposure of institutional racism running deep in the Metropolitan Police. The repercussions continue to reverberate throughout every level of society to this day.On Monday, leading dignitaries, including Prince Harry and Prime Minister Theresa May, will gather at a memorial service in London, organised by Baroness Lawrence, to remember Stephen and celebrate all that has been achieved in his name.Until three days ago, Neville thought he wouldn’t be there. He had not been invited, until Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick intervened. Neville does not dwell upon the reasons why he wasn’t on the guest list. He simply says: ‘I wanted to go. It’s my son, but I wasn’t the one arranging it, so what could I do?‘On Wednesday evening, the police commissioner phoned. She said she hadn’t seen an invitation for me, so now I’m going.’The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. In her interview with the Mail two weeks ago, Stephen’s mother said: ‘Neville and I were two different people after that night. They say a tragedy like that either pushes you together or pulls you apart. The latter is exactly what happened.    The Lawrences’ 27-year marriage collapsed in 1999 under the intolerable pain of their son’s death. Pictured: Doreen and Neville Lawrence at the first murder trial ‘In a way, I felt she was blaming me for Stephen’s death. Whether that was right or wrong, I don’t know, but that’s what I was feeling inside.‘Doreen was away on a field trip for her degree when Stephen was murdered. I was supposed to be looking after the children. If something happens to your child when one of you is away, straight away you start thinking: “If I’d been here, maybe it wouldn’t have happened.”‘She hasn’t said she blames me, but I think she does. I know I was blaming myself.’Neville, a talented plasterer and decorator, had been looking after the children for two days when Stephen left for school that day. By nature a warm, jovial man, his spirits had been worn down by a lack of work during the recession.The marriage was, he concedes, going through a difficult patch, but he believed the overriding love they had for their children would help them to weather it.‘I thought I wouldn’t have any children because it took so long to find someone I wanted to marry,’ says Neville. ‘I’d made this promise to myself I would not have a child out of wedlock. I wanted to be married to somebody, so my children could grow up in my house and I could have influence over them.‘Stephen was my first-born child. I was there when he arrived. When he came out of hospital, I was worried all night because there were a lot of cot deaths about at the time. I kept getting up to listen to him breathing.’          A memorial plaque now marks the place with the words: ‘In memory of Stephen Lawrence 13.9.1974 to 22.4.1993. May he Rest in Peace\u0027Neville was a hands-on father who changed nappies and fed his son. He still has the first pair of baby shoes Stephen wore. ‘When he left that day, I was sitting at the window feeling really low about the fact I wasn’t working to support my family.‘He said: “Dad, are you OK?” I said: “Yes I’m fine.” He said: “Are you sure?” I said: “Yes, and remember your mummy’s coming back tonight. I’m going to do dinner, so come straight home from school.” ’But Stephen didn’t come home.Instead, two neighbours knocked on the door to tell Doreen, by now home, and Neville, that Stephen had been attacked. They called police stations and searched the streets. Finding no sign of their son, they went to a nearby hospital and learned he had been admitted.‘When we got to the hospital, I asked where Stephen was. The doctor said: “We’re working on him.” They showed us to a waiting room. When I saw a nurse and doctor walking down the corridor, I’m thinking: “Please, God, let them tell me he’s going to be OK.” They told us he was dead.‘After touching my son on that hospital slab, I can remember nothing else.’Neville’s next memory is waking up the following morning. He thought his son’s death was a bad dream.‘The first thing I did was go to Stephen’s bedroom to see if his bed had been slept in. When I saw it hadn’t, I knew that what I’d remembered was true.‘For a few days, I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t write, I couldn’t do anything. I couldn’t even remember my full name. I was walking around kind of stunted in a way.‘It affected me so much. I was never the Neville who was here before Stephen was murdered. I was different.’          Luke Knight, 41, showed little remorse when confronted ahead of the 25th anniversaryBefore a reporter could question him, the roofer, wearing boxer shorts and a T-shirt, shouted: ‘Oh, f*** off, mate,’ before slamming his door.His outburst came after the BBC broadcast the first of its three-part series on Britain’s most notorious race murder. Earlier, Knight had his trademark swagger as he walked down the street near where he and his cohorts once terrorised locals.In February 1997, the Mail accused Knight’s gang of murdering 18-year-old Stephen in a savage, unprovoked attack as he waited with a friend at a bus-stop on April 22, 1993.Two of the gang, Gary Dobson, now 42, and David Norris, 41, are serving life for the killing, after a forensic breakthrough led to a second murder trial six years ago. A third, Neil Acourt, 42, is in jail for masterminding a £4 million cannabis ring.

He later said there was \u0027blood everywhere\u0027 as a result of the woman\u0027s injuries \u0027The unsafe condition,\u0027 the FAA said in the order, \u0027is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design.\u0027The inspections ordered are a sharp step-up from actions by both the European and U.S. regulators after a Southwest flight in August 2016 made a safe emergency landing in Pensacola, Florida, after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. The European agency had given airlines nine months to check engines, while U.S. regulators still were considering what to do.Ultrasonic inspections on fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or in service for about 20 years, will be required in the next 20 days, the agencies said on Friday. A cycle includes one take-off and landing.  Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two from Albuquerque, died. Southwest Airlines would not reveal on Friday if it had offered her family anything in the form of compensation That order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the United States, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday\u0027s Southwest flight would have been affected, since the company said it had 40,000 cycles.The coordinated 20-day measure partially resolves a gap in previous responses to the 2016 accident by the world\u0027s two largest and most influential aviation regulators, a person familiar with the discussions said and published documents show.The FAA in August 2017 drafted an order giving airline up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalized the measure by the time of Tuesday\u0027s fatal second accident.The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, matching the FAA\u0027s roll-out, saying data did not justify that.The ergence marked a rare difference of approach between the two agencies, especially on one of the world\u0027s most-used aviation products. CFM, which is jointly owned by General Electric Co and France\u0027s Safran, produces the CFM56 engine in factories based both in the United States and in Europe.\u0027It happens that there are disagreements about the right way to go in some cases, and this was one of them,\u0027 the person familiar with the discussions said.On Tuesday, however, when news broke that a second failure had taken place involving the same model engine, aircraft and airline - this time killing a passenger who was partially pulled through a gaping hole next to her seat - the two agencies agreed to act quickly, the person said.          Riordan\u0027s window was smashed by shrapnel from the exploding engine several rows in front of herAn FAA spokesman said the agency disputed that it had not agreed with European regulators on the response to the engine issue. An EASA spokesman declined to comment.On Wednesday, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairman Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of U.S. aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.The FAA and NTSB have different roles. Investigators study the probable cause of single accidents and recommend possible changes to safety rules, while regulators have to assess whether safety risks could appear.Several major airline officials said the order will primarily impact airlines with higher utilization of aircraft covering shorter routes like Southwest.The airline\u0027s CEO Gary Kelly sent a letter to the 142 passengers who survived, apologizing for the \u0027circumstances\u0027 which surrounded the flight and offering their help reuniting them with luggage.No blame has been assigned to the airline for the engine explosion which sent a piece of shrapnel flying through the window next to Riordan.Investigators are still probing what caused the explosion and the plane had been tested for safety just three days before the catastrophe. In its letter, Southwest Airlines pointed to the ongoing National Transport Safety Board investigation into the incident but said its priority was assisting the traumatized survivors. Southwest Airlines is giving passengers on board the disastrous flight $5,000 each and a $1,000 travel voucher. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19dfba37d5f8e247bcbb3bbfd2e0c8de6cb98e30/109_38_1436_862/master/1436.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b6e2d03039d349fba960ac0edbc62d47 1240w","title":"frida kahlo barbie doll mexico injunction","story":"Distant relatives of Frida Kahlo have won a temporary injunction that stops sales of a Barbie doll depicting the late Mexican artist.Kahlo’s great-niece Mara de Anda Romeo argued in a Mexican court that Mattel does not have the rights to use Kahlo’s image as part of its Inspiring Women series.According to a copy of a ruling posted on Thursday, the toymaker and department stores in Mexico must stop commercializing the doll until the issue is resolved.Mattel has said it worked with the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corporation which it claims has rights to the artist’s image.In a Twitter post, the family’s official account, @FridaKahlo, wrote that a Mexico City judge had ordered the Frida Kahlo Corporation to stop using the “brand, image and work of the illustrious painter Frida Kahlo” without permission from the owner of the rights. Critics say the doll does not reflect Kahlo’s heavy, nearly conjoined eyebrows, and its costume does not accurately portray her elaborate Tehuana-style dresses.Barbie is an American icon that has often been criticised as promoting an unrealistic body image and consumerist lifestyle. Kahlo was a lifelong communist who died in 1954. Last month, Mattel said in a statement that it worked with the Panama-based Frida Kahlo Corp, “which owns all the rights”. “The Frida Kahlo Corporation actively participated in the process of designing the doll, Mattel has its permission and a legal contract that grants it the rights to make a doll of the great Frida Kahlo,” the company’s statement said. The corporation said it got the rights through Kahlo’s niece, Isolda Pinedo Kahlo, more than a decade ago. The corporation said that it “celebrates the ideological contributions of Frida Kahlo which have transcended the borders of art and which will influence new generations as a world icon through the Frida Kahlo Barbie, which conserves the essence of Barbie and the legacy of Frida Kahlo”.Barbie marked International Women’s day in March by choosing 17 modern-day and historic role models to honour with a doll in their likeness.Included in the brand’s Inspiring Women series alongside Kahlo are the pioneering aviator Amelia Earhart and Katherine Johnson, the Nasa mathematician who broke race and gender barriers. Johnson, who is now aged 99, was featured in the recent film Hidden Figures.

I could watch Urs Fischer’s snails all day, not least because they’re not trying to tell me anything.Lubaina Himid’s deeply underwhelming painted cut-out dragons cross the vast atrium far above our heads at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. They look like leftovers from Chinese New Year. The installation is cumbersome and forced. Why am I here? The eighth edition of GI is full of false steps and wasted journeys. Sam Keogh has just emerged from some sort of cryogenic pod, marooned on the floor of Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art (GoMA). Keogh, artist-cum-astronaut, has seen better days, and so have I. He tells a very long tale of space exploration, gallons of human sperm and frozen eggs, as his craft malfunctioned somewhere on its mission to seed distant planets with the human race. Part sculpture, part-performance, with yards of plastic, tons of goo and electrical dreck, Keogh’s Kapton Cadaverine has some good gags, but its vision of the grubbiness of interstellar space travel is a familiar trope, especially to anyone who knows how trashed an airplane cabin looks after a long-haul flight. Richard Parry, formerly director of the Grundy Art Gallery in Blackpool, had less than a year to devise the programme. Cellular World: Cyborg-Human-Avatar-Horror, the group show he has devised in the difficult, overdecorated and pillared ground floor gallery at GoMA, plays on familiar tropes of failed dreams and dystopian futures. Jesse Darling’s washing line festoons the indoor sky with snarls of razor-wire, bunting, dishcloths, toys and babywear. John Russell’s billboard-scaled digital image is a kind of modern baroque version of architectural trompe l’oeil painting, continuing the galleries’ succession of pillars within the image itself, and filling the illusory space with a huge elephant’s head. The eyeless tusker looks back at us bleakly, as well it might. Small paintings are perched on the sofas in the British Heart Foundation charity shop. The faces of two young women smile and pout from under a pile of herbs and flowers and cut-out smiles in Linder’s little movie at the Glasgow Women’s Library. They stick out their tongues. Someone chases a herd of deer. Linder’s Bower of Bliss is an imaginary scene from the life of Mary Queen of Scots as if redone by Pipilotti Rist in the Scottish highlands. Graham Eatough and Stephen Sutcliffe’s reworking of Anthony Burgess’s Enderby novels, at Film City, are accompanied by fragments of the sets for their two films. The sets don’t add much and the films themselves are full of hammy, unfunny acting. Commissioned for last year’s Manchester International festival, the films apparently “cajole our notions of what comprises authenticity, posterity and the character of the artist”. They bring nothing new into the world, and my notions remain uncajoled. Over at Tramway, a deeply troubled figure is spotlit in a huge space. Enlarged from a small figurine in the Wellcome Collection, Mark Leckey’s Nobodaddy (titled after a poem by William Blake) is a seated god, full of wounds, holes and knobbly excrescences. His body hides speakers, and a voice fills the surrounding darkened space. A CGI apparition of the same figure hovers on a large screen across the gallery. We delve into his hollowed out innards. Leckey provides the voice of this abject figure, accompanied by horrible gurglings and rumblings and complaints. What a plight. Talk about the crisis of masculinity.The real strength of the citywide, sprawling festival rests on a few works. A live voice accompanies Tai Shani’s Tramway installation Dark Continent: Semiramis. Topless women wearing Spanx figure-shaping pantyhose walk on stage and pose themselves in a tableaux vivant. It is difficult to keep up with the labyrinthine text, apparently an extrapolation from a 1405 proto-feminist text, Christine de Pizan’s The Book of the City of Ladies. The staging is weird, the set a sort of mix of Joan Miró and new age nonsense, including a giant outstretched hand, hanging things that glow like ceramic jewellery, coloured balls and small platonic solids littering the floor, an orange puddle. A pink worm-like gut writhes across the stage. A female voice declaims, alternately soothing and erupting with sex and violence, pleasure and pain. I thought of Angela Carter’s Sadeian Woman and Pasolini’s Salò. To see one performance in Shani’s 12-part cycle is not enough. I need the text. I feel the whole thing is being snatched away even as I look.One of the bravest, edgiest works in this year’s GI, it repels as much as it compels. Shani’s cumbersome, ambitious and flawed performances led me circuitously to a bedroom in a Pollokshields flat, and an astonishing archival display of 1980s underground lesbian erotica, and then to a show of photographs and short films by the 75-year-old German film-maker Ulrike Ottinger at the Hunterian museum.Transgressive, erotic, alarming, unconscionable and marvellous, Ottinger’s work is a call to artistic freedom and formal rigour. Life-affirming and dangerous, she is an accidental mentor to the best younger artists here, and a rejoinder to mediocrity, to things I prefer not to recall. But as much as it is a showcase, or a baggy curatorial conceit, GI still has vitality, even if it feels spread too thin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fec92bb9f43251291dd6c35e994d89d837e361d/0_0_5949_3959/master/5949.jpg?w=5750\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1ee41eae275386ec46709855d2b0f7f 11500w","title":"50 years british photography twiggy whaling in pictures","story":"The Association of Photographers, which represents the UK’s professional photographers, is celebrating its 50th anniversary with AOP50, a retrospective of images curated by Zelda Cheatle.

Just over 80 years later, another American orcee, Meghan Markle, is set to give the British monarchy a new lease of life. Yet Wallis and Meghan have even more in common than just being American and orcees: they have both had biographies about them by me published this year. Some things are truly written in the stars.Meghan’s has been a remarkable journey. Much has been written about the fact that her mother, Doria, was an African-American woman with liquid brown eyes of slave descent, but what is less well known is that her father’s family can trace their ancestry back to Robert the Bruce. So you could say that Meghan was born into royalty, if you didn’t have much material and were desperate to pad out your book to 80,000 words.Although her parents split up when she was five, Meghan has always felt she came from a very loving and stable background. As she once told a Hollywood gossip column reporter when she was desperate to go into acting: “I come from a very loving and stable background. Do you know anyone who could give me a job?”From a very early age, it was obvious to all those around her that Meghan was possessed of a unique talent. At her private school in Los Angeles, she was even cast as the star in a production of The Princess Bride ahead of Scarlett Johansson, who had only just been born. One of the most formative moments of her early life was watching the funeral of Princess Diana on television. Little did she know that less than 20 years later, she would be marrying the young prince who was walking behind his mother’s coffin carrying a copy of Andrew Morton’s fabulous book, Diana: Her True Story In Her Own Words.Have I mentioned that Meghan is biracial? Being biracial has always been an integral part of Meghan’s identity. Largely because her mother was black and her father was white. Just thought I’d mention it. After leaving university, where she narrowly missed out on winning a Nobel prize, Meghan set her heart on becoming an actress and it wasn’t long before the parts came rolling in. Her first role was in a straight-to-DVD film whose name I can’t remember in which she had to say the word: “Hi.” As the producer later told me after hearing Meghan was getting married to Prince Harry: “She was the only actress we auditioned who could say ‘Hi’ as if she meant it.”Her big break came when she was asked to be a regular on Deal or No Deal, a gameshow in which she had to walk on set wearing next to nothing holding up box number 26. As the girl who carried box number 17 told me: “We could tell Meghan was a natural and was going to marry into royalty.” Filming for Deal or No Deal was a demanding process, yet Meghan still managed to fit in a pilates class and get in some charity work in preparation for meeting Prince Harry.At some point or other, Meghan married a film producer called Trevor, but once she had landed a leading part in a TV series called Suits, she decided to let him go by text, as she didn’t want to put him through the glare of publicity. “Meghan has always been really thoughtful like that,” one of her close friends told me.Have I mentioned that Meghan is biracial? Now that Meghan was a Hollywood star whom almost no one outside Hollywood had heard of, she devoted her life to helping others. Along with posting selfies on Instagram and setting up a website to promote organic kale and other lifestyle necessities for biracial women.After dumping various other men who couldn’t help with her career, Meghan had almost resigned herself to being single. But then Cupid’s arrow went a-quiver under the incandescent African skies. (God, who writes this rubbish?) So Meghan and Prince Harry met on a blind date and it was love at first sight. “Hi, I’m Prince Harry,” said Prince Harry. “You had me at Prince,” Meghan gushed.Things moved swiftly after that, and it wasn’t long before Meghan was invited to have tea with the Queen. Using all the skills she had learned as an actress, Meghan spent days rehearsing sipping tea from a cup and eating cucumber sandwiches. The big day went off splendidly and the biggest hurdle of her life had been cleared comfortably. On the way home, Harry asked Meghan to marry him. “I know it won’t be easy and you will have to give up your charity work, but I’d like you to be my wife,” he said.“Oh don’t worry,” she replied. “I’ve always wanted to be a princess. And you’re so hopeless, you can be my very own charity project.”Meghan immediately settled into her new role and every member of the royal family remarked on how brilliantly she shook hands with strangers. “She’s going to be a real asset,” said a minor royal who was still hoping for an invitation to the wedding.Life under the royal glare is never easy, though, and there are some who worry that Meghan may quickly get bored. But hey! If she does, she knows where to come to tell her story.

The directives from the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency indicated rising concerns since a similar failure in 2016 of the same type of engine – a CFM56-7B engine, made by CFM International.The FAA said the engine on Southwest Airlines flight 1380 exploded on Tuesday when a fan blade broke off. The blast shattered a window, killing one woman, in the first US passenger airline fatality since 2009. “The unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same design,” the FAA said in the order.CFM, which is jointly owned by General Electric and France’s Safran, produces the CFM56 engine in factories in the US and Europe. About 14,000 CFM56-7B engines are in operation.In August 2016 a Southwest flight made a safe emergency landing in Florida after a fan blade separated from the same type of engine and debris ripped a hole above the left wing. Following that problem the European agency gave airlines nine months to check engines, while US regulators drafted an order giving airlines up to 18 months to carry out checks, but it had not finalised the measure by the time of Tuesday’s damage. The EASA had rejected a request by one airline to double the time allowed for checks to 18 months, saying data did not justify it.Airlines must now make ultrasonic inspections of fan blades that have been used in more than 30,000 cycles, or have been in service for about 20 years, within the next 20 days. A cycle includes one take-off and landing. The order will affect about 680 engines globally, including about 350 in the US, the FAA said. The engine that blew apart on Tuesday had done 40,000 cycles, the company said.The CFM56 engine is used on about 1,800 Boeing 737 planes in service in the US and about 6,400 worldwide.  On Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board chairman, Robert Sumwalt, the chief investigator of US aviation accidents, said he could not yet say if the incident pointed to a fleet-wide issue. The NTSB declined to comment on Friday.Several major airline officials said the order would primarily affect airlines with higher use of aircraft covering shorter routes. Southwest, which had opposed efforts by CFM last year to shorten the FAA’s proposed 18-month deadline, said on Friday that its maintenance programme met or exceeded the new requirements.The European order states that after the first inspection, airlines must repeat the process every 3,000 cycles, which typically represents about two years in service. More than 150 have already been inspected.Inspections recommended by the end of August will affect an additional 2,500 engines."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a13f118d1248efa1ecec5640b4ee2ca5df256bf/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=afffec38ab9a04b871f58413ebe26465 1240w","title":"ministers scroungers lose forms pm windrush","story":"Lose one form, and you lose cancer treatment and your liberty – lose a generation’s forms, and you’re the effing PMIf I were editing a tabloid newspaper this week – and I’m always open to guest stints – I would have had advertising vans out since Monday. They would have been crawling v-e-r-y slowly back and forth past the houses of Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Nick Timothy and David Cameron – and those just for starters. Instead of the repulsive GO HOME message that adorned the infamous vans May’s Home Office sent out, which resulted in the eventual deportation of precisely 11 migrants, I would have something along the lines of STAY HOME. Stay home, permanently.Whether they would get the message is uncertain. Collectively, Britain did its very best to provide a hostile environment for May with the election result. The message was very clear: take a hike. Not a hiking holiday, but the full hike.Who are the Windrush generation?They are people who arrived in the UK after the second world war from Caribbean countries at the invitation of the British government. The first group arrived on the ship MV Empire Windrush in June 1948.What is happening to them?An estimated 50,000 people face the risk of deportation if they never formalised their residency status and do not have the required documentation to prove it.\u0026nbspWhy is this happening now?It stems from a policy, set out by Theresa May when she was home secretary,\u0026nbspto make the UK \u0027a really hostile environment for illegal immigrants\u0027. It requires employers, NHS staff, private landlords and other bodies to demand evidence of people’s citizenship or immigration status.Why do they not have the correct paperwork and status?Some children, often travelling on their parents’ passports, were never formally naturalised and many moved to the UK before the countries in which they were born became independent, so they assumed they were British. In some cases, they did not apply for passports. The Home Office did not keep a record of people entering the country and granted leave to remain, which was conferred on anyone living continuously in the country since before 1 January 1973.What is the government doing to resolve the problem?On Monday, the home secretary Amber Rudd\u0026nbspannounced the creation of a new Home Office team\u0026nbspdedicated to ensuring that Commonwealth-born long-term UK residents would no longer find themselves classified as being in the UK illegally.Yet the import does not seem to have got through to the prime minister, or the various arse-coverers around her. It’s fair to say we are dealing with a very specific class of unworthy here. There are few groups who take less responsibility for their actions, as this week in the Windrush scandal has laid starkly bare. Some of the most senior political figures in the land are – in the purest sense of one of their favourite terms – shirkers. They are feckless. They act like these things are happening to them, as opposed to because of them. Given the judgments they like to visit on the weaker members of society for comparatively minuscule transgressions, this makes them the most raging hypocrites too.In the Home Office, Amber Rudd can’t even commit to a personal pronoun. “I am concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy, and sometimes loses sight of the inidual,” was the verdict of the specific inidual who is the actual home secretary, and who was clearly very much wishing people would lose sight of her. Complete tools always blame their workmen, and the civil servants union chief has now come out to imply this of Rudd.In No\u0026nbsp10 Rudd’s Home Office predecessor still, bogglingly, resists any personal blame. In one of his newspaper columns, May’s former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, claims – wrongly – that May was against the vans and was on holiday or something, while referring to the “so-called hostile environment policy” when it was literally called so by him and his boss. Meanwhile David Cameron – in pursuit of whose ludicrous back-of-a-napkin immigration targets all this was done – disembarked from the gravy train momentarily this week to ignore the subject entirely in a CNN interview.And on they all go. If the government is in any doubt as to why so many millions think it’s one rule for them and another for the little people, then this week couldn’t be a better primer. You lose one form and you lose your job, your cancer treatment, your benefits, your liberty you lose a generation’s forms and you’re the effing prime minister. Those condemned to battle the systems that ministers design know what happens if they make tiny errors. Furthermore, they know that if they messed up a tenth as badly in their jobs, they’d be sacked. But in the arse-over-tit world of government, you’re safe because your sacking would make the big boss – May – look weak. Just like your HR department, right? Except on crystal meth.I don’t want to fall back on a series of politicians’ best-loved cliches, but this level of irresponsibility is just scrounging with a red box. They play for high stakes – but never their own. It’s the sort of system-milking demonised in a benefits office in Grimsby but regarded as career progression in Westminster. It makes it appear there’s no glass ceiling in modern political life, just a reinforced lead floor. Once you’re in, you basically have to die to stop earning rewards. Take Timothy, who we can’t describe as back on his bullshit, because he’s never been off it. I’ve had yoghurts in my fridge longer than he was in the political wilderness. Or Cameron, whose CNN interview saw him still regurgitating his catchphrase “it was the right thing to do”. I do hope his forthcoming book embraces the absurdity, and is called All the Right Things to Do that I Did.Perhaps the most staggering part – for those of us not being imprisoned or barred from our mother’s funerals, I should stress – is how little self-awareness our leaders have about their failures and their own part in them. May still reckons the worst thing she ever did was run through a wheat field.I saw this show several times. Even if you weren’t the Self-Knowledge Impregnator’s target, you could still see the word every time you shut your eyes for ages afterwards. Don’t tell me we don’t invent beautiful machines in this country any more.Or at least we did. That was 21 years ago. Where is the Self-Knowledge Impregnator now? Has the hour of need ever been greater? Can’t it be strapped to the back of an advertising van and driven at top speed to the next cabinet meeting, in the name of human decency?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6644e0cd0bc5268184e0fbbee5473449cbdf4534/0_177_3628_2177/master/3628.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=5a5464870c18c00e705f1429547b53f5 1240w","title":"black art kendrick lamar pulitzer literature rap","story":"Rap should be put on a par with Shakespeare and Wordsworth. When will the education system wake up to black creativity?I can’t help thinking that the Pulitzer prize committee missed a trick in their award to the rapper Kendrick Lamar this week. If they had given him the Pulitzer for literature rather than for music it would have elevated his artform and sent a message that would have resonated around the world: that rap is a legitimate form of poetry and should be put on a par with, and treated with the same deference as, Shakespeare and Wordsworth.Let’s be honest, Kendrick Lamar, Stormzy, BBK and Giggs have a greater impact and more relevance today than all the literary “greats” wandering lonely as a cloud on some dusty bookshelf in some crusty corner, waiting to be forced down the school curriculum gullets of young people.If the Pulitzer people had only bitten the bullet and done the equivalent of what the Nobel committee did for Bob Dylan and rock lyrics when they said, “You know what? We’re going to get dissed and ridiculed for even putting Dylan on the same level as John Steinbeck, but what the heck. Let’s just do it and take the flak.” Who knows what the idend would have been for wider society?In Tottenham, where I am from, literary recognition would transform every other young black boy writing rhymes. It would stick two fingers up at the notion that the only way young black boys can get respect is on the streets. Contrary to popular belief, young black boys spend more time writing poetry than they do stabbing and shooting each other. For real. They have transformed the English language with an unparalleled lyrical dexterity. But we refuse to acknowledge that – even on Roger McGough’s Poetry Please on Radio 4.It is shocking. But the fact there is no recognition of this “new English” in our classrooms is criminal. No wonder so many youngers are bored out of their skulls and headed right down the “schools-to-prison pipeline” – as Cheryl Phoenix of the Black Child Agenda calls it – when they should be in class learning. Believe me, if the lyrics of Biggie Smalls were on the GCSE reading list, state education wouldn’t be failing our children. And if there had been an O-level in rap when I was at school I would have been the first person through the school gates every morning and the last person out. I wouldn’t have been expelled, and I certainly wouldn’t have burned down the chemistry lab.And big up Her Majesty for recognising that in her New Year honours list, which acknowledged homegrown rap poetry by giving a gong to grime artist Wiley. So why isn’t the rest of high society following QE2’s lead? Isn’t the measure of any civilised society how it treats its rappers? If it was white kids spending so much time writing poetry, would the government not be co-opting the phenomenon as a standard bearer for this amazing country we live in?And, please, don’t start talking about the content or the character of these rap poems and blaming it for the gun and knife deaths this year. Aim that vitriol at the opening exchange of Romeo and Juliet, where Samson and Gregory talk of stabbing up the Montagues and doing unspeakable things to their women. Let’s face it, the play needs a “parental advisory” sticker because it would have run foul of the obscenity laws that saw Lady Chatterley’s Lover being dragged into court in 1960.If we’re asking our children to read filth such as Shakespeare in school, and turning a blind eye to the content because it has been deemed by the gatekeepers of literary imperialism, known as “the canon”, as beyond moral reproach and contemporary social responsibility, then we cannot blame Eminem for corrupting the minds of our youths.Indeed, the corruption is from us, the guardians of their mindsets, in refusing to make the connection between Romeo and Juliet and Straight Outta Compton. I challenge any English teacher to make a comparative study between the lyrics of the title rap from NWA’s debut album and that opening scene of Romeo and Juliet and tell me they’re not the same thing. The only difference is that an AK-47 is Ice Cube’s tool, whereas Samson vows to stab any man or maid of Montague’s.When schools neglect their duty it is left to black parents in particular, in this respect, but wider society in general, and the arts, to pick up the pieces and make the change. As the new chair of the Bernie Grant Arts Centre in Tottenham, in these most challenging times for my neighbourhood, I’m trying to give our youngers their due and to turn this incredible venue into a safe space to “spit bars” and make the connection with the past 100 years of black British musical creativity.

Thank goodness long walks and gardening offer a healthy alternativeMarathons, marathons, everywhere: last weekend Brighton was taken over by runners, and tens of thousands more will fill the streets of London on Sunday. In the next few weeks there will be races taking place across the UK, from Milton Keynes to Liverpool, Newport to Stirling. The popularity of the 26.2-mile challenge shows no signs of waning – the Brighton event only started in 2010, and now 12,000 people take part. There are 40,000 places in the London race, and a whopping 386,050 people applied this year – the highest number ever. The majority of them had never run a marathon before.I have several friends who ran the Brighton marathon this year, and I have nothing but admiration for their endurance and determination. But watching them prepare and recover has also brought home to me what an extreme sport marathon running really is. Legend has it that Pheidippides, the original marathon man, collapsed and died after his exertions – and although these days people usually survive the ordeal, they ain’t looking too pretty afterwards.This week’s record-breaking temperatures have led to warnings from the London race organisers that runners should “adjust their goal” and reconsider any plans to run in fancy dress. One Brighton friend, who was waiting for her husband at the finish line last Sunday, reports that the runners had all turned a strange shade of blue. After giving her husband a congratulatory hug she asked how\u0026nbsphe’d got on. “Well, it’s over,” he replied. “And I’ve just vomited.”Why do so many people want to do this to themselves?\u0026nbspThe health benefits of long-distance running are debatable: there is, unsurprisingly, a high risk of injury, and health experts regularly point out that\u0026nbspif you want to be fit and toned you’d be better off doing a range of strength and cardio exercise than spending five hours a week pounding the pavement. The\u0026nbsppaleo diet and health guru Chris Kresser goes further, arguing that our bodies have not evolved to cope with large amounts of moderate-intensity exercise\u0026nbsp(running falls into this category), and that it can\u0026nbsphave a host of detrimental effects, including depressing the immune system and disrupting cortisol\u0026nbsplevels, which can apparently promote weight\u0026nbspgain. His recipe for a healthy exercise regime is to move frequently at a slow pace, lift heavy things, and\u0026nbspsprint occasionally.Obviously, completing a marathon confers a level of glory that “lifting heavy things occasionally” can never hope to match – and no doubt there are also arguments in favour of running. But we certainly live in a society of body extremes. On the one hand, we have an obesity epidemic and a raging addiction to processed junk food on the other, we are obsessed with “clean eating” and feats of endurance.Both are manifestations of the same fear and confusion about bodies. Who and what are bodies for, in our post-industrial era? The economy values them primarily for their ability to consume. Those of us who work in desk jobs treat them as vehicles for our brains, ignoring their needs and wasting their potential while we tap away at keyboards and snack on biscuits. The temptation is to compensate for this neglect by pushing\u0026nbspthem too far – punishing them, even – in our leisure time.Personally, I’m aiming for that large and agreeable middle ground between bingeing on Big Macs and Netflix, and grinding out 26 miles. I’m thinking a bracing\u0026nbspcountry walk somewhere beautiful, followed by tea and a scone Saturdays spent digging at the allotment, and wolfing down a stew when I get home.\u0026nbspI’m thinking a decent walk in the morning before\u0026nbspI sit down at my desk, and a few sea swims once I work up the courage. And the best thing is that my totally unscientific hunch – that the healthiest activities\u0026nbspinvolve getting some fresh air, working up an appetite and also enjoying yourself – has now won its own expert cheerleaders. It even has an impressive-sounding technical name: low-intensity steady state (Liss) exercise.So if you are running the marathon this weekend – all power to you, and good luck. But if you’re not, you too can feel the golden glow of righteousness. Walk the dog, take some deep breaths, soak up some sunshine. The health benefits of having a nice day might be greater than you think.• Alice O’Keeffe is a freelance literary critic and journalist"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a11b7641c6830dca43cc7baee6125403ec1ef26e/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=54133e519b80b4803a160b9843b8fcb3 1240w","title":"people using fly tipping firms face crackdown","story":"Measures would demand ‘all reasonable measures’ are taken to ensure handlers are licensedPeople who have their rubbish dumped illegally could face fines of up to £400, even if they do not personally engage in fly-tipping, under proposals being considered by ministers.The measures are aimed at tackling people who charge householders to take away their rubbish and then dump it illegally. They build on existing powers to issue on-the-spot fines to save the hefty court costs often involved in pursuing offenders.The Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra) said on Friday it was considering responses to a consultation it opened in January, including the proposal that fines could be imposed on anyone found not to have taken “all reasonable measures” to ensure their household waste was dealt with by licensed handlers.According to the Daily Mail, Coffey said she was “determined to stamp out an anti-social crime that blighted the countryside and our streets”.Under the proposals, householders could be fined if the unlicensed firm they hand their rubbish to goes on to fly-tip it. They would not, however, be held responsible if that firm handed the material over to a third party, which disposed of it illegally.The consultation proposed that the default penalty be set at £200, with a minimum default penalty of £150 and a maximum full penalty of £400.Announcing the consultation on 15 January, the government said household waste made up “nearly two-thirds of fly-tipped waste”. Ministers said local authorities were only able to prosecute householders in court and suggested a fixed penalty notice would be less costly to enforce. “The government is clear, however, that new fixed penalty notices should not be abused simply as a means of raising money.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cab6bccae5bc617e6ce6f6b3a8931ce7d3bfd43/0_0_2500_1875/master/2500.jpg?w=480\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=61bb9550da471fad96c076611c09abb8 960w","title":"duck butter review alia shawkat","story":"Search Party’s Alia Shawkat falls for a Manic Pixie Dream Girl in this occasionally daring but ultimately exhausting 24-hour love storyWriter Mike White and director Miguel Arteta have quietly become one of the most effective yet underrated double acts working in independent film. They’ve created a string of nuanced, darkly funny, usually female-centric films and even one TV show, starting in 2000 with uncomfortable stalker comedy Chuck \u0026amp Buck. Since then they’ve given Jennifer Aniston her best role to date in The Good Girl, gifted us with the criminally short-lived Laura Dern HBO show Enlightened, and most recently delivered Beatriz at Dinner, one of the sharpest films to tackle the current fractured state of the US.As the film starts out, we’re almost in mockumentary territory with Shawkat playing an actor living in Hollywood working on the set of a film surrounded by recognizable figures playing themselves. But as Naima, she’s a far less established face in the industry, trying to impress in a small role in a Duplass brothers indie. Her desire to control proves problematic on her first day and she ends up drowning her sorrows alongside friend Ellen (Mae Whitman) at a local bar that night. When the women around her couple up, Naima becomes intrigued by offbeat stage performer Sergio (Laia Costa) and the two end up dancing.As their initial attraction moves beyond the bar and back to Sergio’s house, a plan is concocted, one driven by frustrations felt during previous relationships. What if they pressed fast-forward and experienced the ups and downs of it all in just 24 hours, without sleep, and with sex on the hour? Naima is reticent but after she’s fired from her film she returns, eager to take a chance.Despite a recent boom in LGBT cinema, there’s been a curious absence of films centred around the ‘L’, with most same-sex romance existing for just the one sex. Arteta’s film, if nothing else, is a proudly undiluted entry in the underpopulated world of lesbian film that, together with Sebastian Lelio’s Disobedience, literary romance Vita and Virginia, and Desiree Akhavan’s Sundance hit The Miseducation of Cameron Post, makes 2018 something of a boom year. But while Duck Butter does help to benefit an underserved audience, it’s a film that proves difficult to fall for, despite its heady theme of intense romance. It’s essentially a chamber piece that takes place mainly in Sergio’s house, with just the two leads on screen. And while Shawkat’s nervy, controlling actor feels messily real, there’s something a bit too Manic Pixie Dream Girl about the object of her affection. The dynamic of a neurotic finding their life transformed by a free spirit is Romantic Comedy 101, and in order to sell such a connection, the latter often treads a fine line between fascinatingly magnetic and annoyingly affected.Costa, whose striking face dominated 2015’s technically audacious thriller Victoria, is a compelling presence, but her character is so exhaustingly over-mannered it’s hard to see why anyone would see the appeal of spending 24 hours with her. The gimmick of a couple trying to condense a relationship into a day is intriguing, and speaks to a dating landscape dominated by people who are easily distracted and romantically tentative, but it becomes incredibly difficult to genuinely care about the micro-dramas that the pair encounter. Watching a couple bicker about the specifics of their relationship can be illuminating when done right, but here it becomes a chore, the problems they encounter feeling contrived and silly. After their seemingly endless day together, it’s hard to feel invested in what might happen to them next, despite committed performances from Shawkat and Costa.It’s daring – and it really shouldn’t be in 2018 – to see a film so comfortably uncensored in its portrayal of lesbian sex and the female body, and there’s something unglamorous about how it’s shot, never edging into male fantasy territory. But there’s just so much of it, so much sex that it ultimately has a numbing effect, like a lo-fi entry in the Fifty Shades franchise.As Brad’s Status suffered without Arteta’s confident visual eye, Duck Butter is sorely missing White’s sharp characterization. One hopes they find their way back to each other soon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36fd54b49f6f5d79d8b50611f6780e828eb88972/139_33_2292_1376/master/2292.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6578a4b16acb60163f7c04b7b3418db5 1240w","title":"arsene wenger legacy arsenal lee dixon","story":"My former manager may be feeling pain and relief over his decision to step down but should be remembered for rewriting the modern managerial handbookI will always remember the day before I retired, before the last game of the season in 2002, I went to Arsène’s office and knocked on his door. I had not actually had the face-to-face chat with him about retiring. It had been joked about around the dressing room – “Oh, Dicko is packing in” – and my contract was up but I hadn’t actually had a proper conversation with the manager about it. In a way I needed him to confirm to me it was all over.I knocked on the door, perhaps trying to grab another year off him, and offered to hang around the dressing room and be a nuisance. He let me down gently. He leaned back in his chair and said, “No, Lee. It is time.” It was like a dagger and yet it was done for the right reasons. It was also a massive relief. He essentially gave me permission – it was OK to walk away because I had done enough. Maybe he has looked in the mirror and had that same chat I had with him but with himself. It is time, Arsène.I expect he is feeling that mixture of emotions – the pain of the dagger and the calm of the relief. Up until recently I would have thought he would not allow that relief to enter his body because he is a very proud man, a fighter, a winner, set in his ways. Until recently he believed he could turn it around and prove his point to all those people saying “Wenger Out” – he believed he could show that his way could still work. Of late, though, the pressure and maybe the state of the team might have tipped it. That will be really difficult for him and it does make me feel sad. Change of this nature can be massively challenging. It is an institution being a footballer or a manager. It can feel like a scary place outside there. I will be flabbergasted if he goes and sits in his garden and puts his feet up.If he has his relief, so do we. We can now focus on how great he was and the legacy he leaves. All of the problems the team has in what is a results business had got in the way and made that difficult. Although there are still a few important results on the line this season, getting this big decision out in the open means we can look at the bigger picture and give him the send-off he absolutely deserves.Win 2-0 against Blackburn in Wenger’s first match in chargeDefeat Everton 4-0 to win Premier League titleBeat Newcastle 2-0 to lift FA Cup and complete the doubleWenger offers to replay Sheffield United following controversial FA Cup winLost 4-1 on penalties to Galatasaray in Uefa Cup finalWin 1-0 at Old Trafford to win the league titleA 2-2 draw at rivals Spurs confirms third league title winBeat Leicester 2-1 to complete The Invincibles’ unbeaten seasonFinal game at HighburyDefeated 2-1 in Champions League final by BarcelonaLose 8-2 to Manchester United at Old TraffordMarks 1,000th game in charge by losing 6-0 at ChelseaWins record-breaking seventh FA Cup with victory over ChelseaDespite defeating Everton 3-1, they finish outside the top four for first time in Wenger eraAnnounces he will leave Arsenal at the end of the seasonThere is no doubt he changed the face of English football. He was the first. It was all him. His legacy is not only Arsenal based. It is English football-based because of where the game was when he came in and how clubs and players operated. The physiology side of the game, the social side, training – he came in and ripped up the handbook. Everybody said, “Who is this fella?” and the next minute they were all copying him.The advancements in terms of science and facilities and all the support available for elite athletes is testament to him. I truly believe he pushed the button to start all of that. It is easy to lose track of the fact he was the great innovator.What kind of manager do Arsenal need now? I am caught a little bit between two schools of thought. Although Arsène was not an Arsenal man when he came in, it was not long after he joined that he realised all the traditions of the club matched his own. I believe he bought into that really early. So I want someone who has that in his blood. That would suggest someone who has been at the club or an ex-player. Patrick Vieira has so many Wenger qualities and he loves the club and would adhere to its traditions but obviously he has ties with another Premier League team who have taken him under their wing so that might not be possible.Another part of me wants someone like Max Allegri, whose stature and the way he works is impressive. He has a touch of an Italian George Graham about him, which appeals as well. A mixture of those two types would be perfect but, if there is one person who has both elements, I don’t know who that would be. It is a huge job. It is a massive football club and there is a lot of work to be done with a squad that now has holes in it. The philosophy of the team that will evolve under a new manager will be interesting to see.I have huge respect for Arsène’s integrity. He has gone through his 22 years with such grace and, if he sometimes fell below the standards he set, that is the passion coming out. His loyalty to the club is massive. He has cherished that relationship. I love and respect what Arsène has done but it has been difficult seeing the same mistakes being made.Personally I could spend hours in his company every day talking about football. I will miss Arsène massively.Lee Dixon played as Arsenal’s right-back from 1988-2002"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b184fbb0e1dd78da49b8c753721fbf1ace08fe/0_556_4016_2408/master/4016.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d6f29f85b71645ab131d08b8253ab22b 1240w","title":"single disabled broody considering options","story":"My connective tissue disorder is complicated and it would be dangerous for me to carry and deliver a baby – but my heart aches to be a motherAs a single, disabled woman, I can work I should work. I can love I should love. I can own property, drive a car, or run a business. My independence is actively encouraged, my community contribution praised and respected. I’m adding the riches of my skills, experience and passion to society rather than draining its resources.But to be a mother? To potentially give birth to a disabled child? I don’t know about that one. I’m not sure that’s allowed.I’m 41 and for most of my life it’s been a given that I would never have a child. In fact, when I\u0026nbspwas 18 I was told never to have children by an NHS genetic counsellor whose advice my parents wanted me to seek on all sorts of aspects of entering adulthood.At the age of 18, motherhood was something I had never considered, so this stranger’s life-changing conclusion not only made sense, it didn’t seem to matter.Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2013. Relationships either hadn’t worked out or had never really taken off. My friends had begun parenting in earnest, and my sister had given birth to twins, with whom I was immediately smitten. I was 37 and started to hear my heart whisper, “You want to be a mother. It’s time.” It was a conviction that did nothing but grow, from an exciting light-touch desire to a deep, desperate ache.And so, still adhering to the received wisdom that I should not become pregnant, I set the wheels in motion to adopt, making huge changes to my life to give me the best possible chance.Adoption ticked all the boxes: I didn’t need to worry about passing on my wonky genes, I didn’t need a partner, and I could support and advocate for a child who was different, drawing on all the experience, empathy and resilience that a lifetime of disability has given me. And they are desperate for adopters, right?Of course, I realised my health would create some hurdles. I am used to that. Travel companies, schools, volunteering organisations, gyms, potential boyfriends, to all of these over the years I have appeared, let’s say… complicated. But I’ve almost always challenged and overcome their misconceptions. OK, less so with the potential boyfriends – which I suppose was what had got me here in the first place.I was six months into the process with my local authority when, amid a fuzzy cloud of platitudes, they suddenly turned me down as a prospective adopter. Yes, I felt knocked back. But the first rule of being disabled applied: if at first you’re told no, find someone more enlightened who will say yes.Except, 14 adoption agencies and two years later, I was running out of options. Every reason I was given boiled down to my being single or disabled or both, even if only implicitly.Not only was each rejection a heart-breaking step backwards from my ever more intense dreams of motherhood but also, without me even realising it, my confidence was being chipped away. I was beginning to feel stupid for ever believing I could have been a solo parent.Another painful Mothering Sunday arrived. As a regular churchgoer, I forced myself to attend the service but nobody was ever going to call me Mummy. And I needed to begin to accept that.Yet there’s a truth most disabled people know all too well: biology doesn’t go away. The so-called “genetic spelling mistake” in my DNA may be real, but so too is my desire to be a mum. It’s going nowhere. If I don’t confront it, it will consume me. I can’t let that happen. I have struggled with, overcome, buried and beaten into submission too many other things to let this defeat me.So here I am, 41. Still single, still disabled, still broody. And considering my options. One can already be ruled out: the law concerning surrogacy for single people is complicated and so makes it virtually impossible. But I have applied to be a foster carer, despite a niggling concern that fostering is an offer to do a job rather than an opportunity to be a parent. I’ve heard that long-term foster placements can be as good as adoptions, but I will need convincing.And there is another prospect, on paper at least. The last thing I expected to be considering, even in a relationship, and the first thing that was ruled out for me: pregnancy.It may not be possible and would probably come at great financial and physical cost, presenting all sorts of risks and uncertainties to me and a child. Not to mention the burden it would put on family and friends, the NHS, the benefit system and possibly even social services. But no doctor, social worker, sibling or parent could actually stop me.Yes, I know I’m single. But this is the 21st century – there are ways and means. I\u0026nbspcould get a sperm donor, maybe even an egg donor as well, and do in vitro fertilisation. I could find a\u0026nbsplover willing to forgo contraception. Phone a friend, even. But whichever way I tried, having a birth-child as a\u0026nbspsingle, disabled woman would be fraught with dilemmas. Mostly, I worry it’s highly irresponsible and selfish. And I would therefore be susceptible to great disapproval, not only from strangers but also from close friends and family.My parents and sisters were supportive of my attempts to adopt and know I’m considering fostering. But for the past 25 years, the unspoken story among us has been that I probably couldn’t –\u0026nbspand really mustn’t – have a birth child.Ingrained family narratives are hard to disrupt. A pregnancy under these circumstances isn’t on their radar. So, I haven’t yet involved them in my thinking. While I’m still not sure of my own feelings and choices, I’m not ready to deal with their shock, concern and understandable instincts to protect me. I will involve them eventually, just not yet.In other matters, my family – and for the most part, wider society – continue to take the view that I am no different from anyone else.But pregnancy when you are disabled, and might have a disabled baby, somehow seems beyond what is socially acceptable. Especially as an active choice, rather than something I might fall into unplanned. It’s certainly not within the realm of what’s (horrible word) “normal”. It also makes me vulnerable. Here I would be, saying openly and deliberately to the world: I want this. I actually desperately want this.And I think I hear the world reply: that poor, deluded, hormonal woman whose ticking clock, mouldy eggs and dried-up womb are driving her to madness and desperation. She’s out of her mind. She’s had more than she might have expected, given the circumstances. Can’t she just be grateful for what she has?Well, world, I have never let the lack of health or\u0026nbspthe lack of a man stop me doing anything. All the risky, “If they say you can’t, prove them wrong” things I have done as a disabled woman, from travelling the world to starting my own business, I have flourished in. Why should this be\u0026nbspany different?One huge reason: those things never had as much impact on the life of another human being.\u0026nbspThey never involved creating another human being.But surely the weight of this multi-life-changing decision is also felt by healthy single women who choose to have children on their own? Or disabled women having children with a partner? Or any woman – or man – starting a family? Behind my medical history and relationship status, I’m not much different from them. I’m just a woman with a natural instinct to find fulfilment in nurturing a\u0026nbspyoung life. I am as human as anyone else. Doesn’t that tell me all I need to know?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/591b1dc7bdbdcaa1d0e444becbacd5b49ebc5d5b/0_1699_4872_2923/master/4872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8897b9d7ed3d507d385e71805727da96 1240w","title":"stephen graham actor q and a interview","story":"The actor on being knocked over by a taxi, not putting the toilet seat down and falling seven storeys off a car parkBorn in Lancashire, Stephen Graham, 44, attended Liverpool’s Everyman Youth Theatre.

It’s not my first choice. Not that I don’t get on with them – I do, but before I went travelling I lived in London and had moved away to university, so I’ve had my taste of freedom. Compared with some people’s parents, mine are very generous. They don’t make me pay rent. My mum calls me a “boomerang child”.I’ve got a new job as a property auctioneer’s assistant in London. I’ll be doing the sales pitches and the prep for the auctions. When I started earning money, my attitude towards it changed – I became thrifty.When I commuted to London, before I went travelling, I took the slow train rather than the fast one to save £250 a month. I never buy lunch. I take my own just because I know that had I spent £8 a day on it, I wouldn’t have been able to go travelling. I also always get the bus rather than the tube to save costs.I owe the Student Loans Company £42,000, which I borrowed to study geography at Newcastle University. I knew when I signed up that I would have it. So it doesn’t hang over me every day. I pay it back in tiny amounts compared with what I earn. I think it’s worth it. I wouldn’t be where I am if I hadn’t got a degree.I have tallied up how long it will take to save up a £20,000 deposit for a house, and, on my current salary, setting aside money at the rate I was doing to go travelling, it will take seven years. Even then, I won’t be able to afford to buy in London. I’d have to move elsewhere and be realistic about the kind of property I can afford. I don’t think it’s unachievable.When I left Newcastle I moved back home, and that summer I worked as a waitress at Wimbledon. Because of the tips I made quite a lot of money. In two weeks I earned roughly £1,500, which I was able to save. I then did an internship with the local planning department for four months and was paid £100 a week. At that point, I really didn’t have any money. I did struggle and didn’t do a lot.That winter I did a ski season in Val d’Isère in France, which I paid for out of my savings from Wimbledon. They said I’d earn a good wage out there, but what they didn’t mention was that they’d deduct money for a ski pass, equipment, insurance and accommodation, and I was just left with minimal spending money a day.When I came back from the ski season I worked for Savills for a year on £22,500. I saved up £8,000 as I knew I wanted to travel. While away I worked in a coffee shop in Sydney. I stayed with a family and got bed and board in return for walking their dog.I want to move back to London, but I’m waiting for my boyfriend, who’s travelling, before I do. We used to rent a room in a house in Clapham Junction for £850 a month plus bills, which we split. I won’t pay that kind of price on my own, although I know a lot of people do.My new job is going to sponsor me to do a master’s and an APC surveyor’s qualification concurrently. It will mean studying evenings and weekends. I worked hard at university, I got a first class, so I know the work that needs to go in and the rewards afterwards. In terms of the next five years, I’ll be staying put and trying to work my way up, qualifying as a surveyor so I can ultimately earn more money."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f2e446544fbdfcb07fe4e36724947338713aea9/0_338_5509_3306/master/5509.jpg?w=5500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a7220c63a0360cb1c393c59fc37e19c 11000w","title":"the best tiny homes for sale in pictures","story":"These properties may be small, but they’re packed with character – and in one case, have their own model village"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cae45a39aa4e3088e938edb7884ed2c793e897a3/0_118_3511_2106/master/3511.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bbca9f6a0a009324b363d9413c410f22 1240w","title":"avicii appreciation the poster boy for edm who struggled with the spotlight","story":"The death of the 28-year-old Swedish DJ and producer marks a tragic end to an illustrious career underpinned by pressure Avicii was an avatar as much as he was a producer. Exploding on to the scene in 2011 with his unabashedly saccharine hit Levels, the Swedish musician born Tim Bergling represented, depending on where one stood, either the best or worst of dance music’s rise in the United States.Just 21 years old at the time of his breakthrough, Bergling was perhaps an unlikely star. All cheekbones and platinum hair, he never seemed entirely comfortable in the spotlight. Friends and colleagues described him as shy and quiet, a sweet kid with the heart of a technician. In interviews, his responses could come off as canned or reticent, as reporters probed for answers from an artist seemingly more comfortable at his computer assembling tracks. But his music was a different story. Avicii was one of the first EDM stars to arrive on the scene fully formed, and he hit just as dance music was for the first time gaining mainstream popularity in the US. Discovered on MySpace by veteran Dutch producer Laidback Luke, Bergling took his name from the Buddhist term for hell, avīci, and began pumping out an arsenal of hits that quickly defined a burgeoning genre. Tracks including Levels, Fade Into Darkness and Silhouettes were slick, massive, earnest and unapologetically pop-oriented. With them, Avicii paid homage to influences like Swedish House Mafia and Daft Punk while at the same time creating the tension build and release template still being replicated nearly a decade later. These tracks became anthems for the millions of millennials gathering at massive festivals to partake in the relentlessly escapist electronic music scene of the late aughts. Avicii’s music was wildly popular among a generation coming of age in the post 911 era of perpetual war and economic uncertainty. While grunge and hip-hop had been the bluntly angry clarion calls for previous generations, EDM provided these kids with the spirit of celebration and unity that ran counter to headlines on the nightly news. EDM was collective catharsis, and Avicii was, for a time, the biggest artist delivering it. He was anti-politic, existing in a bubble of champagne and confetti bursts, and his music served as a sonic antidepressant for listeners around the world.It was a dance dance revolution that didn’t sit well with many veteran scenesters who had been plugging away in the electronic music underground since the late 70s. Shiny, populist and capitalist to its core, EDM ran counter to the defining values held dear by many fringe-dwelling old school scenesters. The kids didn’t care. And neither did Avicii, who crisscrossed the globe headlining the world’s biggest dance music and mainstream pop festivals – Tomorrowland, Ultra Miami, EDC Las Vegas, Coachella and more – and signing on for massively lucrative Las Vegas residences just as the city was establishing itself as the United States’ EDM hub. Through the guidance of his manager Ash Pournouri, a Svengali type with whom Avicii was deeply close, Avicii raised the pay grade for DJs throughout the scene, pushing into the mid six figures for festival and club sets. With his head floating on billboards along the interstate from Los Angeles to Vegas, he was literally the EDM poster boy. Onstage, Bergling typically sported jeans, a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap, with his right hand lifted and moving along to the music while he happily shuffled behind the decks. If he was uncomfortable in the media, the stage seemed to be a sweet spot. He once called attention the worst part of his job, saying, “I love what I do, but I’ve never liked being recognized or being in the spotlight.”His music earned him a pair of Grammy nominations, one for his work on David Guetta’s Sunshine and another in 2013 for Levels. In a 2013 interview, he told me these nominations were the proudest moments of his career. The freshness and crossover appeal of his sound also brought a line of superstars eager for EDM crossover plays to his door. He co-produced a track on Madonna’s 2015 LP Rebel Heart while Sky Full of Stars, a 2014 collaboration with Coldplay, was a worldwide radio hit.His own biggest smash was 2013’s Wake Me Up, a folk music crossover that was booed by the audience at Ultra when Avicii debuted it at the festival in 2013. No matter. Featuring singer Aloe Blacc, the urgently uplifting track hit No 1 in more than 40 countries and presciently tapped into the market potential of mixing EDM and country, a template many artists have since recreated. The song appeared on his 2013 solo debut album True, which hit the top 10 in more than 15 countries. But there were signs of wear and tear too. The tour schedule of the Avicii juggernaut was intense, with him hitting clubs and festivals on every continent except Antarctica and often playing two shows a night. Bergling cancelled his headlining set at Ultra 2014 in order to have emergency gallbladder and appendix surgery. (Deadmau5 stepped in to take his place.) A 2013 GQ profile captured the alcohol-soaked hedonism of his life as the boy king of EDM and found Bergling “subsisting on a diet of Red Bull, nicotine, and airport food”. (The article was widely slammed by Avicii fans, with Bergling himself calling it “truly unfair and incorrect”.) In 2014, the addiction rumors were substantiated when Avicii cancelled all of his scheduled concerts due to health problems. “In the beginning, I’d party a lot … every night was a party,” he told me in 2013. “But I just realized that for me personally, my body and mind couldn’t handle it any more.” He officially retired from performing live in 2016, at the age of 26. Two years later and Avicii’s publicist has announced that Bergling was found dead on the Arabian peninsula, thousands of miles from his home in Stockholm. “It is with profound sorrow that we announce the loss of Tim Bergling, also known as Avicii,” Diana Baron said in a statement. “He was found dead in Muscat, Oman this Friday afternoon local time, April 20th. The family is devastated and we ask everyone to please respect their need for privacy in this difficult time. No further statements will be given.”Mainstream popularity can often feel like ritual sacrifice, as we build people up only to stand captivated as they descend – into addiction, into turmoil, into avīci. Tim Bergling’s story has come to a tragic if not entirely unpredictable end, one at odds with the joy of the music he so expertly produced during his brief but influential moment at the top. It’s hard to mourn to a song like Levels that so adamantly denies the darkness. EDM is about joyful celebration in the face of conflict. Perhaps this was Bergling’s undoing. It is also his legacy.

And now there’s a new way to take it all in: in the US, the Record Store Crawl initiative has been set up to explore the wealth of stores in each city. With RSD looming, we thought this could be a model for a survey of the health of record shops in British cities: so, four writers have gone round four cities with some of the UK’s most exciting new DJs and producers, picking out their ultimate record-shopping routes.In London, Debi Ghose – aka Debonair – seems at home in Low Company. Not only is it her local spot, in Hackney Downs, but “their selection is really close what I play, I trust their curation”. Her club and radio sets tend towards the 1980s experimentalism of post-punk, EBM and early house. The chipboard and white walls of Low Company are decorated with 80s industrial music art, its sections are called things like “Strange  Dream  Avant”, and Kenny, the crop-haired Scotsman behind the counter, is playing unwell-sounding outsider punk in between nipping outside for rollups. The shop clearly revels in being on the margins. Not only is it not participating in Record Store Day, it had considered not even opening on the day as it’s the business’s first birthday the day before and they’ll all be hungover. Debi buys a ticket for the birthday party, laughing with Kenny about how many “reprobate” mutual friends will be there.In the quarter-hour it takes us to stroll into bustling Dalston, Debi details her record shop history. At school in Leamington Spa, she “wasn’t a rebel, did well, but got bored and needed something more to focus on”. As a teenage Smashing Pumpkins and Joy Division fan, the local Fopp Records “was heaven to me” at 15 she applied for a job there. She is endlessly thankful that the manager – a DJ known as The Lovely Helen, resident at Brum house institution Wobble – noted her enthusiasm and picked her over other (older, male, ostensibly more qualified) candidates. Behind the counter, she gained confidence talking about music, and expanded her own tastes dramatically: “I had disposable income and cheap records,” she laughs, “I bought so much!”We get to Eldica and are warmly greeted by Annie, who runs the place with her former rave producer husband Andy, and named it for her Trinidadian grandma. In contrast to Low Company’s austere hipness, it’s a piled-up Aladdin’s cave of second-hand vinyl, leaning heavily towards reggae, jazz and soul. “When I joined NTS Radio in 2011,” says Debi, referring to the taste-making online station, “it was great to have this place round the corner, as a connection to the older generation of music lovers already in Dalston. It’s a lovely spot, nothing’s overpriced, but you need three hours to properly dig here.”Sadly we don’t have that, as we need to get to Soho. After university, where she learned presenting and mixing on the uni radio station, Debi had a short stint working in an advertising agency. She was more interested in spending every lunchtime in Soho’s record shops, though, which didn’t go unnoticed: her leaving present from the agency was vouchers for Phonica. Phonica is now the West End’s main dance music hub constant house music plays as established DJs try out 12-inches at the listening posts, and Debi reels off great “in-stores” she’s seen here as her own DJ career began.Nick, who serves us, is a DJ too and runs the well-regarded Meda Fury label as Debi umms and ahhs over a Frankie Goes to Hollywood 12-inch, he shoves a fantastically weird new EP of Japanese electro-dub-folk songs and some Lyonnaise deep house into her listening pile, and passes me a moody electro 12-inch. He’s good: we buy all three, then walk a couple of minutes to Berwick Street, where Reckless hangs on in there, resisting gentrification, unlike most of that strip of secondhand-record shops. There’s no listening posts, only buying on spec, which Debi does often I snap up a Planet Mu acid house record going super cheap.It’s quite a schlep to southeast London with the rush hour starting. (We’re glad at this point that we left Notting Hill’s Honest Jon’s, and Debi’s very favourite shop, Alan’s in East Finchley, off our itinerary.) Sadly, Rat Records in Camberwell is closing as we arrive. So after briefly pressing our noses against the window like kids at a sweetshop, as Debi describes it – “just a really classic record shop, which was my regular place to go when I lived in Brixton” – we get a 171 bus five minutes down the road to Peckham.There’s no fear of Rye Wax being shut, mind. In the basement of Rye Lane’s vast Bussey Building – where grubby raving spaces sit alongside African churches, community groups and yoga studios – it’s also a bar and music venue, open late every night. A DJ is playing Latin jazz as we arrive. “It’s the perfect model of how a shop can be a real hub,” Debi says. “It’s not just a venue, but somewhere I’m guaranteed to meet other DJs and people I know.” Sure enough, it’s buzzing as Debi chats and browses, owner Tom tells me how they’re bypassing RSD releases and instead cutting their own single-copy dubplates. Once Debi has found an intriguing compilation of 80s Catalan DIY rarities, we settle down at a table for a drink, musing on what it must have been like for experimental Spanish musicians under Franco, and taking stock of our day. “It’s hard to know what will happen to record shops,” says Debi. “They’re never going to be what they were before downloading. But if they can turn into places like this, I’m happy!”“This is proper Bristol weather,” grins Omar McCutcheon, the latest star in the city’s long history of experimental dance music. The drizzle is unrelenting as we pace around the Stokes Croft area on our record store crawl, but even though it’s overcast, this cultural nerve centre vividly compensates. Lurid murals loom over the urban sprawl terraced houses are painted in fuschia and lavender. Every other shop is a quirky bar, vegan cafe or vintage clothing emporium. “You’re always getting creative stimulation in Bristol,” says McCutcheon.Under the moniker Batu, the 24-year-old is the next in a long line of Bristol musicians who create new forms from low-end frequencies: his mentors Pinch and Peverelist helped pioneer dubstep’s deep e into techno in the mid-2000s, followed by the latter’s cutting-edge collective Livity Sound, and now Batu has taken the baton and is veering off in an even more abstract direction. With his label and night Timedance, he pairs sound-system culture with techno to create sculptural club punishers that fizz with lambent ideas and curious samples, as do the young local artists he releases such as Bruce, Ploy, Lurka and Giant Swan.Idle Hands is the shop where the city’s new wave congregates. It’s a no-frills dance music specialist run by Chris Farrell, with well-curated racks of new 12-inches ning the UK underground. “It’s very important to me – a meeting spot, a hub of Bristol music,” says McCutcheon as he spots an old Bass Clef tune he’s been after for ages and locks straight into some headphones.Idle Hands is one of the new boutique record shops that have sprung up here in the past few years, after a wave of closures. Farrell says Record Store Day doesn’t make much of a difference to the shop in terms of sales, but because all the pressing plants are booked up with limited edition novelty items such as translucent green vinyl Doctor Who soundtracks, new stock doesn’t come through as readily in the weeks leading up to it. McCutcheon still finds a wedge of vinyl he wants, including a compilation of early experiments by Japanese musician Kuniyuki Takahashi, which recently came out on a leftfield label he admires, Music from Memory.McCutcheon is relatively new to the city, having moved here four years ago from Oxfordshire for the creative music technology course at Bath Spa University (“dubstep finishing school”, Farrell quips). His growing touring schedule means he doesn’t get as much time to shop locally as he’d like. Which may explain why we can’t seem to find next stop The Centre for Better Grooves. It was started by the founder of budget music chain Fopp but is, in contrast, “a wallet beater”, jokes McCutcheon. We pass Elevator Sound, a sleek shrine to modular synths, and bump into a postman who is by night a psychedelic DJ and points us in the right direction. Soon we are riffling through a luxurious number of jazz reissues with cosmic covers. Past a pair of congas, there’s a sizeable vintage rock section, but McCutcheon is less interested in that. “I’m more of a sound than a songs person,” he says, eyeing up a selection labelled “FX” that is ripe for sampling.Next we head to Wanted’s tiny record trailer, down a cobbled path in St Nick’s Market. McCutcheon immediately makes a beeline for the dancehall crates, and waxes lyrical over the Greensleeves Rhythm Album series, one of the longest-running of its kind, where various artists interpret the same rhythm. He has also recently been collecting reggae and dub 45s, the hub for which is Payback, around the corner. Paul Craine has been running this fir-green stall for 20 years and it’s where you can find Prince Buster 7-inches for £1, or more contemporary roots releases from Protoje or Chronixx. Payback is a window into the origins of Bristol’s obsession with making music so deep it can rattle your ribcage. The area’s African Caribbean sound-system heritage has laid the foundation for the subsequent genres of weighty, deep electronic music that have come through its streets: trip-hop, jungle, dubstep. For McCutcheon, that culture is also “integral to my identity. Living here, having family of Caribbean descent and growing up with reggae – all these ideas link back to where I see myself in the world.” No matter what record shop you’re in or producer you talk to, bass, says McCutcheon, is what unites the city: “It’s so ingrained in everything.”“Technooooo,” comes the jovial response from Henrietta Smith-Rolla when asked what section she gravitates towards in a record shop. “Always the techno section. I never go in with any idea of what I want to buy. I like not knowing.”Over coffee in Eastern Bloc, a cafe, venue and record shop in Manchester’s Northern Quarter, the hiss of the coffee machine whistles above the thudding techno pulsing from the speakers. “I’ve been doing music for over a decade but I didn’t know this was in me,” the 37-year-old says about Afrodeutsche, a project born two years ago whilst searching for her father. She learned that her Ghanaian roots also stretched into Russia and Germany, and thus found herself with a newfound identity and family history. The name, translating as African-German, was an epiphany that linked to the already eclectic music she was creating. “I just had this huge connection to it straight away. I never expected to realise myself artistically in this world.” Afrodeutsche blends techno, house, electro and anything else Smith-Rolla feels like throwing in, based on intuition. “Everything I write is always a translation of what’s going on with me. Even my NTS shows are just based on how I’m feeling,” she says, referring to her monthly radio show.As we walk upstairs and the throb of the beat grows louder, Smith-Rolla doesn’t nosee into the techno section but instead is greeted with a pile of 12-inches, recommended by Ben Marsden, the head house and techno buyer. This level of personal curation and assistance is crucial for smaller shops, he tells me. “I go in spurts of buying records,” Smith-Rolla says. “I’m not in shops all the time but when I am, I’m usually here.” She also buys online from places like Discogs and Boomkat. “I think record shops have got kinder,” she tells me, in-between playing Umwelt and Maelstrom on the listening turntable. “There’s been a change in how women are looked at and observed. There’s no surprise any more when a woman walks in to buy a Detroit techno record. I would get nervous going into shops when I was younger, but things have become more welcoming.”While the music of Afrodeutsche is deeply personal and emotional – she describes it as “dark optimism” – when Smith-Rolla DJs, it’s all about getting loose and dismantling the seriousness of some in the techno world. “I like to have fun. I don’t see myself as a DJ my sets are …” she stops mid-sentence and makes a series of explosive, chaotic noises. “As far as I’m concerned, anyone can do this. There isn’t a wall between us. There’s no bravado, it’s just fun times. Manchester is the kind of place that if you’re into good stuff then you’ll be invited to do good things it’s a small city and everyone is connected.” As we move around the corner onto Oldham Street on a bustling afternoon and into Piccadilly Records, Smith-Rolla shows her goofy side as I look over to see her doing the downward escalator routine, disappearing behind a rack of records, cackling away.Smith-Rolla lived in Devon and London before Manchester, and is positively glowing about her time here. “Manchester is a beautiful place because it is nurturing without question. It’s here where I felt I had complete freedom to make stuff.” This freedom to create has seen her work with 808 State’s Graham Massey, score a reinterpretation of the 1992 documentary Baraka, and become part of GRRRL, a group assembled by In Place of War, a project that works to mobilise and connect artists in conflict zones. The eight-piece, and their “insane, pure energy” live performance, recently played the Commonwealth Games’ closing ceremony.In Vinyl Exchange, she takes an armful of records to the counter. The man behind it sincerely asks how her music is going, telling her he’s heard good things about her live shows. On the way out, she reflects on this sense of community and support she finds in the record shops, clubs and people of Manchester: “I’m surrounded by encouragement. That’s what Manchester does, it makes you want to be involved and help people out.”Cratedigging and cardio may seem like two diametrically opposed pastimes but in Glasgow it is possible to combine both. Palais de Danse – a cramped but colourful garret stacked with preloved vinyl – lies behind a doorway on Sauchiehall Street. You just have to make it up four narrowing flights of stairs first. This is where Kenny Grieve and Dan Lurinsky of Dixon Avenue Basement Jams (DABJ) – local label owners and in-demand DJs – want to begin their Glasgow record shop crawl. Even on a miserable Friday morning, the elevated view from the fire escape makes it feel like an appropriate place to survey the city’s music retail scene, once we get our breath back. “Some workout, that,” Grieve says to Dennis, Palais de Danse’s wiry proprietor. “Try doing it with a box of records,” he replies, “it’s murder.” There are deep bins of house and techno, while a lone box of dubstep sits atop an ancient safe. Grieve and Lurinsky rifle through the stock with the flowing fingers of veteran vinyl spelunkers their eventual haul includes a hidden gem from Dave Clarke’s 90s techno imprint Magnetic North. Palais de Danse is one of a new wave of independent vinyl shops that have opened in Glasgow in the past three years. The next stop, Rubadub, is more of an institution: since 1992, it has been a hub for DJs looking to stock up on desirable new imports, upgrade equipment or just talk shop with fellow devotees. While some stores host a chaotic decor of ripped posters and countless club flyers, Rubadub has always been stripped-back, cool, clinical. A recent interior redesign has reinforced the monochrome look but retained the shop’s signature feature: a tightly-wound cast-iron spiral staircase leading up to a cluster of listening decks. Lurinsky is a longstanding Rubadub employee, and says practically all of the staff were – like him – regular customers first, drawn to the communal vibe. While the shop may not officially take part in Record Store Day (“I think most people feel it’s all got a bit commercial,” says Lurinsky) there will still be a day-long party on 21 April, to christen the refit. Next, we head south of the Clyde to visit Otherside, a narrow, seductive emporium that has offered both second-hand vinyl and eccentric vintage objects since 2015. JD Twitch, of Glasgow’s venerable Optimo club night, once offloaded so much excess vinyl here he had his own section it is perhaps the only place in the city where it is possible to pick up a happy hardcore classic from DJ Mental Theo and a Victorian carpet beater in the same trip. Having been invited to rummage through some unsorted stock, Lurinsky is elated to find a record by Detroit legend Claude Young he has coveted for years. Grieve somehow emerges with a hookah pipe and a chipped plaster statue of the Virgin Mary, decor for the new DABJ office-cum-studio by the riverside. Their label name was inspired by a raucous mid-2000s in-the-know after-hours party staged in a crudely converted basement flat on Dixon Avenue, and the final stop on our crawl is only a few streets away from that spiritual birthplace. Some Great Reward, a cosy cafe that doubles as a physical outpost for an online record store, opened earlier this month. In the main space, new releases like Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s Sex and Food are displayed on the wall with smart, snappy recommendation notes.

A few months later Paulette Wilson, a grandmother from Jamaica who had lived in Britain for 50 years, became the first of more than 20 Windrush migrants to tell the Guardian how they were facing deportation or a loss of rights to health, housing and work because of Home Office policy.The aggressive language and tone of Rudd’s approach to immigration enforcement emerged after the home secretary attempted to blame officials in her own department for the Windrush scandal in which it emerged up to 50,000 mostly Commonwealth migrants were facing possible deportation despite having lived in Britain for decades. Rudd claimed in parliament on Monday she was “concerned that the Home Office has become too concerned with policy and strategy and sometimes loses sight of the inidual”.That appeared to be an attempt to suggest she had inherited a hardline system from May, who as home secretary announced a policy to create “a really hostile environment for illegal migrants” across government departments.But in the private memo, Rudd said she believed in the fundamental importance of that hostile environment agenda, which she referred to as the “compliant environment”, an attempted rebranding of the policy by ministers a few months earlier.The culture that agenda inspired has been widely blamed for members of the Windrush-era generation being threatened in recent months with deportation and denied access to housing, healthcare and jobs.In 2016, 39,626 people were deported or left the UK voluntarily, according to the UK Migration Observatory, but Rudd’s letter to May indicates a home secretary determined to make her mark and toughen up even further an immigration enforcement regime which uses liveried vans that have become an increasingly common sight in areas with large migrant communities.Rudd told May her proposals to reduce the overall illegal population had been “informed by the review that you commissioned whilst home secretary”. She concluded: “Everything I have outlined above is aimed not just at radically reshaping and refocusing immigration enforcement but at increasing the public’s confidence in our immigration system.”Nowhere in the memo does Rudd mention the possible human cost of getting her immigration policy wrong.Rudd told May that her strategy was “informed by the review that you commissioned as home secretary”. On Thursday, Nick Clegg, who was deputy prime minister from 2010 to 2015, said May’s Home Office had pursued “nasty politics” over immigration.Rudd’s memo was sent as the government stepped up its attempts to bring net migration down into the tens of thousands. The previous year, the figure was 248,000. Four months earlier, May rebooted the government’s immigration taskforce, chairing a committee of 12 cabinet ministers – including the three key Brexit supporters, Liam Fox, Boris Johnson and David Davis – to ensure a new regime was introduced to slash the net number of arrivals into the UK to below 100,000 a year.Other measures she told May about included obtaining biometric data from countries such as Pakistan, which she said could be “a potential game changer in terms of the numbers we can remove”. She asked for the prime minister’s help to persuade the leaders of other countries to supply such data.Rudd also said she wanted illegal migrants who were being housed in detention centres before removal to either be sent back to their origin country, released into the community on licence, or tagged to free up beds for the new people that her immigration enforcement team will be picking up.A Home Office spokesperson said: “Illegal immigration impacts the whole of society, putting pressure on taxpayer-funded public services, leaving vulnerable people at the mercy of exploitative employers or landlords, and at worst, fuelling the abhorrent crimes of modern slavery and human trafficking.“People from the Windrush generation are of course here legally. The Home Secretary has recognised the huge contribution they have made to our society, and has apologised unreservedly to them. We are taking urgent action to help them to evidence their legal right to live in the UK, and have set up a dedicated taskforce to do so. “It is wilfully misleading to conflate the situation experienced by people from the Windrush generation with measures in place to tackle illegal immigration and protect the UK taxpayer. It is clearly essential that we continue to take action against people who are here illegally.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c6fc4fdb922afc97fea55dedca5f1a29bb5cf14/0_13_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=06f805a9f11900b878d4ed1131f303b0 1240w","title":"new power jeremy heimans social media","story":"Social media and online movements such as #MeToo are more potent than experts and elitist thinking, argue the authors of a manual on how to navigate the 21st century There is nothing out of the ordinary about a book that makes one angry. We have all read ones that provoke us, and the internet is an inexhaustible feast for anyone easily outraged. It is unusual, however, to read a book that makes one mad with oneself.The co-authors of New Power could not be more likable. Clever, witty and creative, Henry Timms and Jeremy Heimans are baby-faced wunderkinds of digital activism the type whose optimistic energy ought to make one feel hopeful for the future. So it is uncomfortable to confess that I hated almost every word, and wished more than anything for them to be wrong. The reason their book made me so cross with myself was that, if they are right, it means my way of thinking is old-fashioned and elitist – the very problem, in fact, they are trying to solve.New Power begins by contrasting a 20th-century model of power – “jealously guarded, closed, inaccessible and leader-driven”, typified by Harvey Weinstein – with a new 21st-century model – “open, participatory peer-driven”, exemplified by the #MeToo movement. No political or commercial organisation will survive, it argues, unless it abandons “old power values” of expertise, confidentiality, formal governance and managerialism, and adopts “new power values” of online crowd-sourcing, radical transparency, leaderless structures and amateurish enthusiasm. The future belongs to Airbnb and Black Lives Matter, in other words, and the book is a manual for us to learn how to be more like them.Heimans is Australian, but has just flown in from the US hours before we meet Timms is British, but based in New York, so takes part by phone. Heimans is 40, but looks as if he is in his early 20s, and we spend the first five minutes discussing his skin-care regime. He indulges my curiosity about moisturiser choices with self-deprecating humour, but small talk doesn’t feel like his natural register, and the purpose of the book is deadly serious. “The future,” it predicts, “will be won by those who can spread their ideas better, faster and more durably.” In 2018, as Heimans says, “It’s really hard not to make the argument that the forces of misinformation and extremism and nativism are in the lead.”He invites us to contrast the success of the new power recruitment strategy of Isis with the failure of the US state department’s old power effort to thwart it Isis recruits through a peer-to-peer network of youngsters sharing seductive intimacies on social media, which the state department sought to defeat with a calamitously ill-judged Twitter account bearing an image of its official seal and the instruction: “Think Again, Turn Away!”“This is really the reason why we wrote the book, and why we made the book quite practical,” Heimans says. “Because we want these tools to be in the hands of those on the side of the angels.” Timms agrees: “We’re going to need a lot of people – the scientists, the community organisers, the people who believe in enlightenment values – to embrace the new power tools and get really good at being powerful.” Their problem, of course, is that this target audience can be as sniffy about it as me.“Yes, there’s this emotional resistance,” Heimans reflects equably, trying, I think, to conceal his impatience with it. “There’s a complacency on the liberal side: ‘Why should we have to do this? Why should we get our hands dirty? Who needs a meme when you have a fact?’” That pretty much sums me up, I cheerfully admit. If others want to spend their time sharing amusing video clips on Twitter, they are welcome to, but why do I have to get involved? The question is semi-ironic his reply is arrestingly earnest.“The moral argument is, Decca, you care about these values that the newspaper you work for stands for, and we all have an obligation to learn these skills of building movements, spreading ideas, figuring out how to manage these communities.”The case he and Timms make for the superiority of social media-driven, open, mass participatory movements, loosely structured but cleverly engineered for loyalty, is unarguable. By deploying new power tactics, organisations as erse as Ted talks, Pope Francis’s Vatican and the National Rifle Association are thriving, whereas Uber – which treats its drivers with contempt – is in trouble. This doesn’t, however, alter my problem with the fact that the stunts that capture attention in the new power model are often toe-curlingly inane.Gormless frat-boy humour doesn’t, curiously, appear to trouble Heimans. He is a huge admirer of the Ice Bucket Challenge, which raised more than $115m (£82m) for charity in 2015. Then there is Reddit, whose highest-scoring post ever at one point was a message titled: “test post please ignore”, provoking what Heimans calls the “rebellious” instincts of the Reddit community, and others might call asinine. In 2016, the Natural Environment Research Council experimented with new power by launching a #NameOurShip social media campaign. When some bright spark proposed Boaty McBoatface, “the internet,” note Heimans and Timms, apparently amused, “of course agreed.” I am relieved when Heimans tells me he would not have voted for Boaty himself – but less so when he adds that he would have gone for the popular alternative option, “I Like Big Boats and I Cannot Lie”. Public subversion sabotaged the campaign because the NERC, the argument goes, was a new power amateur. Nevertheless, its decision to overrule the Boaty vote and call the ship the RSS David Attenborough instead was, Heimans maintains, a mistake.“You’ve got this really dull research vessel that no one would have paid any attention to, at a time when we’re trying to get people enthusiastic about science, at a time when the anti-science crowd is gaining potency. You could have had a crowd of people follow Boaty McBoatface on its journey. You could have had people help fund it. You could have had people engaged as citizen scientists. You could have created a whole community around that work that would have put people into the funnel of creating some intensity around science. Why wouldn’t you do that?”“Because it’s moronic!” I want to say – but am embarrassed by how stiff and snooty I sound. Heimans and Timms make me feel as if I have turned into Jacob Rees-Mogg. There is nothing snobbish about the next misgiving I raise. At the heart of every successful new power platform are what Heimans and Timms call “feedback loops” – reward systems of likes, shares and comments engineered to keep us coming back, craving the next dopamine hit of external validation. That this buzz is addictive is obvious the authors’ assertion that likes on Instagram “aren’t (just) ego boosts”, however, sounds laughably delusional. What other possible function can “Looking gorge, babe!!” serve? Has Timms, I joke, not seen Instagram?“We are not here to defend the culture of narcissistic selfies,” he says. “No. We want a healthcare system that works. We want a government that people actually like. We want an education system that gives people a sense of connection. The problem is most of those institutions were created in an old power context. They were built for the 20th century, and sometimes the 19th century, and so we have to start reimagining those institutions so that they don’t fail. You think about a millennial person whose life is full of these feedback loops – a lot of their life is mediated through these new power platforms, right. That’s what they want from their institutions now.”But the authors never mention the growing evidence of the psychological damage feedback loops are doing to young people’s mental health. If millennials are addicted to loops, of course they will want more – but if the relentless judging and ranking is making them ill, the state doesn’t have to oblige, does it?“I think mental health is a real concern,” Timms acknowledges. “But I think the really huge risk is the damage of distraction. We are all so engaged in our participation – but it distracts us from the things that matter. If feedback loops are only built around cat videos, that’s clearly a distraction. That’s clearly going to distract us from the things that matter the most.”Taxes, for example, matter. “They’re critical to any society. But as feedback loops go, the system does not perform particularly well. You essentially just give the government money, and have no real sense of where it ends up. Imagine a world where actually you’re getting much better feedback loops around your taxes, so you pay the taxes and you end up in a world where you find out where the money goes. Maybe you have some more power over how it’s spent. Maybe you hear about the impact along the way.”The possibility that anyone might not want this appears not to have crossed Timms’ mind. Personally, I don’t want a feedback loop with HMRC. But as I don’t want to share a meme, upload a video or name a boat either, to infer a contemporary trend from my preferences might be absurd. What is less clear, but more important, is whether Timms and Heimans’ temperamental bias similarly distorts their work on new power. Their authorial voice is reporterly, but the affectation of clear-eyed critical distance is misleading, for both are key protagonists in the new power movements they write about. It is hard, therefore, to know whether the power of the new power they report is objectively real, or just wishful thinking.The son of immigrants, by the age of 12 Heimans was already a precocious political pundit on national Australian TV. At 27, he founded a grassroots movement called GetUp!, which, according to their book, now has more members than every political party in Australia combined. He is also the founder and CEO of Purpose.org, an international activist organisation incubating political campaigns worldwide. Timms is the director of 92Y, a cultural centre in New York, and in 2012 founded a philanthropic movement called #GivingTuesday that brings new power tactics to the old challenge of fundraising. They are evangelical pioneers in the world they describe in their book, and I wonder whether this makes them more cheerleaders than observers.“We’re optimists,” Heimans concedes. “We do believe that there are inherent benefits to participation, if done well and smartly.” He would still have written exactly the same book, however, if he shared all my misgivings. “We’re very invested in getting this right, because we have to be, because the old world isn’t coming back. Like it or not, it’s just not coming back.”Both men see plenty of problems with the new world. Facebook comes out of their book very badly, accused of co-opting the rhetoric of new power while behaving more like the Kremlin. Writing long before the Cambridge Analytica revelations, they predict that “Participation farms”, which harvest our data for profit, will have to be tackled. Politicians such as Donald Trump, who deploy the power of social media for authoritarian ambitions, pose a grave danger, they warn, and leaderless new power movements such as Occupy can unravel into chaos. The Parkland students in Florida campaigning for gun control “get it,” Heimans says. “They know how to harness the energy of a connected crowd.” To succeed, however, they will need to partner with old power. Hashtags and marches won’t do it alone. “Our argument,” explains Heimans, “is not: ‘Throw away these old power skills that you’ve learned, the expertise, the understanding of how to navigate traditional organisational structures.’ We all still need those skills. The key is learning how and when to use old and new.”I think Timms might be trying to cheer me up when he agrees. “Elitists will still have a role. They will still be needed.” After all, he jokes, he had his appendix out a month ago. “And no one wants a group of hipster makers to crowdsource an appendectomy, right? No one wants that.”New Power by Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms is published by Macmillan, price £20. To order a copy for £17, go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

He had sold all his “clone” plants to other growers, who were using them to cultivate yet more marijuana.“You start doing the math on that and it just didn’t make sense how people could be growing that many plants,” Willison said.Fast-forward nearly a year and Oregon does indeed have a glut of marijuana there are over 1m lb of usable but unsold marijuana, according to the state tracking system. That’s more than 128m “eighths” of weed, and almost three times the amount of cannabis sold in Oregon in all of last year.Flooded with supply, prices are dropping so much that some dispensaries in the Portland area are selling the drug for $4 a gram. That’s less than half the cost of a bargain-basement batch in other US cities where marijuana is legal, like Denver and Seattle.When the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), the agency in charge of cannabis regulation, issued the first licenses to businesses in 2016, projections were for 800 to 1,200 businesses to obtain cannabis licenses in the first couple of years, according to Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the OLCC.But 1,824 marijuana-related business licenses have already been issued, including 981 production operations. Another 967 production licenses are in various stages of approval by the state and could come online later this year.Molly Conroy, the program director for the Oregon Cannabis Association, cautioned that this is a brand new market that needs time to adjust.“Every agricultural crop has its highs and its lows,” she said. “No pun intended.”Unlike Colorado, which also legalized marijuana, many of the cannabis farms in Oregon are outdoors because the plants thrive in the state’s warm, sunny summers. But the first year that recreational cannabis farms were licensed, a rainstorm hammered the crop just before the prime flower harvest in October.“A lot of crop got destroyed,” said Pettinger. “It wasn’t salvageable because it had mildew or mold on it. So there was a not a real accurate gauge of what the market looked like.”Demand remained high – so, by last fall, hundreds more farms had obtained licenses. And a long, favorable growing season made for a bumper crop. Suddenly, the state had more marijuana than it knew what to do with.Cannabis flowers have a shelf life of several months but after a while, the product gets stale. Andrew Lessar owns Oregon CO2, a company that extracts oils from cannabis flowers, then sells the oils to producers of edibles. Lessar said he gets between five and 10 calls a week from growers who are desperate to generate some income from their flowers.“If I see an unknown number on my phone, I know it’s going to be someone saying, ‘We’ve got 500 lb,’ ‘We’ve got 2,000 lb … Can you help us?’”But Lessar said that because of the way cannabis is regulated, he can’t sell the oils back to the producer. They need to already have a buyer lined up or obtain a $5,000 license that covers a different part of the farm-to-consumer process.And because US federal law still prohibits cannabis, Oregon growers cannot legally sell outside the state’s borders.Tristan Reisfar works part-time for a company, High Desert Pure, that produces vapor cartridges and said he fields phone calls from desperate growers offering to sell their marijuana for as little as $100 per lb. When Oregon launched its recreational marijuana program, it was common for growers to count on bringing in $2,400 per lb.“We’re coming into another growing season here, what are they going to do then?” Reisfar asked.Reisfar also co-hosts a weekly marijuana-themed talk radio show called The High Desert Co-op. He said he gets calls every week from growers who are looking to sell their cannabis farms and want his promotional help.Willison, the co-owner of Eugenius LLC, said he still has “a couple hundred lb of product in our vault”.He has pared down his operation from 16 employees to seven. Three-quarters of the farm has been switched from cannabis to hemp seed. Hemp is a related plant that doesn’t offer the same high as cannabis, but has a variety of uses including fabric and medicine. He plans to keep growing marijuana to maintain his brand until the market rebounds. In the meantime, he estimates that the marijuana portion of his business is losing between $5,000 and $10,000 a month.“This glut’s going to take a few years. There is really no short-term answer,” Willison said.So what’s to come of that 1m lb of weed? Reisfar said that as cannabis flowers age, some of the chemical components that cause a narcotic high break down into slightly different components which instead cause drowsiness.“That’s another factor in their desperation,” he said of the growers. “That weed is turning into something that they didn’t start out trying to make: sleepy time weed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e1080c7f559da69ffa361ee75f239707b7a304c/0_278_6343_3805/master/6343.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a00180dd9011f9eefc919a72e4f0dd2b 1240w","title":"paula radcliffe predicts marathon classic end of record","story":"• Radcliffe has held world women’s marathon record for 15 years• Mary Keitany and Tirunesh Dibaba will have male pacemakersPaula Radcliffe has conceded her world marathon record is under real threat in Sunday’s London race but says Mary Keitany and Tirunesh Dibaba may blow their chances by taking each other on too early in the contest.Radcliffe’s time of 2hr 15min 25sec, set with the aid of male pacemakers, has stood unchallenged since 2003. But having run 2:17:01 in a women’s-only race last year – the second fastest time ever – Keitany believes that having male pacemakers this time will enable her to chase down Radcliffe’s record.Dibaba is also said to be in fantastic form, leaving Radcliffe wondering whether her longstanding record might finally go. “The way Mary ran last year I thought for a long time it was under threat,” she said.“So I think she is capable. But first and foremost she needs to concentrate on winning, because Tirunesh is highly capable too. But the record is very much down to how things are like on the day. You need good conditions, to have done the training and a bit of luck.”Radcliffe admitted that a part of her would be “sad” if it was finally to go. “The longer it has gone on, the more I have become attached to it,” she added. “It has almost become part of the family. Did I think it would stand this long? Probably not. Do I want it to be beaten? No, but I can’t do anything about it. I can’t go out and reclaim it now.”She also predicted a race for the ages – with Keitany establishing an early lead and Dibaba trying to reel her in. “Mary is going to go out and take the race by the scruff of the neck, while Tirunesh is far more likely to hold back until the second half of the race and see what she can do. Maybe that is the smarter tactic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00a84be3759a11a2d04d04698622e3404b8ab815/0_427_4152_2492/master/4152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=08e72b79399d096fc763cae88a7c86eb 1240w","title":"rugby union leinster munster james ryan racing 92 scarlets","story":"• Young lock aims to stay unbeaten in Saturday’s Scarlets semi• Keith Earls back from injury for Munster’s game with Racing 92It bears repeating that James Ryan, the Leinster and Ireland lock, is yet to lose a senior first-team match for club or country. It is now 19 and counting for the 21-year-old who began the season with more Ireland caps than Leinster appearances, and may finish it with a grand slam, Pro14 title and a Champions Cup winners medal.Ryan is part of the crop of Irish youngsters emerging from age-grade level tailor-made for the big stage. Not all have his impeccable record but they do not experience defeat often and, having swept all before them in the pool stages and overpowered Saracens in the last eight, Leinster face Scarlets in Saturday’s semi-final as the favourites, not least because it takes place at the Aviva Stadium, their second home.Ryan has dismissed any suggestions he is a lucky charm but considering he attended all three of Leinster’s European Cup final wins – in 2009, 2011 and 2012 – as a supporter, there is a sizeable body of evidence to the contrary. “We’re lucky at Leinster at the moment in that there are a lot of lads coming through, it’s all over the country,” said Ryan. “It’s very positive to have the younger lads coming through to push the older heads. There’s a lot of work being done at the moment on the schools game and the club game, a lot of people put a lot of time into that.”Much has been made of their “home advantage” – the Scarlets centre Scott Williams described it as “not exactly a neutral venue, it’s basically Leinster’s home ground” – and while Ryan acknowledges it works in his side’s favour, he knows better than to look towards Bilbao and a potential showdown against Munster in what would be a further demonstration of Irish rugby’s current might.After the two-times defending champions Saracens were knocked out, English involvement is conspicuous by its absence but the flag is flown by Stuart Lancaster, whose renaissance since carrying the can for the 2015 World Cup debacle continues apace. “He’s had a big influence on the squad,” added Ryan. “He likes us to express ourselves and play that ball-in-hand Leinster rugby. He wants us to show people what we can do and what we’ve got. He encourages us to back ourselves and when it’s on to have a go. He tells us to go for it.”Robbie Henshaw returns for Leinster but the New Zealand wing James Lowe is omitted because of restrictions on non-European players. For the Scarlets, Rhys Patchell lines up at full-back with Leigh Halfpenny on the wing and Dan Jones named at fly-half.Munster, meanwhile, face Racing 92 in Bordeaux after both teams emerged from the same pool, each winning their home matches against the other. Munster, who were beaten in the semi-finals last year and who last reached the final in 2008, welcome back Keith Earls from a knee injury. Simon Zebo, who joins Racing next season, is on the bench while Dan Carter also has to make do with a place among the replacements for the French side with Pat Lambie preferred at fly-half."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ffd4db67f2696106bb5f5a5e73aa07e4278debf/0_206_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=b54160b454bb9ed21b8b9af97d3b3f35 1240w","title":"talking horses scottish grand national ayr gordon elliott horse racing tips","story":"After winners in the 2018 Grand National and Irish equivalent, Gordon Elliott could make history in the Scottish raceGordon Elliott, having saddled the winners of the Grand National and the Irish equivalent in the past fortnight, is poised to achieve an unprecedented treble with Fagan (4.05) in the Scottish Grand National at Ayr. This looks a long-term plan for the grey, a horse who loves a sound surface and is owned by a Scotsman, Ronnie Bartlett.Two years ago Fagan finished best of all to be second in the Albert Bartlett Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, despite having started at 33-1. He has been lightly raced since then but his second place to Black Corton in October looks a lot better than it did at the time. With Davy Russell to nurse him through this, he can show himself to be the latest fine staying chaser based with Elliott.1.45 Ayr Carrying the same colours as Fagan, Dandridge is based with Arthur Moore and is a talented two-mile chaser at his best, having twice made the first four in the Grand Annual. He has dropped to a good mark, has had a wind op and now gets cheekpieces. This looks winnable.2.00 Newbury Roger Varian has been hitting the bar a lot but hopefully Defoe is ready to go, because this is a straightforward opportunity for a horse whose only defeat last year was in the Leger.2.20 Ayr Lightly raced in recent months, Dingo Dollar gets the ground he likes and can bag his third handicap chase in a row.2.35 Newbury Gavota might need this, so Dance Diva could be worth a shot, having shown plenty of talent in the first half of last season.2.55 Ayr Tom Lacey’s stable is on the run of a lifetime and his Flashing Glance could be the one here, having won tidily last month on his first start since wind surgery.3.10 Newbury From a yard that has yet to have a winner in 2018, Expert Eye is opposable at these odds.

It’s emblematic of the data protection issues Facebook is struggling to address in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, of the fact that these problems spread far beyond Facebook, and of the easy solutions the company could take if only it had the courage.This list is the collection of “advertisers you’ve interacted with”. You can find it halfway down your ad preferences screen, below a list of algorithmically suggested topics that Facebook thinks you’re interested in (if you’re a heavy user, these may be scarily accurate if you’re not, they’ll likely be hilariously off).A layperson may think the list of advertisers you’ve interacted with contains… advertisers you’ve interacted with. And some sub-sections do. The tab “whose website or app you’ve used” is self-explanatory – if you’ve logged in to a website or app through Facebook, well, that company knows who you are and can now advertise to you. The same is true if you visit a website that has Facebook’s tracking pixel on it (the “who you’ve visited” list) or, most obviously, if you’ve already clicked on an ad before (“whose ads you’ve clicked”).But the largest list is titled “who have added their contact list to Facebook”. And for me it’s a long list of companies you have never done business with, interacted with – or even knew existed.My list – on a placeholder Facebook account with no friends, created using an email address I don’t hand out for mailing lists – contained almost 200 advertisers, including an Italian restaurant in Perth, Australia a waffle shop in Charlottenburg, Germany and a surf cafe in Dubai.Facebook’s explanation for the list is simple enough: “These advertisers are running ads using a contact list they uploaded that includes your contact information,” the company tells users. “This information was collected by the advertiser, likely after you shared your email address with them or another business they’ve partnered with.” Advertisers are not allowed to simply buy a list of email addresses and upload them, or harvest them from the internet and sign people up to their mailing lists without consent. That is not only against most nations’ data protection laws, it is also against Facebook’s terms of service, which require that advertisers “have provided appropriate notice to and secured any necessary consent from the data subjects”.Yet those terms of service have not stopped just that from happening. The lure of extending your targeted advertising just a little bit further is just too strong. Shady data brokers will happily sell you a list of email addresses perfectly profiled for your restaurant to advertise to, and if you do not want to pay, well you can just jump on the dark web and download millions from one of the large dumps made public over the past decade.That’s not to say I am powerless. Facebook provides me with the ability to opt out of advertising from those companies, just by clicking a cross in the corner. All I need to do is devote some time to clicking a small button 174 times in a row and I am free from those companies – at least until the next 174 decide to upload my information.What I cannot do is anything with real power. I cannot tell Facebook that the vast majority of these companies cannot possibly have acquired my email address legitimately I cannot opt out of them all at once, defenestrating advertisers in their masses with a single click and I certainly cannot request that no company be able to target me simply by uploading an easily guessable address to the site.When it rolled out its new privacy policies in advance of GDPR, Facebook stood fast against some observers who believe complying with the law requires offering the option to opt out of targeted advertising altogether. Instead, the company took a slimmed-down approach, allowing users to limit the kinds of data that advertisers can target with, but insisting that targeting overall was fine. It may still be. But I’m not sure many users will take a look at the state of targeted advertising today, as reflected on their own Facebook settings pages, and conclude that everything is working as it should."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aed0139014c92ba1d252eabc322bd96e5626296/126_0_3091_1855/master/3091.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4ee9aa8135db3ac0e6daec0b6efc15e3 1240w","title":"the button review bbc1 gameshow","story":"In BBC1’s lighthearted new gameshow, the contestants participate from the comfort of their own living rooms The Button is a box that talks and has a big button on top, like a primitive version of Amazon Echo or Google Home. It might arrive in your family home a sure sign is if your family home suddenly becomes framed in pulsating neon.When the button turns from green to red you have to hit it, and it will set your family a challenge – make a tower out of books, tins and pillows that is taller than you are, or recite the alphabet backwards missing out the vowels. Something like that. And if you complete your challenge successfully and faster than the other four families who are also taking part, then you win points, which could translate to actual money at the end of the show. It’s a gameshow, then, in which the contestants, like the viewers, don’t leave their own living rooms. OK, they might have to go into another room to find books, or forks, or to open the front door to find what’s been left there. (A ping pong ball, perhaps, that has to be bounced into a cup, or lots of inflatable things that need to be squeezed into your house – the show is certainly impressive logistically.) But they’re at home, Gogglebox style. The Button is the host and the judge. It has the voice of and was co-created by comedian Alex Horne, who you may also know as the creator and co-host of Dave panel show Taskmaster. There’s more than a hint of that too, in the tasks, though this is more of a family thing.In this opener, the McCulloughs in Streatham are up against the Halls in Pontypridd and the Marchants in Castleford, which doesn’t really seem fair as there are more Halls than there are McCulloughs and the kids are bigger, which makes pushing inflatable objects into the house easier. It doesn’t really matter though – it’s not about fair, it’s about having a bit of laugh. And they’re all pretty rubbish at it. No one completes the tower task, mainly because of a sad lack of books (“Why don’t we read more?” shouts someone), which are better for building towers than pillows. It is a bit of laugh. A silly, family one. Not as much of a laugh as Gogglebox, but that’s about casting, and because eavesdropping is more interesting than watching people rush around gathering forks. Unless you’re a kid. Kids will probably like this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ab15adba8a3b43dbac1b01e8b9d77db2da4b328/0_9_1654_992/master/1654.jpg?w=1500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=789338680414b57ed226a3cae5d2548b 3000w","title":"why is modern tv so confusing","story":"Transmission failure: your guide to TV’s most complicated showsMarcella is an ITV crime drama with a titular cop whose dark personal life gives her a unique insight into her investigations, just like every other titular cop in every other ITV crime drama since the beginning of the universe. Yet viewers expecting a cosy cop show were left unnerved by the final episode of the second series, which aired earlier this month, in which Marcella visits a hypnotherapist to reveal she killed her own daughter and takes a blade to her own face to give herself a Chelsea smile. Unrecognisable, she begins a life living on the streets. Before the hour is up, though, DNA evidence has been used to mark her legally dead so that she can return to the force as an undercover agent.If you find that all a bit far-fetched (like one viewer who tweeted “can someone please explain that whole ending to me? None of the characters’ backstories were tied up and instead she’s now the joker?! Eh!!?”) , you’re probably not ready for the direction telly is heading in. In the last few years, the most hyped TV shows, such as Twin Peaks, have dispensed with linear storytelling, instead creating meta-worlds where normal characters deal with strange occurrences and jumbled timelines. It’s almost as if these shows deliberately try to disorientate audiences.Westworld, the HBO hit nominated for 22 Emmys and returning for a second season this week, confused viewers by creating a series of robots whose lives exist on a loop, meaning storylines taking place over decades could appear sequentially, tricking the viewer. The ability to swap bodies in the Marvel series Legion, meanwhile, means you never know whether the characters you’re watching are really themselves. In this new generation of shows, seemingly normal people are constantly interrogating the realities they find themselves in, unsure whether they are experiencing magic or just the side-effects of trauma, psychosis or AI.This is all happening at a time when our ability to judge what is true or fake in the real world is becoming ever more difficult. “In this particular moment with Brexit and Trump a lot of our notions of reality really are being disrupted,” says Dr Helen Marshall, who teaches a masters in science fiction and fantasy at Anglia Ruskin University. “Television shows like Black Mirror, which are projecting into the future but not very far – the kinds of world they’re throwing up seem increasingly plausible. TV can be both escapist but can also be a way of thinking about what reality is and how reality gets constructed. I think we’re really into those questions right now.”So while there are lots of reasons we’re getting more shows this odd, there remains a question as to whether weirder is better. Some viewers resent the fact that most of these shows demand viewers spend time reading online episode recaps and fan theories just to understand what’s going on. When the first season of Westworld ended, for example, there was a notable backlash from critics who thought that, in all its twists and trickery, the show had failed to tell us anything about humanity and consciousness. One particularly scathing review, entitled Westworld Is Bullshit, challenged the whole notion that complexity equals ingenuity.“I know that a lot of people genuinely enjoy the kind of show that pretty much demands viewers go online after an episode to figure out what the hell is going on,” says its author, Village Voice TV critic Lara Zarum. “I feel like the success of the first season of True Detective and the cottage industry of explainer pieces that sprang up around it has something to do with the proliferation of these kinds of shows. I also think TV creators are feeling more pressure to stand out in a crowded field, and a plot-heavy show, if it’s successful, kind of guarantees coverage in entertainment blogs. If you need to do extra homework after watching a show, it hasn’t done its job. I found Westworld more interesting to think about than enjoyable to watch.”That has always been the issue of complex TV. If things are too straightforward, savvy audiences will guess the ending before it happens. If they’re too complicated then watching starts to feel like a second job, especially when shows prioritise plot twists and conceptualism over likable characters and good scripts. But perhaps it’s outdated to think that TV should be entertaining. The concept of the serious novel or experimental cinema is accepted. Maybe it’s time we acknowledged there are some shows you watch for simple escapism, and others you have to work for.What’s it based on?There are no six words in the English language that send a chill down my spine more than “Adapted from a Neil Gaiman novel”. I know his tribe of fans (long-haired 6 Music listeners who moved to a small town in their 30s – “It’s quiet but there’s a fantastic selection of ales”) are devout, but there is something about his brand of thinking man’s fantasy that makes me want to burn down the nearest Forbidden Planet.Is it watchable?Only if you’re the sort of person who would enjoy being trapped at a party with someone trying to tell you why The Matrix got them into philosophy. The worst thing about this show is just how clever it thinks it is, leading to lots of overblown soliloquies. In the opening episode, for example, “technical boy”, the god of technology, rants that “language is a virus, religion is an operating system, prayers are spam”. With scripts like this – temporal shifts, shape-shifting gods, sex scenes where a goddess shags people until they are sucked entirely inside her – you can see his point about language.What’s it based on?The 1973 science-fiction film Westworld about a futuristic western-themed theme park where humans can have sex with and murder incredibly lifelike robots. Also Jurassic Park a bit. And also Boston Dynamics.Is it watchable? Westworld sets the scene for lots of big questions about the nature of consciousness and artificial intelligence, and although they do eventually get answered, there are hours and hours of cowboy nonsense to get through in between. The fact that some of the characters are human-like droids doesn’t make endless shoot ’em-ups and rape scenes any more watchable. Still, the trailer for season two suggests a more fast-paced affair, with the “hosts” rising up to conquer humanity. Perhaps as the robots begin to learn more about the basics of human emotion, some of the show’s writers will as well.Like a Facebook algorithm or John Humphries, Westworld is obviously very clever yet fundamentally unlikable.What’s it based on?X-Men, though thankfully you don’t need to know anything about the Marvel universe to enjoy this show. The main character, David, is the product of an affair Charles Xavier had with a former catatonic Holocaust survivor who was his patient on a visit to Israel. Sounds like a fun trip.Is it watchable?The central premise of Legion – “what if the voices in your head were real” – initially seems as if it’s going to be a more problematic reboot of Mel Gibson’s What Women Want, but the show that emerges is actually rather beautiful. David’s telekinetic powers creating some stunning kitchen explosions, plus Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords plays Oliver, a jazz-loving beat poet who lives in a block of ice that looks as if it was interior-designed by Austin Powers. The show provides an impressionistic visual realisation of the processes of therapy and treatment that is far more engaging than most po-faced approaches to these topics. Still, there’s literally no way to watch Legion without five tabs open to different online explainers.What’s it based on?An original concept by Brit Marling and her long-term creative partner Zal Batmanglij. They spent two years writing the story, mostly retelling the entire series orally to one another and refining details as they went. Once the show was commissioned Marling did a Frank Underwood and cast herself in the title role. Is it watchable?It must be said that all these shows, despite their supposed weirdness, are very fond of the same tropes. Sliding violin frets, gratuitous sex and violence, characters having dreams or visions that always, always end with them waking up with a nosebleed. The OA has every one of those tropes and more, yet it feels more muted than some other weird fiction shows. There is an insularity to it, filmed shakily, in small houses, on grubby carpets. The show feels like a genuinely arthouse take on the space between life and death, and the most likely heir to Twin Peaks’s weird, wonderful crown. Interpretive dance has never been so crucial to a plot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb1fbedffd3356f9f2f52aecb789cd44f3dee033/114_114_2527_1516/master/2527.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=17bb14a25a989bce21ae82fccc58cd10 1240w","title":"eight convicted in italy over secret mafia negotiations","story":"Five-year case has thrown light on one of the murkiest chapter’s in Italy’s recent historyA court in Italy has convicted eight men, including mob bosses, police investigators and a close associate of Silvio Berlusconi, over a secret attempt to negotiate with the Sicilian mafia in order to end a bloody bombing campaign in the 1990sAfter the verdict, members of the public cheered the prosecutors. Eight men were handed jail sentences ranging from eight to 28 years, including three former heads of the security police department – Mario Mori, Giuseppe De Donno and Antonio Subranni – and the co-founder of Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party, Marcello Dell’Utri.The five-year case has thrown light on one of the murkiest chapter’s in Italy’s recent history: secret talks held between who were seeking to overturn harsh anti-mafia laws. As part of their campaign to put pressure on the state, the mafia – at the time led by the Corleone family – unleashed a string of bombs and assassinations which killed 23 people including anti-mafia prosecutors Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino.“As judges were being blown up, some people in the state helped the cosa nostra,” said prosecutor Nino Di Matteo after the sentence. “This is is an historic ruling.”Di Matteo said the verdict proved that Dell’Utri was the go-between linking the mafia and the new Berlusconi government in May 1994. “The relationship didn’t stop with Berlusconi, the entrepreneur, but arrived at Berlusconi, the politician,” he said.According to the prosecutors, the Italian officials communicated with mafia “godfather” Totò Riina, who died in prison last November, in the attempt to stop the wave of mafia murders and bombings.During the contacts with state officials, mafia bosses offered to stop the bombings in return for reduced sentences for jailed mobsters and a review of all convictions.  Dell’Utri was sentenced to 12 years in prison for undermining the state, as were two retired paramilitary police generals and an ex-colonel. Dell’Utri is already serving a seven-year sentence for tax fraud, false accounting and acts of conspiracy with the Sicilian mafia.A convicted killer for the Corleone mafia family, Leoluca Bagarella, was handed 28 years and Antonio Cina, another high-ranking Corleone mobster, got 12 years. Both are already in prison. The Corleone bosses of that period, Salvatore “Toto” Riina and Bernardo “the Tractor” Provenzano, are dead.

Lawyers for Mizzi said the application, made by members of the Nationalist party, “expose the political partisan motives of the allegations against him”. “Dr Mizzi will defend his rights to the fullest extent permitted by law,” they added.The application was prompted by reports the FIAU had found that payments totalling €1.3m (£1.14m) were made into a shell company in Dubai. The company, called 17 Black, was described as one of the “target clients” for two Panama entities of which Schembri and Mizzi were beneficiaries. The MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil said the two men should step down. “The longer they continue running the country the deeper our country’s reputation will sink,” he said.Filed by Busuttil and the Maltese MEP David Casa, the court application states: “The inquiring magistrate is in a position to determine the full truth … and the case to do so if even more compelling considering that the persons involved are the right hand of the Maltese prime minister and the minister of energy.”A 120-page draft report by the FIAU sets out evidence that 17 Black received payments from a contractor engaged to work on a flagship energy project, and a company owned by a businessman from Azerbaijan.The owner of the Dubai company is unknown, and it appears to have no trading activity. Emails obtained by the investigators showed correspondence between representatives for Mizzi, who was energy minister at the time, saying that 17 Black was to be one of the “target clients” of a Panama company of which he was the beneficiary.Responding to the allegations, a spokesman for Mizzi said his Panama company – created after he entered office – was wound up without ever having traded. It never held a bank account and had been settled into a trust, which was established for the benefit of his family. He said there was “no connection” between Mizzi and the Dubai company.Schembri, who is the owner of printing and recycling businesses founded before he became an employee of the government, stated this week that 17 Black had been included in “draft business plans” for his group as a potential client, but that in the event no transactions were ever recorded with the company. Schembri said he had “no knowledge of the transfers referred to, nor any knowledge of the alleged payment”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af98407de24f229504932e19e9a4d26b1b32f2c7/0_117_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af11cee0b817c1ea033b400988573a29 1240w","title":"mexico congress politician legal immunity vote","story":"The vote to remove politicians’ immunity is meant to curb corruption and lessen perceptions Mexico’s political class can act above the lawMexico’s lower house of Congress has voted to remove politicians’ immunity from prosecution, a move meant to curb corruption and impunity and lessen perceptions the country’s political class can act above the law.Under the constitutional changes approved late on Thursday, the country’s president – who can currently only be impeached for treason and “serious crimes of the common order” – could be put on criminal trial while in office, but only after a vote in congress. “This bill will put an end to the impunity that prevails in Mexico’s political circles,” congressman Jesús Álvarez López of the leftist Morena party told AP. Politicians from all sides were quick to claim credit for the changes – which have long been pushed by parties while in opposition but blocked by the party in power.Politicians’ immunity from prosecution helped fuel perceptions that some sought election as a way of staying one step ahead of the law. Over the past decade, several politicians with accusations of corruption against them or supposed ties to drug cartels have hid out in congress, hoping to swear their oath of office and emerge untouchable.The bill was approved as Mexico readies for July presidential elections in which corruption has emerged as a central theme.The ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has been badly hit by corruption allegations, and even elected a non-member as its candidate – former finance minister José Antonio Meade – in an attempt to clean up its image.But Meade has struggled to connect with voters, and one poll this week showed him trailing leftwing populist candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador by 30 points. A string of PRI state governors have been caught up in graft allegations and several are in prison awaiting trial. Tomás Yarrington, former governor of Tamaulipas state on the Texas border from 1999 to 2005, was extradited on Friday from Italy to the United States. Yarrington denies accusations of cartel money laundering.However, some observers remain skeptical that stripping politicians of their immunity will prompt any real change in the country’s political culture. “If you look at the politicians imprisoned in Mexico, they’re the product of political vendettas or the settling of scores, rather than acts of the justice system,” said Aldo Muñoz Armenta, a political science professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State. “As long as the prosecutor or investigators obey the president or governors, they’re not going to open an investigation into them so long as it’s not politically convenient.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c18f1a57ae333a17bca9228dea5502260352320/0_125_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3811344514d4a1e5ac58fe63c5875d98 1240w","title":"north korea suspends nuclear missile tests","story":"North Korea has said it will end its tests of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and shut down its nuclear test site, in a dramatic development ahead of a much-anticipated meeting between its leader, Kim Jong-un, and Donald Trump.The suspensions went into immediate effect on Saturday, according to state-run KCNA news agency.The US president greeted the news in a tweet: “This is very good news for North Korea and the World – big progress!”The news comes less than a week before Kim meets the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, for a summit in the demilitarised zone that ides the peninsula.South Korea’s presidential office welcomed the announcement as “meaningful progress” towards denuclearisation. “It will create a very positive environment for the success of the upcoming inter-Korean and North-US summits,” said a statement.The move goes some way towards meeting US demands for denuclearisation, as Pyongyang and Washington work towards agreement on when and where Kim will meet Trump for historic talks that barely seemed possible just a few months ago.KCNA quoted Kim as saying that North Korea should focus on economic development now that it had achieved its aim of becoming a nuclear state. “The whole party and the whole nation should now focus on the development of the socialist economy,” he was quoted as saying. “This is the party’s new strategic policy line.”He added: “A fresh climate of detente and peace is being created on the Korean peninsula and the region, and dramatic changes are being made in the international political landscape.”The decision to suspend nuclear tests and missile launches came at a plenary meeting of the ruling party’s central committee, which had convened on Friday to discuss a “new stage” of policies – prompting speculation that the regime would move towards denuclearisation.Kim told the meeting that the North’s development of nuclear weapons should be seen as a “great victory”. “As the weaponisation of nuclear weapons has been verified, it is not necessary for us to conduct any more nuclear tests or test launches of mid- and long-range missiles or ICBMs. The northern nuclear test site has completed its mission,” he added, according to KCNA.North Korea has conducted all six of its nuclear tests at Punggye-ri test site in the country’s north-east. It tested its first nuclear weapon in 2006, while its last and most powerful test came last September.Those tests, plus a string of missile launches ordered by Kim throughout 2017, at one point appeared to be taking the peninsula to the brink of conflict.Some analysts greeted the North’s move with caution, noting that the regime had reneged on previous nuclear deals and that Saturday’s announcement did not mention shorter-range ballistic missiles capable of striking Japan and South Korea.Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, cautiously welcomed North Korea’s pledge. “We welcome it as a forward-looking move … but an important thing is whether the move will lead to the complete abandonment of missile and nuclear developments in a verifiable and irreversible manner,” Abe said. “We want to watch it closely.”The Japanese defence minister, Itsunori Onodera, said he and the US defence secretary, Jim Mattis, had agreed during talks in Washington that any deal must include weapons with which North Korea could continue to threaten its neighbours. “This is not the time for Japan, the United States and the international community to ease pressure” on North Korea, Onodera said.Catherine Dill, a senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, said a promise to end missile and nuclear tests “does not equate to the dismantlement of the nuclear and missile programmes”.Dill added: “Perhaps this signals that North Korea is confident enough in its nuclear and missile programmes to concede testing while stringing along the prospect of verifiable dismantlement for years past Trump’s presidency.“Verification is a complex, intricate process that requires much more negotiation and much more trust than is present at the moment. At this point, while I am optimistic, we must remember that North Korea can easily reverse course.”Scott LaFoy, a Washington-based satellite imagery analyst focusing on ballistic missile and space technologies, said Kim’s comments should be seen as “the first part of a negotiation. It can be easily undone, but could also turn into the foundation of a deal. It shouldn’t be read as a concrete promise, it should be seen as the start of a complex discussion.“This is a very positive first step towards arms control and maybe eventual denuclearisation. But, like with all positive first steps we’ve had in North Korea negotiations, it can still very easily reverse.”The North’s quest to develop a deterrent against what it has long described as US hostility resulted in an extraordinary exchange of insults between Kim and Trump last September, and frequent warnings from Washington that it would not rule out military action to end Kim’s nuclear ambitions.Saturday’s announcement came the day after a hotline between Kim and the South Korean president went live. The hotline connects Moon’s desk at the presidential Blue House with North Korea’s state affairs commission, which is headed by Kim, Yonhap news agency said.Earlier this week Moon, a liberal whose election in May raised hopes of an inter-Korea detente, said that Pyongyang had expressed a desire for the “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula without attaching preconditions such as the withdrawal of US troops.The two countries are due to hold a summit next Friday on the southern side of the demilitarised zone.The meeting is to be followed in May or June by a meeting between Kim and Trump. The US president on Wednesday pledged to meet Kim “in the coming weeks” but said he was prepared to walk away if the talks were not fruitful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ca3f53424140d62c2fde6591192789eef2c1279/0_178_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=6f87c1113643bba8e4f01bb9592d95ce 2600w","title":"cuba raul castro miguel diaz canel","story":"The island is getting a new president in Miguel Díaz-Canel – but the hands on the levers of power will remain the sameAs pundits around the globe proclaimed the end of the Castro era this week, Cuba’s new president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, promptly dismissed such a notion. “Raúl Castro … will lead the decisions of greatest transcendence for the present and the future of this country,” said Díaz-Canel in a speech marking the official changing of the guard on Thursday.After a 12-year run, Castro, 86, stepped down as president of the Cuban council of state and council of ministers, but he is not leaving the seat of power: he will remain the head of Cuba’s two most powerful institutions – the armed forces and the Communist party.Think of it as chess move: from center stage to backstage, – always Raúl’s comfort zone – from where he will vigilantly watch the proceedings.Unlike his brother Fidel, the Maximum Leader who craved the world stage, Raúl Castro was always a reluctant leading man. But as the founder and head of the Revolutionary Cuban Armed Forces, Raúl’s power was never in doubt.Despite a natural allergy to the limelight, Raúl reigned as Cuba’s co-ruler for a half century. The brothers knew each other’s talents and limitations together they were the most successful political brother act in history. .Affable and deferential, Díaz-Canel formerly served as Raúl’s bodyguard, cementing a trusted relationship with both brothers. A former minister of higher education who diligently ascended through the party ranks, he favors casual dress and bicycling, and has supported gay rights. An electronics engineer by training, Díaz-Canel became party chief in his home province of Villa Clara in the 1990s. In 2003, he was moved to be party chief in Holguin province, a centre of Cuba\u0027s burgeoning tourism industry and foreign investment. In 2009, he was summoned to Havana to be higher education minister, and in 2013 Castro appointed him as first-vice president. Since then he has stood in for Castro at political events, received foreign dignitaries and travelled abroad on behalf of the government.\u0026nbspDíaz-Canel\u0027s policy views remain mostly an enigma in a country where political campaigning is banned. On the one hand he is from a younger generation of leaders and has advocated modernising Cuba on the other he is a longtime Communist party apparatchik who is not expected to push for sweeping political change.As a young provincial party chief, he bucked party orthodoxy by backing an LGBT-friendly cultural centre in Santa Clara, reportedly listening to rock music and sporting long hair. At a national level, he called for more critical coverage of events in state-run media and broader internet access to open one of the world\u0027s least web-connected societies.\u0026nbspUltimately though, he appears to have earned Castro\u0027s trust by sticking to the party line on key political and economic issues, analysts say.While Díaz-Canel\u0027s public persona has been reserved, even dour, since he joined the national government nine years ago, residents in his home province of Villa Clara enthuse about him as a handsome, friendly man of the people who gets things done.\u0026nbspFuel was so scarce in the 1990s that he cycled to work wearing shorts instead of commuting by Soviet-made Lada like other party leaders, locals said. He has also been lauded for backing the Santa Clara culture centre at a time when homophobia was commonplace in the party.\u0026nbspA music lover, Díaz-Canel would reportedly bring his two children from his first marriage to the centre\u0027s youth events, dancing there himself in the evenings. ReutersMore importantly, he is not a showboater and evinces zero personal ambition – thus avoiding the kiss of death for several previous would-be Castro successors.Díaz-Canel defines himself as a Raulista economic reformer, meaning he will continue loosening the state’s stranglehold on private enterprise – but slowly and cautiously. That may not be enough.Raúl Castro aspired to be Cuba’s Deng Xiaoping. Despite his brother’s resistance, he revamped the country’s bankrupt communist model by tweaking it into a version of market socialism with limited private enterprise. But he was never able to haul Cuba out of the red, despite billions in debt forgiveness. The country remains mired in a two-tier currency system that is deeply unpopular.Since 1959, Cuba’s economic model – with its relatively generous health and education benefits – has depended upon having a patron. For decades, the Soviet Union picked up the country’s tab Hugo Chávez’s Venezuela was even more obliging. But after Chávez’s death and amid Venezuela’s spiraling collapse into a failed state, the economic pipeline has been reduced to a drip, and Cuba remains knee-deep in debt. Díaz-Canel will probably find the seat of power a bit crowded. Although Fidel once said “Cuba is not a dynasty”, the evidence suggests otherwise. Raúl has long served as the Castro family patriarch and the family remains his most innermost circle. The decisive power players in Cuba will remain Raúl’s only son, Col Alejandro Castro Espín, 52, who heads intelligence and domestic security for the army and interior ministry and Raúl’s son-in-law, Gen Luis Alberto Rodríguez López-Callejas, married to though long separated from Raúl’s eldest child, Deborah. Clearly being groomed for the future, Alejandro has been at his father’s side during all significant meetings with foreign leaders, and served as the lead negotiator ahead of Cuba’s rapprochement with the US. As the longtime chief of Gaesa, the economic behemoth of the army that controls the country’s major business interests and investments, Rodríguez functions as Cuba’s CEO. Close by is Luis Alberto’s son, Raulito, 32, who has served as his grandfather’s bodyguard. Raúl’s daughter, the outspoken Mariela Castro Espín, 55, is a member of the national assembly who has promoted LGBT rights. But unlike her brother, she is not a key political player.None of Fidel’s sons are personally invested in politics, even less so after the suicide of his eldest son, Fidelito, earlier this year. For younger Cubans, Miguel Díaz-Canel gets points for being under 60, for championing access – albeit censored – to the internet, and for being an ally to Mariela’s LGBT campaign.But no one expects him to buff up Cuba’s human rights record, which last week was condemned by the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who blasted Cuba as “an infamous dictatorship”. Then there is the perennial thorny problem of its superpower northern neighbor: Donald Trump has remained unremittingly hostile, and partially reversed Barack Obama’s historic detente with the island. Once again, as during the cold war, the US embassy is down to a skeletal staff, in retribution for the so-called “sonic attacks” on embassy personnel. (Never mind that the cause and perpetrators have yet to be definitively determined.) Recent years have seen several historic changes in Cuba, including Obama’s rapprochement and the end of “the Wet Foot-Dry Foot” immigration policy, which rewarded citizenship to any Cuban who appeared on US shores. Some might have thought Raúl’s retirement as president was another such a game-changer. But with the army and party still firmly under his wing, it is not – at least for now.

Members find each other in traffic by honking their horn – one long honk, followed by two short ones. Others identify each other by completing nonsensical couplets: “The son of heaven covers the tiger” – to which the correct response is “chicken stew with mushrooms”.They call themselves duanyou after the app Neihan Duanzi, or “implied jokes”, where until recently some 30 million users could watch short videos, comedy sketches and follow dirty jokes and memes. Fans also organise offline meet-ups. At one gathering in Hunan province earlier this month, a group posed in a parking lot with little red flags and a sign describing themselves as the “duanyou coalition”.China’s media regulator on 10 April ordered Neihan Duanzi’s parent company and one of the country’s fastest-growing internet companies, Bytedance, to shut down the app because of its “vulgar” content. It was one of several news apps to be removed from online stores or shuttered this month.The group’s unofficial song, On Earth, a ballad about life’s struggles, has been censored. Cities from Shanghai to Changde in Hunan province have placed restrictions on honking. Authorities have advised news outlets not to report on fan gatherings. The founder and CEO of Toutiao, the news platform where Neihan Duanzi was first hosted, issued a public apology for failing to “promote positive energy and grasp correct guidance of public opinion”.The app’s closure and subsequent restrictions offer more evidence of how China’s censorship is moving beyond politically sensitive topics to seemingly benign content like entertainment and humour. It is also a campaign more likely to cause backlash among the general public, observers say. In a country where topics from human rights to Winnie the Pooh, a nickname for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, are routinely censored, it is the closure of a joke app that has riled citizens most in years.For some Duanzi fans, the app doesn’t just provide an escape from the tedium of daily life but a sense of belonging. Users quip back and forth, referencing inside jokes and phrases only other duanyou would know. The code phrase “the son of heaven covers the tiger” is a saying used by bandits in a popular Chinese novel from the 1950s.In real life, duanyou groups get together for dinners, go rafting, hold barbecues, sing karaoke, or just hang out by their cars. Some get involved in local causes, raising money. In a post on a Duanzi forum this week, one user asked other duanyou to drive their cars to his wedding in order to beep and cheer him on.“Neihan Duanzi contains normal people’s happiness ... Duanyou make fun of each other ... but if you meet another offline, he will give you a cigarette. Strangers can have a meal together like old friends,” a journalist wrote on the Chinese tech news site PingWest last year.Now, some duanyou are moving underground. They’ve started chat groups on platforms like Telegram, which can only be used via VPN in China. They complain about the Duanzi ban and talk openly about politics and tightening controls over Chinese society. Others are in private WeChat or QQ groups for duanyou. Duanzi videos are still circulating online.“I’ve been a Neihan Duanzi user for two years and never even thought of putting a sticker on my car. Occasionally I’d honk at a duanyou’s car. But when Duanzi was censored, I felt a certain pain in my heart, like someone had taken my child from me,” one user wrote on 12 April in a Duanzi Telegram group that has more than 2,000 members.By shutting down Neihan Duanzi, authorities may have targeted a segment of Chinese society for whom this app is especially important. While the app’s appeal is broad, it seems especially popular among those with less education, from China’s less-developed cities. Teng Wei, a cultural studies scholar based in Guangzhou, calls them China’s “new poor”, a group defined not by their income so much as by what they don’t or cannot buy.According to Teng, they are often young people born in rural areas who have relocated to larger cities and who, in between the village and the city, lack a sense of identity outside of virtual spaces like Duanzi. Videos on the app, filmed and uploaded from all over the country, often feature scenarios and skits in China’s poorer second- and third-tier cities.In one popular Duanzi video, a man in an unbuttoned shirt with long hair pulled into a messy pony tail comes across his girlfriend walking with another man, much more smartly dressed. His girlfriend proceeds to break up with him because her new beau, she says, “pays more attention” and has bought her a BMW and an iPhone X.“Being poor no longer means you don’t have property or a job it simply means you are not consuming,” Teng wrote in a 2016 essay about fans of another video app, Kuaishou, whose following she believes is similar to that of Duanzi. That app was also singled out this month for inappropriate content.By censoring this group, Beijing also risks losing a support base: young people known as “little pink” for their sympathies with China’s ruling Communist party, whose official colour is red. Videos and content on the app are often more nationalistically skewed.“Overall, they seemed to be aligned with the government and now they face this situation,” said Zhou Fengsuo, a Chinese human rights activist who was a leader in China’s 1989 democracy protests and is now based in the US. “This is a pretty common pattern in China where people keep going with their regular life until suddenly one day you are the victim of arbitrary rules.” Observers say it will be difficult to fully disband these communities, who are still looking for an outlet. “Soon another app will come out,” Teng said. “Consumers are always looking for something new.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf59ba0d46e7b0efbfe44da5fd450cc61544d255/0_317_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=94f34320973c00965c28331c888fd316 1240w","title":"south africa riots force president to leave commonwealth summit","story":"Cyril Ramaphosa travels to North West province where police have fired rubber bullets during protests over alleged corruption and failing servicesSouth African police have fired rubber bullets at protesters as violent riots forced President Cyril Ramaphosa to cut short his attendance at the Commonwealth leaders’ summit in London.Shops were looted, roads were blocked and vehicles set alight in North West province on Friday in unrest over alleged government corruption and poor public services. At least 23 people were arrested and one man was reported to have died in sporadic violence that erupted this week in Mahikeng, the provincial capital.Ramaphosa, who came to power in February, called for calm following more than six hours of talks with local leaders in the city of Mahikeng. North West province has been a hotbed of unrest due to boiling frustration over lack of housing, health services and jobs.Police fired rubber bullets as protesters hid behind cardboard sheets, while roads were littered with burning tyres and bricks that had been thrown through the air.At the end of the talks Ramaphosa appealed for an end to the unrest, promising a “speedy” resolution of the crisis. “Let us be calm, let us return to a position of normalcy as we address this matter and reach finality on it,” he said in an address broadcast live from the city.He said he had been made to understand during the talks that the unrest had been sparked by concerns over the position of the provincial premier, corruption and governance.“These are matters that are serious enough” to warrant broad consultation in the party and the national government “on an urgent basis”, he said.“We are going to act as speedily as possible to address each of the issues that have been raised,” he added.The trigger for the unrest was reportedly the death on Tuesday of two patients at a health clinic that was closed due to a month-long dispute over health workers’ salaries and contracts.Much of the anger has been directed at Supra Mahumapelo, the provincial premier, who is accused of involvement in graft scandals that have engulfed the ruling ANC party.The border to neighbouring Botswana was closed due to the violence, while schools, shops, offices and government services across North West province were shut.Local residents said foreign-owned shops were the first to be targeted by looters. “Very poor people are in dire need. Those people looted foreigners’ shops,” said Leveticus Molosankwe, 43.“They have taken advantage of the political situation as people plead for the removal of Mahumapelo. This has been simmering for months.”Thapelo Galeboe, member of the local Communist party branch, said the premier ruled “like an emperor” in the province. “The health system has completely collapsed. Hospitals are filthy. Families close to the premier have benefited in a very corrupt manner from tenders,” he said.Ramaphosa took over as leader of the ruling ANC in December and subsequently replaced Jacob Zuma as national president. Zuma’s nine-year tenure saddled South Africa with weak growth, ballooning national debt, depressed investor confidence and record unemployment.The ANC forced Zuma from office in February largely due to his mounting legal challenges and multiple corruption scandals, and the party has distanced itself from its former leader.Ramaphosa has vowed to crack down on government corruption, which he has admitted is a serious problem, and improve South Africa’s ability to attract foreign investment.Zuma appeared in court earlier this month at a preliminary hearing on graft charges that he denies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3459762.1524066741!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"getting up close and digital with nature s miniature life","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBumblebee at broad bean flowers. Illustration: Michael VineyWith a teenager’s devotion to a wild idea, I once turned the family greenhouse into a photographic darkroom. It was the only uncontested space, and its cardboard blackout was proof against all but the brightest chinks of starlight. My first enlarger, conjured from a mysterious, fatherly deal in the pub, was an Edwardian antique of mahogany and brass. It stretched horizontally along the potting bench, the bellows extending on tracks. Its fist-size lens threw a diamond-sharp image, once I had managed to sandwich my modest square of film where the big glass plate of a negative used to go.Making a print was slow, messy and laborious, involving smelly chemicals. As I became more ambitious, the cost of a perfect 10 x 8 print, its darks rich and velvety, could be quite high. But the feeling of accomplishment, of solitary, magical creativity, was incomparable. Moving a digital image from camera to computer screen, all with a click or two, misses out on a whole slice of youthful fulfilment.My first camera, an aged twin-lens Voigtlander, could not focus nearer than a metre. With wooden tripod tied to my crossbar, I cycled off into the countryside for landscapes and quaint corners of stockbroker villages while haunted by Ansel Adams’s wild and wonderful boulders and peaks of Yosemite, borrowed from the town library.Half a century on, in the digital age, I also delight in a different scale of nature – its miniatures – as the rich flow of images from readers arrives at “Eye on Nature”. The capacity of smartphone cameras to get in close, often to a hand’s breadth of the subject, has embraced the beauty and interest of the single flower or woodland mushroom, the single beetle or bumblebee, the inidual butterfly or moth, and (I sometimes shrink to see) the poised and solitary spider. Along with the images comes the quest to know more, which Ethna tries to satisfy.Among Europe’s finest close-up photographers is Dr Robert Thompson, who is based in Banbridge, Co Down. An entomologist, he knows what everything is and where it’s likely to be. I met up with him once in the dunes along the shore and marvelled at the range of Nikon hardware clustered weightily across his chest: if not this camera, then that one, and whichever lens, tripod, knee pads or ancillary gadget needed for the shot.Thompson’s classic work has already been seen in weighty volumes of dragonflies, butterflies and moths published by the Ulster Museum. He has now produced a masterly guide, Close-up and Macro Photography: Its Art and Fieldcraft Techniques. It’s not cheap – €41 even in the hefty, large-format paperback – but it is visually thrilling and technically exhaustive.Thompson’s life as a professional natural history photographer means marketing flawless photos with impact and a personal style: “branding”, as he puts it. Along with the right exposure, white balance, colour temperature and expertise with clinical software comes an artistic gift for an image that draws a gasp.The fieldcraft offered by Thompson, moving from one habitat to another, can be beguilingly practical, as in keeping one’s head off the skyline while stalking dragonflies perched at a pond, or searching for the one mushroom the slugs haven’t got to.Wind and weather count as much as knowing where and when to look, and blue-sky, breezy days are definitely not the best. There are flexible yokes to hold a flower still (among them the wonderful “Wimberley Plamp”), tripods that sprawl obligingly flat on the ground, and screens that diffuse the overly harsh light of bright sun.Early morning finds the light kindest and insects still torpidly waiting to be warmed into life. When they’re flying, a light shower of rain can bring them down to the leaves and add sparkling drops to a flower or a dragonfly’s wing. In winter, soft mist can bejewel a spider’s web or frost coat a seed head or berry in diamonds.Close-up and “macro” photography are not the same: the latter means images often greatly enlarged from life. Not everyone enjoys inspecting the glaze on a wasp’s eyeball. Thompson usually settles for doubling the size, perhaps with telephoto lens and extension tube. If there is a special style to his work, it shows up well in his exquisite studies of day-flying moths pretending to be tree bark and of ineffably elegant caterpillars and dragonflies, or flowers showing off their stamens.His scope widens to lichens, fungi, rock pools and streams (bring your own aquarium and put everything back where you found it). And given his ruthless perfectionism – every hair glistening, every petal immaculate – it is reassuring to be told that smartphone and mobile phone cameras can often yield “acceptable” images.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneLocked away in Scouting Ireland’s national office in Larch Hill, Tibradden, south county Dublin, sit hundreds of past child-protection case files in an alarmed room under lock and key, some dating back decades.Most staff working in the organisation’s headquarters go about each day without a thought about the ageing folders gathering dust in the organisation’s national office near the Co Wicklow border, which is sheltered by woods and is set amid surrounding campsite fields.The potential revelations within those safeguarding files about how past cases were handled, which range from minor incidents to more serious allegations of abuse, remain undisturbed.But an initial look at a small number of serious sexual abuse allegations among the historic files showed they “haven’t been handled well”, according to one senior source.A full audit of all historic cases of alleged abuse, which five months ago safeguarding expert Ian Elliott recommended should take place, has not started. In January he told Scouting Ireland’s board again the historic review should be a “priority”, given that “past practice has been shown to be suspect regarding alleged abuse” cases.The cases must be reviewed to make sure there is no risk to current members due to potential “mismanagement” of past allegations, Elliott told the organisation’s board last November. Scouting Ireland hired Elliott last July to review its safeguarding structure.The organisation, which has 40,000 juvenile members, needs to know if an alleged abuser in any case handled incorrectly is still alive or active in the organisation, he said.Elliott’s report examined more than 20 sample case files, and found that a practice of lobbying for – and from – the subjects of allegations appeared to have gone unchecked, and in several cases “directly led to bad decisions being made”.“In each of the cases that I examined there was evidence of the subject of the complaint making attempts to influence the process through lobbying. It appears that this was accepted practice,” he said, adding anyone outside the organisation would view it as “unacceptable”.“Be prepared” is the scouting motto. It’s unlikely many of Scouting Ireland’s board members were prepared for the public and political turmoil the findings of Elliott’s confidential work would create for the organisation that traces its roots to 1908, which have been revealed in a series of reports by The Irish Times.Overall, Elliott found “significant gaps” in its safeguarding structures and an absence of written policies for what was acceptable behaviour for volunteers.The stakes for Scouting Ireland were nothing less than “extinction”, Elliott warned, if it ignored the failings he identified, and did not act to establish “safe practice” when it came to child protection.Elliott headed the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland for six years, where he led the reforms of the church’s child-protection structures.Drawing on this, Elliott asked the board to reflect on the “devastating impact” unaddressed risk had had on the church, an organisation “that thought itself as being impregnable”.“Risk to children was not addressed and bad decisions were regularly made involving denial and cover-up. The organisation tried to protect itself and its accused members, losing sight of the need to protect actual and potential victims. The consequences were not only massive financial loss but severe reputational damage that will take many years to fade,” Elliott said.A small number of civil legal actions from alleged victims of sexual abuse, claiming organisations had failed to protect them from preventable harm, could result in huge financial cost, often in six figures.However, Elliott commended Scouting Ireland for commissioning the robust review, and its “willingness “ to be prepared to face difficult issues, even ones dated far back in the past.In one case, Elliott was asked review an allegation made by a female adult leader in 2016, who claimed she had been raped by a male adult leader on a camping trip seven years earlier, when she was 18 years old.Reporting back, he criticised the actions of chief scout Christy McCann, David Shalloo (chief commissioner for youth affairs), Thérèse Bermingham (chief commissioner for adult resources) and ordinary board member Ollie Kehoe.Barrister Lorna Lynch has been hired to independently inquire into the “reported actions” of the four senior volunteers. The four officers stepped aside on Thursday night, pending the conclusion of Lynch’s inquiry.The move came after Minister for Children Katherine Zappone suspended State funding worth nearly €1 million a year to the organisation, over concerns about its governance.Following the leak of Elliott’s report to The Irish Times, some directors circled the wagons. In a statement, McCann said the disclosure of the confidential report had been a “betrayal and a breach of trust”. At national council level, the whistleblower was accused of breaking the scout law, which states: “A scout is to be trusted. A scout is loyal.”Scouting Ireland is “volunteer-led”, meaning the role of staff is to implement the policy set by the volunteers. There is a tension between the two sides of the organisation in some cases staff felt pressured by lobbying from volunteers over their work, but volunteers have also reported “heavy-handed” responses from staff to complaints.An unpublished internal fact-finding report obtained by The Irish Times found that tension between staff and volunteers was serving the organisation “very poorly”. The report, carried out by a mediation consultant in recent years, examined relationship breakdowns in Co Galway. It concluded there was a “them-and-us” ide that would only widen if left unaddressed, but a follow-up report was not commissioned.Dublin City Council Labour councillor Dermot Lacey, a long-time scouting volunteer, said he had “learned more about politics in scouting than he ever did in City Hall as a councillor”.There is a strong level of loyalty between senior volunteers, which was “natural” between people who work together, Lacey said. But accountability is needed when things went wrong.Garrett Flynn, former board member and chairman of 115th Ballinteer scout group, said a reform of the board was required. “I would feel there should be a combination of people who come from a strong scouting background, and then people with a solid corporate background or major charity experience,” he said.The apparent “failure to follow procedure” at national level, detailed in Elliott’s report, should not be allowed to reflect poorly on local scout troops, he said. “All this boardroom stuff is detached from the day-to-day scouting in communities,” he said.Scouting Ireland has found itself in the spotlight previously, often in tragic cases where young members have died while on scouting trips.On Sunday, December 6th, 2015, Aoife Winterlich (14), who lived in Walkinstown, Dublin, was with a small group of scouts when she and three others were knocked into the sea from rocks near Hook Head lighthouse in Co Wexford. She was winched from the water along with another scout, Philip Byrne, by an Irish Coast Guard helicopter, and taken to Waterford General Hospital, but died several days later.The tragedy occurred while the scouts had been given 20 minutes’ “free time” to eat their lunch, an inquest into the incident heard. The two scout leaders had told them to stay within the walls of the lighthouse yard. At the inquest, Byrne said he did not recall being told not to go down to the rocks. The trip to the lighthouse took place during the week of Storm Desmond.The inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure, and the cause of death was brain damage due to a near-drowning.Scouting Ireland is currently carrying out a review into the incident. However, the young girl’s mother, Anne Winterlich, was critical this was only happening more than two years after the incident.“I was hugely upset at the fact that a report was not done into Aoife’s death, it should have been done,” said Winterlich, who is involved in legal proceedings with Scouting Ireland.The fact that a report had not been launched automatically after the death of a juvenile member was “worrying for an organisation with all those children in their care,” she said.Aoife Winterlich had joined the scouts only shortly before the trip, and was described by her mother as a “funny, kind, beautiful and creative” girl.“I think what they should have said was: ‘What happened was horrendous’ and make assurances that changes will be made that this will never happen again,” she said. “I would have expected an apology, as any parent would under the circumstances.”Scouting Ireland did not respond to questions on when the report into Aoife Winterlich’s death is expected to be completed.In response to Elliott’s report, Scouting Ireland has made a number of reforms. When an allegation is made against a leader, they are “suspended without prejudice” pending an investigation, rather than asked to voluntarily stand aside.

Photograph: EPAKCNA North Korea will immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap its nuclear test site and instead pursue economic growth and peace, the North’s state media said on Saturday, ahead of planned summits with South Korea and the United States.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his country no longer needed to conduct nuclear tests or intercontinental ballistic missile tests because it had completed its goal of developing nuclear weapons, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.North Korea said that to create an “international environment favourable” for its economy, it would “facilitate close contact and active dialogue” with neighbouring countries and the international community.It was the first time Kim directly addressed his position on North Korea’s nuclear weapons programmes ahead of planned summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in next week and with US President Donald Trump in late May or early June.The pledge to halt the development of nuclear weapons, initiated by his grandfather and continued by his father, would mean a significant reversal for the young, third-generation leader, now 34, who has staked his security on his nuclear arsenal and spent years celebrating such weapons as an integral part of his regime’s legitimacy and power.A testing freeze and commitment to close a test site alone would fall short of Washington’s demand that Pyongyang completely dismantle all of its nuclear weapons and missiles.But announcing the concessions now, rather than during summit meetings, shows Kim is serious about denuclearisation talks, experts say.“The northern nuclear test ground of the DPRK will be dismantled to transparently guarantee the discontinuance of the nuclear test,” KCNA said after Kim convened a plenary session of the Central Committee of the ruling Worker’s Party on Friday.The North’s official name is the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK).The Pyunggye-ri site in northern North Korea is its only known nuclear test site, where all of its six underground tests were conducted, including the last, its largest-ever detonation, in September.“We will concentrate all efforts on building a powerful socialist economy and markedly improving the standard of people’s living through the mobilisation of all human and material resources of the country,” KCNA said.Trump welcomed the statement and said he looked forward to a summit with Kim.“North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit,” Trump said on Twitter.“Progress being made for all!” he said in a later tweet.South Korea said the North’s decision signified “meaningful” progress toward denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and would create favourable conditions for successful meetings with it and the United States.China, North Korea’s sole major ally which has nevertheless been frustrated by its defiant development of weapons, welcomed the announcement saying it would ease tension and promote denuclearisation.“The Chinese side believes that North Korea’s decision will help ameliorate the situation on the peninsula,” a foreign ministry spokesman, Lu Kang, said in a statement.Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also welcomed the North Korean statement but said it must lead to action.“What’s important is that this leads to complete, verifiable denuclearisation. I want to emphasise this,” Abe told reporters.The United States, Japan and South Korea have historically been the main targets of North Korea’s anger.“We’re all looking for evidence that Kim is really serious about negotiations, and announcements like this certainly suggest he is, and that he is trying to make clear to the world that he is,” said David Wright, co-director of the Global Security Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.North Korea has said its nuclear and missile programmes are necessary deterrents against US hostility. It has conducted numerous missile tests with the aim of being able to hit the United States with a nuclear bomb.The tests and escalating rhetoric between Trump and Kim raised fears of war until, in a New Year’s speech, the North Korean leader called for reduced military tensions.He sent a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South in February, leading to warmer ties with the South.Nam Sung-wook, professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul, said it was “sensational” that Kim had personally declared plans to suspend nuclear development, but added that his remarks left a number of questions.“It still does not seem clear if it means whether the North will just not pursue further development of its nuclear programmes in the future, or whether they will completely shut down ‘all’ nuclear facilities. And what are they going to do with their existing nuclear weapons?” Nam said.South Korean President Moon said on Thursday North Korea had expressed a commitment to “complete denuclearisation” of the Korean peninsula, and had not attached conditions, but Washington had remained wary and vowed to maintain “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang.The United States said on Thursday that in the run-up to Trump’s planned summit with Kim, countries should continue to put financial and diplomatic pressure on Pyongyang to surrender its banned nuclear weapons.Many US officials and experts doubt Kim’s sincerity about denuclearising, viewing the recent flurry of diplomacy as a ploy to win relief from economic sanctions.Ordinary South Koreans were also cautious after the latest announcement.“I don’t think we can completely trust anything North Korea says because North Korea isn’t a normal country,” said Kim Han-nuri (23) out in Seoul on a sunny spring morning.UN Security Council sanctions imposed on North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and extended over the past decade have aimed to deny it a considerable amount of international trade, banning critical exports such as coal, iron ore, seafood, textile while limiting oil imports.That has threatened the policy of “byungjin” - simultaneous military and economic development - that Kim Jong Un has adopted since taking power in late 2011.“Easing tensions and cooperating with the international community is critical if Kim wanted to advance the economy,” said Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at the Sejong Institute think-tank south of Seoul.Koh Yu-hwan, professor of North Korean Studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, said he did not believe Pyongyang was ready to give up its existing nuclear weapons and missiles.“Kim is just saying that now that the nuclear development is complete, he will put all the efforts toward building an economy,” Koh said.Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3468658.1524242996!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"le big mac emmanuel macron s rise and rise","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWinning ways: Emmanuel Macron at his victory rally in Paris after being elected president, in May 2017. Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The Irish Times travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the Guardian. “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”Thank you for signing up.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"there s a hole and someone went out southwest pilot tells air traffic control","story":"  April 18, 2018Plane violently depressurized after fragments from the explosion burst through window   April 19, 2018With horrifying suddenness, an engine exploded and a passenger was partly sucked through a broken window Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Last year, just 243 cases were reported.Health officials suspect the rise can be attributed to holidaymnakers returning from the continent. In Europe, there has been a large outbreak in measles this year.Dr Yvonne Doyle, London regional director for Public Health England, said: “We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across  London which could lead to a wider outbreak in unvaccinated children and adults.Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms“Those who have not received two doses of the vaccine in the past — or who are unsure — should speak to their GP. There’s no harm in receiving an additional dose where there is any uncertainty.“It’s crucial pregnant women have been vaccinated with MMR, as rubella in particular can cause serious complications during pregnancy.”Measles is a highly contagious infectious disease which usually starts with cold-like symptoms, fever and red, sensitive eyes. It can spread very easily and can be caught by breathing in droplets from an infected person when they cough or sneeze.In rare cases, complications can include deafness, blindness and swelling of the brain, leading to brain damage, and in even more rare cases, a progresssive disorder.Please review our commenting policyNorth Korea suspends missile launches and shuts down nuclear test site ahead of key summitsEarth Day 2018: The shocking facts about the scale of plastic pollution choking our seas Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsEurope orders emergency checks on engine type that exploded in fatal Southwest Airlines incidentDNA breakthrough brings arrest in one of Britain\u0026#39s longest unsolved child killingsRachel Weisz and Daniel Craig share pregnancy news: \u0026#39We’re going to have a little human\u0026#39Smallville actress Allison Mack arrested in New York sex cult caseDonald Trump to visit UK in late summer, senior US official saysHither Green: Police arrest remaining suspect in Kent two weeks after burglar was stabbed to deathGunman opens fire at school on day when students walk out of classes in protest at gun violenceLondon Marathon rule change to attract more women causes fury as men will have to run faster to qualifyPolice identify key suspects in nerve agent attack on Sergei SkripalBritish man with first case of \u0026#39super-gonorrhoea\u0026#39 is curedPrince Charles \u0026#39deeply touched\u0026#39 to be confirmed as Queen\u0026#39s Head of the Commonwealth successorTwitter goes down around the world as woes continueJudge \u0026#39blocks\u0026#39 sale of Frida Kahlo doll after complaint from Mexican artist\u0026#39s familyThreatened 700-year-old Banyan tree put on intravenous drip Employers confused by new GCSE grading system as a quarter think bottom grade is the best markGirl outwits gang wielding baseball bats by hiding behind wallWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/20/TELEMMGLPICT000153518278_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7HMK2zxZA3UhAmtdFkRSTm4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"rachel weisz daniel craig share pregnancy news going have little","story":"\u0026#34Daniel and I are so happy. We’re going to have a little human\u0026#34, she announcedWhen Rachel Weisz was asked in 2012, a year after marrying Daniel Craig, if the couple would have a child, she replied: “Never say never.”On Friday, she had some unexpected  news to announce. “Daniel and I are so happy. We’re going to have a little human. We can’t wait to meet him or her. It’s all such a mystery,” she said.At 48, the Oscar-nominated actress joins the growing number of women having a baby in their fifth decade.It will be the first child for the couple. Weisz has an 11-year-old son from her former relationship with Darren Aronofsky, the film director. While Craig, 50, has a 25-year-old daughter from his previous marriage to Fiona Loudon, an actress.Weisz, star of The Constant Gardener and The Mummy, made the disclosure in an interview with the New York Times, in which a journalist asked the secret of her “glowing” complexion. The actress replied that she was pregnant, and that she would “be showing soon”. She turned 48 last month.The actress revealed she was pregnant, and that she would “be showing soon”Recent figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the over-40s are the only age group with a growing pregnancy rate in England and Wales.Women having babies in their late 40s, however, remains relatively rare – 2,109 of the 688,262 births in 2016 were to women aged 45 and over.Halle Berry, the Hollywood actress, had a baby at 47 and Cherie Blair gave birth to her fourth child at 45. Dame Julia Peyton-Jones, the former head of the Serpentine Gallery, surprised the art world last year by having a baby girl at the age of 64. Halle Berry, the Hollywood actress, had a baby at 47 Weisz and Craig married in 2011. Asked in an interview the following year if she planned to have another child, she said: “I’m pretty content. I’m not planning on having more, but never say never.”In the The New York Times interview, the actress spoke about her  relationship. “I’m very happy being married, very, very happy,” she said. The couple ide their time between homes in London and New York.While claiming she “really takes her hat off” to celebrity couples who turn themselves into a brand, Weisz said she could not countenance doing that.“Daniel and I are really similar. We just literally don’t know how to do that. We’re just really rubbish at talking about our private lives,” she said. In the interview, Weisz was asked about Craig’s infamous comment that he would rather slash his wrists than play James Bond again. He had just finished shooting Spectre.“He was just tired. He needed a really long nap and a glass of wine,” she said. “It would be like if you asked someone who just had a baby, ‘Do you want another one that day?’ They’d just go, ‘NO!’”In another interview earlier this year, Weisz spoke about protecting the privacy of her son, Henry. “He didn’t choose to have a mum who’s in the public eye, so I try to keep him away from my career. He’s also not very interested in it,” she joked.Disobedience, her latest film, is a love triangle set in the Orthodox Jewish community of north London and is adapted from the novel by Naomi Alderman.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.Email cannot be used.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ Email cannot be used.

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 17,500 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpaths (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Yet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation (Sheffield Tree Action Group)Certainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers.

Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.In this way dozens of limes, cherries, oaks and birches across several neighbourhoods were saved.But as tensions rose – with both fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidation – police started to appear.Jenny Hockey (left), Freda Brayshaw and a third neighbour were arrested and locked up for eight hours (PA)At one demonstration in leafy Chippinghouse Road in January 2017, nine people were arrested, some while stood in their own gardens. None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”Email cannot be used.

The biggest set of economic decisions over the course of the next few years are going to be taken in the Brexit negotiations and whatever deal we end up with. And then we will adjust to the impact of those decisions in order to keep the economy on a stable path.”Earlier on Thursday retail sales data for March came in worse than expected. This followed a bigger than anticipated decline in inflation in March.“We have had some mixed data,” Mr Carney said.“On the softer side some of the business surveys have come off. Retail sales have been a bit softer – we are all aware of the squeeze that is going on in the high street. We’ll sit down calmly and look at it all in the round.”Allan Monks of JP Morgan said the implication of Mr Carney’s words were that the Bank could pause in May and hike later in the year. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the people Dr Ilardo met told her he once stayed underwater for 13 minutes while hunting.The Bajau village of Jaya BaktiJaya Bakti homes from the waterA Bajau villager demonstrates the use of traditional wooden gogglesA young Bajau girl looks on in excitement as her father, a traditional Bajau er, returns to Jaya Bakti from a two-week fishing tripThe population was interested in learning about their genetic heritage, and Dr Ilardo used a portable ultrasound machine to measure spleen size in 59 Bajau.She then measured spleen size in 34 people from a neighbouring village inhabited by non- Bajau people so she could make a comparison.When she took her data back to Denmark to analyse, Dr Ilardo found Bajau people had spleens around 50 per cent larger than their neighbours. Spleens are involved in the so-called “human e response”. When a body is submerged in cold water the heart rate slows, blood vessels in the extremities shrink and the spleen contracts.This contraction injects a spurt of additional oxygen-rich blood cells into circulation, allowing the body to survive for longer underwater. Dr Ilardo and her collaborators estimated the enlarged spleens of the Bajau could provide them with around 10 per cent more blood cells than someone with a normal-sized spleen.As well as measuring spleen size, Dr Ilardo took spit samples from the study participants so she could investigate the genetic basis for the differences she was seeing. She identified several genes that were observed far more frequently in the genomes of Bajau participants, including one – PDE10A – that is involved with the production of thyroid hormone, which in turn is associated with spleen size.We believe that in the Bajau they have an adaptation that increases thyroid hormone levels and therefore increases their spleen size, said Dr Ilardo. It\u0027s been shown in mice that thyroid hormones and spleen size are connected. “If you genetically alter mice to have an absence of the thyroid hormone T4, their spleen size is drastically reduced, but this effect is actually reversible with an injection of T4.This is the first adaptation for ing ever observed in humans. Previous work appeared to show that sea nomad children had superior underwater eyesight, but those results have since been disproved.The findings were published in the journal Cell. Despite initially warning Dr Ilardo against undertaking the work due to the likelihood she would find no significant results, her supervisors Professor Eske Willerslev and Professor Rasmus Nielsen think her findings are significant for a number of reasons.This is the first time that we really have a system like that in humans to study, said Dr Nielsen. “Nature has made experiments for us that tell us how humans react and adapt genetically to a whole new set of physiological conditions, so that we can explore and learn much more about the interaction between genetics and physiology.Understanding the genetics underpinning the Bajau’s abilities could even have applications in medical research – specifically for those trying to treat the condition of acute hypoxia, when body tissue experiences a rapid depletion of oxygen.There is also a fundamental need to understand the ersity of genes found in the world’s indigenous populations, said Professor Willerslev.This really tells us how valuable and important indigenous populations are around the world that are living extreme lifestyles, in terms of understanding the function of various genetic traits and finding the underlying genetic background for various physiological traits, he said. Most of these populations are completely understudied, and I think there is a huge benefit, not only potentially to them, but also to the rest of mankind by actually paying some attention to them.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The EU has previously rubbished such ideas in public and said that there would inevitably be “frictions” at borders if Britain leaves the customs union and single market, as Theresa May has pledged.British diplomats in Brussels are downplaying the apparent lack of progress on solving the border issue and say that talks on resolving the border via the future trade relationship are at a very early stage. UK officials confirmed that negotiators discussed the UK customs paper drawn up last year.Commenting on the talks at a regular briefing of journalists in Westminster, the prime minister’s spokesperson told reporters: “The two proposals we have put forward remain the basis for our negotiation position and what the PM set out at Mansion House.”After meetings in Brussels at the start of the week UK negotiators have now gone back to London and are expected to return after a week of taking stock. The European Commission is understood to have asked for fresh proposals from the UK side.The EU has said a final deal has to be struck on Britain’s withdrawal by October, with an interim summit in June as a waypoint. But with the clock ticking, there has still be little progress on the border question this year, despite the opening of talks about the future relationship this week.Under the Good Friday Agreement there can be no hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and both sides agree that none should return. The EU however says the customs union and single market must have external border checks to maintain their integrity. Commission negotiators effectively proposed moving the customs checks to the Irish seat between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, but Theresa May refused the approach after pressure from her allies in the DUP. The draft withdrawal agreement as envisaged by the EU says Britain can either come up with a specific solution to the border problem, remove the need for a hard border by negotiating a close trade relationship with the EU, or revert to a “backstop” option that would keep Britain in full alignment with relevant EU regulations.  But with Ms May having rules out membership of the customs union and single market the chance of solving the issue using the future relationship looks slim, barring a U-turn.An account of the talks briefed to the Daily Telegraph newspaper suggested that UK proposals were “annihilated” by EU officials and that they had been met with a “detailed and forensic rebuttal” of the longstanding customs partnership plan. British diplomats said this did not reflect their understanding of the meeting.Boris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

But the feisty feline navigated the long journey back to his original home in Raleigh, North Carolina, so that he could be with them again.Rather than welcoming him back, his original family took him to a local animal shelter and asked if he could be euthanised.The \u0027happiest cats in the world\u0027 might just be in MoroccoHowever, instead of putting him down, the shelter made a call to animal protection charity, Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), who took him into their shelter to be rehomed.When Toby first arrived at their shelter he was “laid back and “people-friendly”, but not too keen on other cats, the charity\u0027s communications manager Tara Lyn told The Independent.He has now found a home with mum, Michele, and her children, the charity said separately earlier this week.  He also has two other cats around the house to keep him company and his family says they are “getting along well”.Ms Lyn described Toby’s story as “heart-breaking”, adding that they did not know all the details about what the family asked for him to be put down but he got a second chance.Toby was rejected by the family he walked 12 miles to be with (Jenny Winston Photography)Toby the cat settles into his temporary home at the SPCA shelter in Raleigh (SPCA)Toby is infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which means that his immune system is weakened, but this should not prevent him from living a long, otherwise healthy life as long as he has people around him who look out for signs of secondary symptoms, and take him for regular appointments with a vet.Toby with his new mum Michele (SPCA)“If people are moved by Toby’s story, we ask that they take action rather than just commenting on the story online,” Ms Lyn said. “Toby wouldn’t have the happy ending that he has now if we didn’t have volunteers, staff and the funding to do the work we do. We hope his story inspires people to make a donation, consider adopting from a shelter or becoming a volunteer.

He said his act was inspired by a discussion he had at a conference that raised the issue of lower caste communities being denied entry to temples. He said he told students about a well-known legend in which a priest carried a Dalit devotee into a temple. When they expressed scepticism that a Hindu priest would do such a thing, he decided to do it himself.There is a lot of discrimination against Dalits but this stems from society, not from religious scriptures, Mr Aditya told the BBC. I hope others do the same - it doesn\u0027t mean everyone should literally carry a Dalit man on their shoulders. But they must welcome Dalits into temples and to participate in rituals, he added.Mr Rangarajan said other priests told him they would now do the same in their own temples . A Palestinian slings a shot by burning tires on the Israel-Gaza border, following a demonstration calling for the right to return.

The British people were very clear in the referendum.\u0026ldquoWe are leaving the European Union. Leaving the European Union also means taking back control of our borders and our trade.Mr Gove added: \u0026ldquoBeing able to sign our own free trade deals is a compelling and persuasive one.\u0026ldquoI know that when that case is put to the House of Commons it will rally Conservative MPs and others behind it.\u0026ldquoA case endorsed by 17.4 million people in the referendum and one the Government has pledged to honour.\u0026rdquoLabour\u0026rsquos Yvette Cooper and Tory Nicky Morgan have also now drafted a motion that urges Mrs May to include an \u0026ldquoeffective customs union\u0026rdquo in her Brexit negotiations.Senior Tories fear the latest reverse in the House of Lords could be the start of a series of defeats during the Lords Report Stage of the legislation, with a hardcore group of Remain-backing having tabled dozens more amendments.Analysis by the Change Britain pressure group has revealed that 10 fanatical Remain-backing peers have proposed a total of 338 amendments aimed at frustrating or even reversing the country\u0026rsquos departure from the EU.The research from the group, which wants a full break with Brussels, showed that Labour peer Lord Judd had tabled a massive 62 amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which is designed to transfer EU law into the UK to ensure a smooth Brexit process.Fellow Labour peer Lord Adonis had tabled 59 amendments while Lib Dem Lord Wallace of Tankerness was responsible for 49 of them.

That\u0026rsquos obviously why she is doing it. She is just generating headlines to try to sell her book,\u0026rdquo he said.He dismissed her claims, saying Los Angeles-born actress Meghan, who starred in the US TV legal drama Suits and has appeared in several films, had made her own success in life before meeting the fifth in line to the throne.\u0026ldquoShe\u0026rsquos a professional woman, so why knock her? This girl has barely got started. You could see from the television interview they gave when they got engaged that they are clearly two people very much in love.\u0026ldquoWhat a contrast with Prince Charles and Diana\u0026rsquos engagement interview.

She\u0026rsquos a professional woman, a humanitarian. I think the first conversation they had was about what she wanted to do to help other people. That rang a bell with him. It reminded him of his mother.\u0026rdquoHer previous career will also come in handy. \u0026ldquoShe\u0026rsquos joined the biggest soap opera in the world. She\u0026rsquos done her apprenticeship in Suits and now she\u0026rsquos just been cast in the biggest role she has ever had,\u0026rdquo he said.Even the Queen has been known to describe her job as acting when she is in private.\u0026nbspGETTYPrincess Diana, like Meghan Markle, was a dogged activist\u0026ldquoThe Queen has often said to me, what costume should I wear today?\u0026rdquo Burrell said. \u0026ldquoBut when she is back behind closed doors she is back as a wife, mother and grandmother.\u0026rdquo He suggested Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos shared interests and their desire to help improve people\u0026rsquos lives around the world would cement the May 19 marriage at George\u0026rsquos Chapel, Windsor, and make it last. The younger royals\u0026rsquo cocoon at Kensington Palace, away from prying eyes inside Buckingham Palace, will also mean they face less of the stifling interference that Greer cited as a reason for a quick orce. But Burrell warned that Meghan would still need to find a support network of friends or family to handle the pressure cooker atmosphere inside the Royal Family. The family side of that may be difficult, unlike for Kate, who has the support of the tight-knit Middleton family. Meghan is close to her mother, Doria Ragland, but she lives half a world away in Los Angeles and relations with much of the rest of the family are strained or nonexistent. \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure her friends will be Prince Harry\u0026rsquos friends at first but that will change,\u0026rdquo he said. \u0026ldquoShe needs to grow her own nucleus of friends. She just needs to have people around her she can trust.\u0026rdquo\u0026nbspGETTYPaul Burrell was a close confidant of Princess DianaBurrell, whose own two boys were playmates for Harry and his brother Prince William when they were young, said he thought Harry and Meghan would end up with a large family, drawing on his memories of how they were when they were younger. \u0026ldquoAs children, he and William both said they would have large families. I predict Meghan will be pregnant before Christmas. I bet William will have four. Both William and Harry wanted to have more brothers and sisters when they were young but it wasn\u0026rsquot to be,\u0026rdquo he said. Burrell, who orced his wife Maria after 32 years of marriage and married his \u0026ldquosoul mate\u0026rdquo Graham Cooper last year after coming out as gay, hailed Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos intention to campaign for gay rights through the Commonwealth, where 36 of the 53 nations still criminalise homosexual acts. \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos a tough job. You can\u0026rsquot force laws to be changed and tell countries what to do but over time countries can change. Even the Royal Family can change,\u0026rdquo he said, recalling how both William and Harry were schooled in gay rights by their mother at an early age.\u0026nbspGETTYBurrell says the royal couple\u0027s engagement video shows how in love they are\u0026ldquoShe taught the boys about gay rights. I remember Elton John and David Furnish coming to Kensington Palace for lunch with Diana and the boys and they were wearing rings. William asked about same sex marriage and she explained that they loved each other. \u0026ldquoDiana was before her time. I remember when we were in Angola on the landmines campaign, Diana saying to me, \u0026lsquoAll our souls weigh the same. We are all equal\u0026rsquo.\u0026rdquo Her crusades and her emotional torment inside the Royal Family eventually created a more tolerant approach inside The Firm that makes Harry and Meghan\u0026rsquos marriage more likely to survive, according to Burrell. \u0026ldquoWe are talking about a woman in 2018.

And it\u0027s all thanks to the yolk of a hen egg. It seems unbelievable.The couple started trying for a family in 2006 but it wasn\u0027t a success.

Mrs Elder said: We had really thought the treatment would work straight away, so to have found out it had failed was heartbreaking.But we refused to give up hope - we were desperate to become parents so we knew we would just keep trying.The couple had another attempt and Mrs Elder did fall pregnant, but she miscarried the baby a few weeks later.Doctors then recommended trying a different technique. So for the seventh course of fertility treatment, Mrs Elder had an intravenous treatment called intralipid infusion, which involves using yolk from a hen\u0027s egg.It works by fatty acids in the egg reducing the number of killer cells in the immune system.Sarah, who works as head of finance and operational services for Hospice Isle of Man, said: I\u0027d never heard of using egg yolk to try and have a baby before, but I was willing to try anything. We\u0027d been trying for a baby for seven years and I didn\u0027t know how much more we could both take.
