They are committed to introducing balanced and proportionate measures in an attempt to reverse the decline.’The MSC change in labelling is not expected to see prices going up. Consumers wanting to eat sustainably are predicted to switch to imported cod instead.

A painting attributed to Cimabue, the 13th-century genius who started the Renaissance, has turned up in Compiègne, where its elderly owner hung it for years above a hotplate between her kitchen and lounge.This is the second such discovery of a lost masterpiece by a golden name of western art in France in the last few years. In 2014, a painting of Judith and Holofernes turned up in an attic in Toulouse and was sensationally attributed to Caravaggio. This summer it was sold in a private deal. And wait – the same expert who has authenticated this domestic discovery and is selling it together with Senlis auction house Acteon is also the man who defied doubters to successfully promote the Toulouse Caravaggio.Clearly, Eric Turquin has got a very good eye for world-class treasures hidden in plain sight in sleepy French homes. Or has he got a breathless tendency to over-enthuse about “discoveries” that may be more complex than they seem?This has all the hallmarks of the marketing campaign that made the “Caravaggio in the attic” such a hit. The magic of finding a masterpiece in (or close to) a kitchen is an irresistible story. So irresistible it makes sceptics sound like spoilsports. We do not need to question Turquin’s good faith. But we do need to stand back and recognise the astonishing nature of the claim being made.If this is truly a Cimabue, it is a rare surviving work by the painter credited by Giorgio Vasari in his 1550 book The Lives of the Artists with liberating Italian art from starchy Byzantine formality by making human figures more alive and objects more three-dimensional. Those traits do appear in his “new” painting The Mocking of Christ: a crowd of impassioned people surround Jesus in front of two buildings that are shown in depth and shaded. Not much, but a beginning – the start of the discovery of real-life in art that would lead to Leonardo da Vinci.Yet any unsigned painting found in a kitchen corridor surely needs lengthy appraisal by many different experts. What’s worrying is the way this painting, like the Caravaggio from the loft, is being boldly called a Cimabue without wider discussion. This is the new norm at the profitable end of the Old Masters market. Great stories about unlikely discoveries sweep all before them, but art experts have recently been fooled by proven fakes. Shouldn’t the whole business of identifying masterpieces be a little more nuanced when there are known to be actual forgers out there doing uncannily convincing work? Not that I am saying this is a fake – just that the identification of old paintings is and always has been fraught with peril. It shouldn’t be accepted solely on the seller’s say-so, or because it makes a good story.It’s hard to be certain about Cimabue’s style. He is a near-legendary figure. Fewer than 20 of his paintings survive and they show just the rudiments of an artistic personality. His contemporary Dante wrote that he was made to look old hat by his younger and much more characterful rival, Giotto. Vasari falsely claimed he painted the Rucellai Madonna, a famous altarpiece in the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence that is credited today to the Sienese artist Duccio. This wasn’t an innocent mistake: Vasari was court artist to the Medici and wanted to credit Florence with starting the Renaissance. He therefore bigged up Cimabue and downplayed the equally pioneering painters of Siena.Are we doing the same to excitedly call this painting a Cimabue? Could its mixture of mystical gold space and real-life detail be by someone else? If attributed to a “follower of Cimabue” or even to a Sienese master, it would be less glamorous and less coveted than an original by this revered painter. Anyway, those people crowding Christ look a bit post-medieval to me. Maybe this painting was heavily restored at some time in the nearly 800-year history being credited to it, another potential complexity that would make it less super-marketable. A historical work of art is necessarily a mysterious thing: the more chiaroscuro you admit, the less of a drop-dead, solid-gold commodity it becomes.But questions are boring, and hesitation is dull. This is the Cimabue in the kitchen, and it’s yours to buy for about six million euros."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/463aa456503319eef594828477c5e11cabcc3536/0_0_5471_3655/master/5471.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=602e963ca04aaeb79f5adab8ff7fe3c2 1440w","title":"dutch house ann patchett review","story":"The house in Ann Patchett’s eighth novel is the last word in desirable real estate. “Seen from certain vantage points of distance, it appeared to float several inches above the hill it sat on. The panes of glass that surrounded the glass front doors were as big as storefront windows and held in place by wrought-iron vines. The windows both took in the sun and reflected it back against the wide lawn.”The sun-drenched Dutch House – so named not for its architecture but for the nationality of its original owners, the Van Hoebeeks – is in every sense a hot property. Built in boomtime 1920s Philadelphia, it boasts Delft mantels and marble floors, a ballroom and a dining room with a gilt ceiling “more in keeping with Versailles than Eastern Pennsylvania”. Crammed with silk chairs, tapestry ottomans, Chinese lamps and oil paintings, it is, as one of the characters observes, “a piece of art” and, like a piece of art, it ignites extreme reactions in the people who come into contact with it.First in line are the Conroys. Cyril Conroy is a hard-up but ambitious property developer with a talent for life-changing surprises. He acquires the house in 1946 when the Van Hoebeeks go bankrupt, taking possession not only of the building but of its servants and sumptuous contents, and installing his wife, Elna, and children, Maeve and Danny, in their ready-made new existence overnight. Their rags-to-riches move from a rental “the size of a postage stamp” to the Dutch House with its treasures spells the beginning of the end of the marriage. Elna’s disintegration, in all its flamboyant pathos and ascetic self-denial, is brilliantly handled. Insisting that she has “no business in a place like that, all those fireplaces and staircases, all those people waiting on me”, she flees to help the destitute in India. Art is not for everyone.When Elna goes, the Conroys are thrown into a crisis of archetypal proportions: “They had all become characters in the worst part of a fairytale.” The children are left to the ministrations of the cook and housekeeper, a pair of warm-hearted sisters (though Danny, like a fairytale prince, doesn’t realise for a long time that his two watchful s have their own backstory). Their father, in the way of 1940s fathers and fairytale kings, is too busy ruling his empire to oversee their care. Danny survives the loss of his mother because his sister – loving, resourceful Maeve, vividly drawn by Patchett – steps into the breach: “Maeve was there, with her red coat and her black hair, standing at the bottom of the stairs, the white marble floor with the little black squares.” She’s Snow White or Red Riding Hood as Vermeer might have painted her.Cyril introduces a young widow called Andrea and her two daughters to the Dutch House, and the fragile equilibrium of this kingdom is destroyed. Like all enchantresses, the demure but deadly Andrea has “a knack for making the impossible seem natural”, including marriage to Cyril. We know what happens next: once their stepmother has taken possession, Maeve and Danny will be systematically pushed out. But the question of what, if any, kind of reconciliation with the past might still be achieved after such a profound betrayal gives The Dutch House an irresistible narrative drive. It’s a mark of Patchett’s skill that the novel’s bold fairytale elements – its doubles and archetypes, its two children left to find their own way back to their home after being expelled – add up to a story that feels wholly naturalistic.There are other, more subtle literary templates underpinning the book. It’s no coincidence that Maeve has “a stack of Henry James novels on her bedside table” – among them The Turn of the Screw. An obsessive younger woman who comes to a big house and falls for the aloof owner? Check. Lost mother? Check. Terrorised children? Check. Stalwart and sceptical housekeeper? Check. “Lots of ghosts” (as Danny puts it)? Check that, too. If The Dutch House is like a novel by James, however, then it’s most like The Spoils of Poynton, cleverly appropriating that book’s use of a coveted house and its treasures as an index to human character. Andrea is marked out as morally deficient during her very first visit to the Dutch House, when she singles out the portraits of the Van Hoebeeks to Cyril for praise: “‘It must be a comfort, having them with you,’ Andrea said to him, not of his children but of his paintings.’” Like a Jamesian villain, she prefers art to life.James said that the house of fiction has “not one window, but a million”, depending on who is looking at the scene, and Patchett’s elegantly constructed narrative often reads like a dramatisation of this idea. For years after they are banished from the Dutch House, Maeve and Danny make a ritual of parking outside their former home to watch the comings and goings of Andrea and their stepsisters through its vast windows. “Do you think it’s possible to ever see the past as it actually was?” asks Danny, now in college, where Maeve forces him to endure years of expensive medical training simply to drain the educational fund that would otherwise devolve to Andrea’s daughters. “We look back through the lens of what we know now,” he decides, “so we’re not seeing it as the people we were, we’re seeing it as the people we are, and that means the past has been radically altered.” The glass-walled Dutch House may be open to view, but the truth it contains is obscured.As the layers of the past are rolled away, the shocks keep coming. Vanished fairytale mothers have a habit of reappearing at critical times, and so it is with self-denying Elna, “the little sister of the poor, the assemblage of bones and tennis shoes”. In spite of her frailty, she is a truly monstrous creation, dispensing charity with the ruthless impartiality of a saint, offering her love and presence to all except her own family. The other characters don’t get off lightly either. Cyril is revealed as weak and neglectful, a man who never really liked children, even his own. And if Maeve is a substitute mother then she’s in some ways as compromised a figure as Elna and Andrea, demanding her own relentless form of sacrifice in the guise of Danny’s medical studies. Having carried out his sister’s revenge against their stepmother by qualifying as a doctor, he refuses to practise medicine. Like art, healing is not for everyone.Except that, in the world of The Dutch House, it almost is. It’s a rare Patchett novel that ends without the slightest glimmer of redemption, and here the major players virtually all – as in a story by James – arrive at final positions that involve an ironic inversion of where they started. Danny’s eventual accommodation of the past, and of his family’s choices, seems both inevitable and earned. “The point wasn’t whether or not I liked it,” he admits. “The point was it had to be done.” And besides, by middle age he “had the idea that all of the hard things had already happened”: as always, Patchett leads us to a truth that feels like life rather than literature.• Elizabeth Lowry’s Dark Water is published by Riverrun.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.Let’s open with a bang, as safereturndoubtful recommends Smonk by Tom Franklin:Smonk opens with a real bang, the first four chapters are amongst the most savage and grotesque as I have read in fiction. It’s 1911 in Alabama and EO Smonk and Evavangeline, both thoroughly despicable characters, are running amok on separate paths of destruction, sharing some bit characters in their storylines, but otherwise remaining oblivious of each other’s existence as they move toward the day of reckoning… Alone, as a blood-bath western this would have limited appeal, but with the imagery created by his terse character descriptions and his deft application of black humour make it stand-out as an outstanding work in the southern gothic genre.Death in Captivity by Michael Gilbert has inspired Kincaid to make a “major shout-out for the British Library’s crime series”:Just a few more pages to go with Someone (a snitch?) is found dead in an uncompleted escape tunnel in an Italian prison camp. Who did it? The Allies are in Sicily. When will they invade Italy, and where? Will the Germans show up in the POW camp? So many what will happens when.My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite has won over jimitron5000:There were a couple of things, namely the garish green on the cover and the positive review by a bookseller whose tastes seem diametrically opposed to mine, that told me I shouldn’t like it. But I did, I really enjoyed it. Although the title suggests plenty of murder in the book, it more an exploration of family loyalty and sisterly binds. Punchy and sprinkled with humour, it is a good quick read.JG Farrell’s Singapore Grip is “marvellous, as you would expect from this author,” writes SydneyH:The main thing I’ll take from it is the foolhardiness of engaging in war with Germany and Japan simultaneously, the two countries most likely to be extremely competent and efficient at it – though there obviously wasn’t much choice in the matter. After the strike on America’s fleet in Pearl Harbour, Japan were in control of the Asia Pacific, and there wasn’t much that Britain, Australia and India could do about it, especially after key battleships were sunk. The bombing of Singapore is something I was not familiar with, so it was all very interesting. If the novel isn’t quite as satisfying as Troubles, it’s probably because of the emphasis on the economic pressures that led to the tensions in the region. Also, I felt that the ending left too many tales unfinished.Pseudaletia is persevering with The Flounder by Gunter Grass:… A book I have started twice but never got past about page five. I dug it out, and I think this time it has ‘taken’. I really enjoy the mix of real and surreal. I’m not far enough into it to talk about it’s meaning, etc, but so far it’s entertaining and thoughtful.We Don’t Die of Love by Stephen May has won over pubbore:A lovely little book about masculinity in crisis. A man pushing 60 struggles to find a purpose after his wife leaves and he finds his business under threat. A bit like Nick Hornby, if he wrote about older working class men in the post-industrial north - sad, real, ultimately hopeful.Vasily Grossman’s Stalingrad is “very long” says paulburns, but that “doesn’t matter”:It’s a stunning achievement, one of the great literary masterpieces to come out of Russia in the twentieth century. Through the lives of several families, (not just the Shaposhnikovs, for those of you who have read Life and Fate ) and various iniduals, Grossman tells the story of the opening stages of the Battle for Stalingrad and its effect on the whole of Soviet society. His scope is epic and for the most part, transcends the limits of Socialist Realism imposed on him by the cultural elite. A lot of my pleasure came from how I was surprised by how Grossman portrayed events (and I thought I knew the battle of Stalingrad pretty well) so I’m refusing to engage in a series of spoilers. Read and enjoy. Delight! In a strange way it might make some weeks of this terrible year easier to bear.Finally, Vesca has just finished Robinson by the great Muriel Spark:It’s not as dark than others of hers I’ve read, which may be because it’s only her second book. Our heroine wakes up on a privately owned island after a plane crash. She and two very different men are the only survivors. Other than that there’s only a young boy and the owner and resident, Robinson. But who is Robinson?Now I want to know too.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

That double blow came just days after Northern Irish businessman Darren Donnelly also withdrew from making a potential bid for the firm.The accounting group Deloitte, which had been running the sales auction for the company, is understood to have been lined up as an administrator. Sources close to Wrights Group, the company behind Wrightbus, indicated that an announcement concerning its administration would likely be made on Wednesday morning.Wrightbus, which was founded in 1946 as Robert Wright \u0026amp Son Coachbuilders and began life working on lorries, has been struggling with its finances for months and made two rounds of redundancies last year with 95 jobs going in February and June.It had some recent successes in selling its products, including a Transport for London (TfL) order for 20 brand new hydrogen-powered buses, which cost around £500,000 each and only emit water as exhaust in May.However, Johnson’s successor as mayor, Sadiq Khan, cancelled further purchases of the New Routemasters in 2016 and the company’s finances came increasingly under pressure as the UK bus market slowed.Bus operators had ordered a large number of vehicles in recent years to meet new emissions standards, but have now taken a cautious approach to new orders.The collapse of Harland and Wolff is just the latest blow to manufacturing in Northern Ireland, under pressure from firms offering cheaper labour costs abroad and weak economic environment.Multiple factories have closed there in recent years, with fears of more to come if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.The manufacturing sector is disproportionately large in Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the UK. A study from Oxford Economics found it accounts for about a third of the economy, compared to only a tenth of the overall UK output.The same study suggests that the sector supports 214,000 jobs directly and indirectly, or a quarter of all employment.Much of Northern Ireland’s manufacturing – from linen to shipbuilding – has fallen prey to the same forces of globalisation faced by the rest of the UK. Added to that is the new threat of a no-deal Brexit.The government’s own forecasts suggest a no-deal Brexit could lead to a sharp rise in unemployment, with at least 40,000 jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure. Many of those jobs will be focused in manufacturing, heavily reliant on frictionless exports across the Irish border.In its last set of accounts, for the 12 months to December 2017, Wrights Group made sales of £227m and a profit of £1.5m – figures down from £264m and £10.7m from the year before. The financial position of the company is thought to have deteriorated significantly since the last financial update.Before the potential bidders pulled out of talks last week, the company had raised staff hopes that a deal was imminent. On Thursday, Wrightbus management told employees it was “now in a race to complete a final deal with credible bidders”.It added: “This ongoing business and its employees are our number one priority and we are confident that a positive outcome can be delivered over the next few days.”On Tuesday, Wrights Group said it did not have anybody available to comment. Deloitte declined to comment too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a15a22e148defc5a980551f92098c299f9dee89/0_198_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39c328b33af7c1739f17da108335f642","title":"try before you buy german city offers workers a free one month stay","story":"Picturesque Görlitz is offering free lodging and studio space in exchange for feedback on what potential residents want from a cityLast year Eva Bodenmüller read about a city in eastern Germany inviting people to live there for a month for free. She and her partner Carsten Borck, an artist, knew they had to leave their residence in Italy soon and weren’t looking forward to moving back to their native Berlin.“I thought: ‘Why not Görlitz?’” said Bodenmüller, a freelance journalist .Görlitz, Germany’s easternmost city, is a well-preserved gem that has played the part of quaint Mitteleuropean burg in Hollywood films from The Grand Budapest Hotel to Inglourious Basterds to The Reader. But its pastel-coloured old town, which draws 140,000 tourists a year, hides a darker reality.City officials decided they needed to do something to reverse this trend, and hit upon the idea of offering a free one-month stay, no strings attached.Other cities had already been experimenting with the idea of luring new residents by offering to cover their housing. Detroit was the first big city to try it, launching an innovative programme of paying promising young professionals to live and work in the city for a year, and today the idea is being used everywhere from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela, Italy, and Tulsa, Oklahoma, which offers $10,000 to digital workers to move there for a year.The proportion of workers who conduct their business remotely is growing. Already, millions of people spend much of their adult lives hopscotching from one place to another, perhaps including the occasional work-tourism visit to Medellín or Tokyo. The officials behind Görlitz’s programme figured it could both attract some of those nomadic workers and give them the chance to learn some lessons on how to reverse its population decline.“When we applied we thought the project was about convincing people to move to Görlitz,” Borck said over borscht at a restaurant overlooking the Neisse River. “But now we have the feeling it doesn’t matter whether we stay here after these four weeks or not. We’re just the laboratory mice for this science experiment.”The Görlitz-based Interdisciplinary Centre for Ecological and Revitalising Urban Transformation (IZS), which is overseeing Testing the City, as the federally funded project is known, received more than 150 applications. Two-thirds were from larger cities, and several came from outside Germany, including from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the US and the UK.The 54 iniduals and groups participating are singles, couples and families ranging from their 20s to 60s, including digital entrepreneurs, a film-maker, a model, visual artists and musicians. Each is assigned to one of three project-maintained apartments and offered free use of one of three spaces for work.Though the municipality hopes that some will permanently relocate to Görlitz, the main intention is for ISZ to use participant interviews and questionnaires to inform a national urban development policy to help revive Germany’s smaller cities. “Our aim is to learn more about what people need, and if they move, what is their motivation,” said IZS head Robert Knippschild.Görlitz is a fascinating place to test these theories. The city has around 7,000 vacant apartments, and unemployment is a third higher than the national average. This, in part, is why Görlitz has taken in 1,200 refugees. But surveys have shown immigration to be the most urgent issue for residents of eastern Germany, where the far right has taken hold.“It was a tough campaign,” said Ursu, a Romanian immigrant who played lead trumpet in the local philharmonic orchestra before turning to politics. He says he wants to put the animosity of the election in the past, and sees Testing the City as part of a budding revival which includes a new data analysis centre employing 120 scientists and engineers, a Siemens hydrogen technologies innovation campus that will employ another 100, and a €36m (£32m) facelift for the art nouveau municipal hall.Ursu believes the key to creating jobs is a more welcoming society. “I’ve said to the people, you must think about whether you want to have an open city, a European city, or a closed city,” he said.This is not a settled question in Görlitz. A July report on the project by the German news outlet Deutsche Welle attracted sharp comments online. “The incentive to lure you here is just the desperate attempt of our city to fight the shrinking population,” said YouTube user Polter Geist. “They hope your leftwing alternative garbage will appeal to the youth.”During their stay, Bodenmüller and Borck have sought to engage with these issues directly. Borck staged a show of his work at the Europa Haus gallery, with posters asking passersby questions such as “Am I welcome here?” and “How do I know you are not a Nazi?”.The couple said they spent a lot of time talking to locals and found a city of extremes. “In other places you generally have people from different groups talking to each other,” said Bodenmüller, who has lived in Berlin, Munich and several smaller towns. “But here there is no centre – there are just the two sides.”Another project participant, Nikolas Kammerer, 34, a photographer from Leipzig, sees the locals as one of the city’s main draws. He found it refreshing that artists and creative workers in Görlitz are not looking to become YouTube stars or Instagram influencers, but instead are laser-focused on producing and collaborating. He credits his month in the city for his first successful commission for the German news outlet Die Zeit: a portrait series of local voters on election day. “In Leipzig I probably wouldn’t have done this,” he said.He also saw the other perspective, at a far-right election rally where the AfD candidate denounced foreigners as criminals and the crowd chanted “Lugen Presse!” (“lying press!”). “It was horrible,” said Kammerer, whose grandmother is from Görlitz. “Most of these far-right people don’t want to talk to the media, which is a problem because I want to have them represented in my work.”With the project about halfway through, four participants have committed to move to Görlitz, including German-Finnish poet Mark Mallon and his wife, Finnish artist Venla Saalo. The couple decided to leave Berlin because of its traffic, pollution and high rents, and settled in Görlitz in April. “Görlitz feels like a lively town with a lot of young people, students, opportunities, empty spaces, and on the other hand peace and remoteness,” they said. “It is a great combination for creative work.”Borck and Bodenmüller like the cheap rents and high density of organic grocery stores and vegetarian restaurants but wish Görlitz had better regional transport and more open-mindedness. They also wished they had more time there.“It’s very intense, to try to meet people, learn the city and do our work in just four weeks,” said Bodenmüller. “If we could stay here longer, we could leave and come back and have a better chance to understand the city.”Knippschild’s early conclusions from the pilot project suggest that cultural offerings and leisure activities are crucial to attracting nomadic workers, as are reliable travel connections and good housing.“People are taking the project seriously, thinking about which phase of life they are in and what they need in terms of housing and living,” he said of the participants. “This is giving us a great deal of insight into the strengths and weaknesses of Görlitz.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/190fb0f79c724945e7c21a2caa34aca1a4161df2/0_19_6444_3866/master/6444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e69db4a7ae90a3daf14079422bdfc7d7","title":"benjamin netanyahu israel palestinians government","story":"In my hometown of Tira, an Arab community in central Israel, word spread on election day last week of many residents deciding to vote at the last minute. During the campaign’s final weeks, families watched as the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu launched ferocious tirades about the threat of a “leftist-Arab government”. He told his followers the Arabs “want to annihilate us all”, and that they were “stealing” the elections through rampant voter fraud (his legislative attempts to place surveillance cameras at Arab polling stations failed to get through the Knesset).Tira’s residents were no strangers to the prime minister’s history of racist incitement, but for many people his shocking escalations compelled a response. If they couldn’t stop him from winning, they thought, they would at least try to make his job as difficult as possible.Traditionally, Arab parties have refused to nominate an Israeli prime minister – their last recommendation was for Yitzhak Rabin in 1992, who went on to sign the Oslo accords with Yasser Arafat’s Palestine Liberation Organization. But in a historic and controversial move on Sunday, Ayman Odeh, the head of the Joint List, formally recommended to President Reuven Rivlin that Benny Gantz, leader of the centre-right Blue and White party, be appointed to form the next government. Only one of the List’s factions, the nationalist party Balad, withheld its support. Had Odeh declined to nominate Gantz, the task was more likely to be assigned to Netanyahu again. (At Rivlin’s urging, the two leaders have now begun talks about forming a unity government.)These surprising developments have been praised as major steps towards “integrating” Palestinian citizens into national politics and reigniting the opposition to increasingly hard-right rule. But such claims are seriously flawed. Like much of Israeli politics over the past decade, the value placed on Palestinian voting power has been centred almost exclusively on one issue: ousting Netanyahu. There has been little engagement in Israel or abroad with the community’s larger policy concerns, which include stopping home demolitions and land seizures, eradicating gun violence in Arab towns, revoking dozens of discriminatory laws and ending the occupation of the Palestinian territories. And yet as the Palestinian writer and feminist activist Samah Salaime put it, the Israeli centre-left now thinks that it is the responsibility of Palestinians “to take Bibi down – as second-class citizens, but first-class voters”.This narrow narrative, which the Joint List itself often resorts to, reduces Palestinian citizens to pawns in a competition between Jewish political elites, whose differences have more to do with personality than policy. It’s not just that Blue and White’s platform mirrors Likud in nearly all but name: Gantz and his partner, Yair Lapid, have repeatedly derided the Joint List as extremists who don’t represent their constituents, and have rejected the conditions put forward by Odeh for backing Gantz’s candidacy – conditions ranging from recognising dozens of Bedouin villages in the Negev to cancelling the Jewish nation-state law, which reflect the basic needs and rights of Palestinian citizens. “Centre-left” Zionist parties, such as the Democratic Union and Labour-Gesher, have also shifted rightwards in many of their positions: the two-state solution, once the centre-left’s flagship agenda, is no longer a priority.Given this ide, Arab parties usually prefer to stay out of the Jewish majority’s leadership battles. But with today’s competing blocs neck-and-neck, with Palestinian national politics severely fragmented and with Palestinian citizens demanding results from their infighting leaders, the Joint List found itself between a rock and a hard place.Removing Netanyahu and disrupting the rightwing’s decade-long hold on power could provide many strategic benefits to Palestinian citizens – a path that appears to be endorsed by most of the community, who are feeling the brunt of the government’s increasingly harmful policies. But to do this, they must back Gantz, a former army chief who boasted of bombing Gaza “back to the stone age”, and who declared that he would only sit with coalition partners who were “Jewish and Zionist” – echoing the racist politics of the very rival he is trying to depose. Palestinians are damned if the List steps away and allows Netanyahu’s return, and they are damned if it steps in and offers Gantz a path to power.By opting for the latter, the List has taken a gamble that is already polarising Palestinian opinion, and which could backfire devastatingly if a unity government is formed. Regardless of what unfolds, the obsession with Netanyahu’s fate must shift to the bigger problem at the heart of Israeli politics. Despite differing ideologies, Palestinian citizens remain united around a core political consensus: full equality and social justice for all, and an end to the military occupation. These pillars – which would be basic values in any other part of the world – are still viewed by most Jewish-Israeli parties and voters as uncomfortable at best and an existential threat at worst. That makes the Joint List, despite its numerous flaws, the only truly progressive party in Israel.But as long as Israel’s “democracy” is predicated on accepting racial primacy and disenfranchising millions, it won’t matter how many parliamentary seats the List can muster – its “first-class voters” will remain second-class citizens.• Amjad Iraqi is a contributing editor at +972 Magazine and a policy analyst at Al-Shabaka"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6699fafcbe63c373f35b9301b12a73fd257f0107/0_136_4047_2427/master/4047.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeec5d1c1bdad152322cfd37ab118ac8","title":"greta thunberg showed the world what it means to lead","story":"The climate activist from Sweden was the star of the UN climate summit. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look likeAt the 2019 annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations, a 16-year-old climate activist took the mantle of global leadership usually reserved for the US president.Donald Trump’s decision to not participate in the UN climate summit illustrated just how devastatingly Trump’s climate-denying policies have undermined America’s role in the world as a force for good, and how his actions could contribute to the destruction of the futures of countless billions. Meanwhile, Greta Thunberg called him – and other world leaders – out for their malign neglect in failing to address the single most existential threat humanity faces, while revealing the energy with which a new generation of leaders is determined to act.Each year, leaders come to New York and remind us of the promise of the United Nations – the notion that the international community can work together to solve shared challenges. The meetings can also showcase the ability of US leadership to encourage countries to tackle serious threats. These gatherings can yield genuine results – commitments to tackle a pandemic like Ebola, for instance. Whether crafting solutions to pressing challenges or inspiring the world to act, UNGA can remind us how much America can achieve when it leads and works together with partners.Not this year. Of course, Trump’s mere presence is more than enough to sap the power of American diplomacy on the world’s greatest diplomatic stage, and this year Trump again came ready to embarrass himself – and America – by roaming the halls of the UN reminding the public that he attempted to force the president of Ukraine into investigating Joe Biden in a move that should be worthy of a unanimous impeachment conviction.And so, Trump refusing to participate in the UN climate summit was little surprise from a president who gutted domestic environmental protections, announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, and is even trying to prevent California from enacting higher emissions standards for automobiles.Enter 16-year-old Greta Thunberg. The climate activist from Sweden – who has helped spark a global movement of young people striking from school to press their leaders to urgently confront climate change – was the star of the show. Her remarks reminded us what leadership, courage and sacrifice look like.Speaking to the assembled world leaders, Thunberg outlined the stakes of inaction on climate change and denounced the world’s focus on “money and fairytales of eternal economic growth.” Thunberg made clear what’s coming: “You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal… We will not let you get away with this… The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.”Read all of what Thunberg said. Watch the passion – and the justified anger – in how she said it. Too many of the world’s leaders – political, corporate, civic – are collectively robbing the world’s youth of their futures. The lack of action means that young people like her have to sacrifice, Thunberg said: “This is all wrong. I shouldn’t be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words.”Thunberg’s sacrifice couldn’t find a stronger contrast than the selfishness of Trump, who only looks out for himself. His egotism was illustrated yet again when he mocked Thunberg’s speech.If politicians can’t find a way to act quickly and on a scale the likes of which the world has never seen in order to mitigate the effects of climate change, the student strikes and marches will pale in comparison to what we are likely to see in the future. If entire generations know as a scientific fact that earth will, in their lifetimes, become violently inhospitable to vast swathes of humanity, what kinds of actions would we expect them to take?Thunberg is right – change is coming. There are leaders of countries and businesses making commitments to tackle climate change. Local governments, like California, are trying to move ahead on their own when their countries abdicate their responsibility. And, as Thunberg exemplifies, younger generations are beginning to mobilize. One poll of US teenagers noted that roughly one in four people ages 13 to 17 have taken action – attended a protest, taken part in a walkout, written to an public official – to advocate for change in climate policy.But time is not on our side, and the longer that the actions of Trump and other leaders defending the use of fossil fuels are allowed to stand, the more catastrophic the results will be for our children.Tackling the climate crisis requires American leadership. America is by far the largest cumulative contributor of emissions since the industrial revolution and is currently the second largest emitter (after China). America has a responsibility to act the worst effects of climate change cannot be averted without US action, and Americans are already feeling the pain of the climate crisis.Furthermore, American leadership, when wielded the right way, can produce results. The United States has the unique ability to bring countries together on climate, as we saw when the US and China (the world’s largest current emitter) struck a deal that created the political momentum that led to the Paris agreement.The speech that Thunberg gave should be echoed by an American president and accompanied by sweeping actions to cut emissions. Unfortunately, right now, such an America lies dormant. In his annual UN speech, Trump yet again trumpeted his nationalist “America First” policies that do nothing but spurn the world. Trump has, for the time being, eviscerated the power of American leadership to do good.But Greta Thunberg and her generation are ready to lead and to sacrifice. The world’s youth won’t accept failure – they have no choice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58c107de385838e462c5c21d43fc81496f77264c/0_0_3186_1912/master/3186.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=070a8f0af6a12baee7ca272e4b4486c0","title":"the united states is now in uncharted waters","story":"The Democrats’ decision to begin impeachment proceedings has set the country on a course whose end is impossible to predictNancy Pelosi, the US House Speaker, might sympathize with the quote attributed to nineteenth-century French politician Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin: “There go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader.” For months following the release of the Mueller report, Pelosi had resisted pressure from within her caucus to begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. But now, with more than two-thirds of Democrats in the House of Representatives favoring impeachment in the wake of Trump’s Ukrainian scandal, she has reversed herself and announced a formal impeachment inquiry.Pelosi had objected to impeachment mainly for political reasons. She observed that the Mueller Report’s lengthy catalogue of Trump’s malefactions didn’t move public sentiment toward impeachment. She predicted that the Republican-dominated Senate would surely reject any articles of impeachment approved by the Democratic House, making the process appear to be merely partisan theater — a repeat of the 1998 impeachment proceedings mounted against President Bill Clinton by House Republicans, which ultimately backfired and led to Democratic gains in that year’s elections. And she pointed out that impeachment proceedings might jeopardize the moderate Democrats who won Republican-held districts in 2018, allowing the party to regain control of the House.But on September 23, a group of seven first-term Democrats from those very battleground districts — all of whom had served in the military or defense and intelligence agencies, and six of whom had previously opposed impeachment — wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post declaring that “If these allegations are true, we believe these actions represent an impeachable offense.” Perhaps Pelosi, like those seven representatives, changed her mind because of the gravity of the new allegations, but their reversal certainly undercut her pragmatic political case against impeachment. And the Trump administration’s stonewalling of congressional investigations and refusal to abide by long-established norms of political conduct weakened Pelosi’s argument that methods short of impeachment could determine the truth of the allegations.As a country, we now enter what the seven freshmen called “unchartered waters,” with an unprecedented political and constitutional crisis looming on the horizon. Impeachment proceedings could turn public opinion decisively against Trump, as with President Richard Nixon and Watergate, perhaps leading to Trump’s premature departure from the White House. It’s also possible that impeachment could backfire on the Democrats, costing them control of the House and enabling Trump’s reelection in 2020.If the latter scenario comes to pass, it may appear in hindsight that Pelosi’s caucus stampeded her into action against her better judgment. She had previously insisted that impeachment would require public support as well as backing from at least some Republicans. It’s too soon for polls to determine whether the latest revelations have shifted public opinion significantly, but so far only one Republican — Representative Justin Amash of Michigan — has called for Trump’s impeachment, and he quit the party soon afterwards.Chances are, however, that Pelosi is calculating that while impeachment will pour petrol on America’s already incendiary politics, Democrats stand to benefit from the conflagration. That’s largely because, unlike the Mueller report, the Ukrainian scandal involves what appear to be clear and comprehensible issues of corruption and threats to U.S. national security and the electoral process. Trump already has admitted that he attempted to pressure a foreign government to dig up dirt to use against his political opponent, Joe Biden, and he may also have withheld military aid appropriated by Congress as further leverage. We don’t yet know exactly what is in the whistleblower’s complaint, and perhaps there will be no definitive evidence of an aid-for-dirt quid pro quo. But Trump’s actions will be difficult for Republicans running in 2020 to defend or distance themselves from.The scandal likely will prove especially damaging in the suburban swing districts where Democrats won their House majority in 2018. Historically, the college-educated voters who predominate in such districts voted Republican because they considered it the party of stability and responsibility. There are many reasons why college-educated voters (particularly women) have been tilting against the Republicans in recent elections. But the Ukrainian scandal, however it plays out, will strengthen the sense among these voters that Trump considers himself to be above the law and constitutional restraints, and further erode the Republican party’s reputation as the law-and-order party. Undoubtedly this is why the statement issued by Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer emphasized that the decision to launch impeachment proceedings was “not a partisan matter, it’s about the integrity of our democracy, respect for the rule of law and defending our Constitution.”Looking ahead to the 2020 election, the Ukrainian scandal is likely to put many Republicans running in those battleground districts in an untenable position. If they agree that the president’s actions merit condemnation, they will alienate the ferociously pro-Trump Republican base, but if they run as Trump defenders they will lose the moderate majorities in those districts.The Democrats’ decision to begin impeachment proceedings has set the country on a course whose end is impossible to predict, but right now the political advantage seems to rest with Nancy Pelosi. In the wake of the Mueller report, she successfully prevented a drive toward impeachment that could have split the Democrats’ moderates and progressives.

There is currently no country in which travellers pay an escalating levy on each flight they take in a year.“In the absence of a true zero-carbon plane, demand cannot continue to grow unfettered over the long-term,” it stated.Emissions from international aviation are not currently included in national carbon budgets such as the UK’s but instead managed by a dedicated UN agency – the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, some have said the body is too secretive and close to industry to take on the major polluters.The CCC said international air travel should be included in the UK’s climate strategy like any other business sector.He argued that the UK should take a leading role in cutting emissions from the sector, rather than wait for more comprehensive international agreements to be struck.“There should be no barrier to bringing aviation emissions into the carbon budgets and then putting in place a set of policies that at some stage in the future will be compatible with those international agreements,” Stark said.A DfT spokesperson said: “Tackling climate change is one of the most urgent and pressing challenges that we face. Which is why this government has set a bold 2050 net zero target for the UK and a greener aviation industry will play a key role in that.“The government is funding the future of flight and have announced £5m in funding for new technologies like electric and autonomous aircraft to help us tackle climate change. We are working with our partners to ensure the government takes a leading role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e05fd230c77229f2f9ae3fb57d30850cef632f2/0_392_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33b4425e94458ff05884f87c63f890d","title":"judy film renee zellweger lip syncing singing","story":"As Judy Garland, Renée Zellweger delivers an all-singing tour de force and reminds us of the power of stars who can also sing their way through musicalsIn the golden age of Hollywood musicals, having your singing voice dubbed was seen as a bit of a cheat: it could be done, in some cases, but chances are you’d be marked down a bit for it. In 1965, George Cukor’s sumptuous version of the Broadway smash My Fair Lady won eight Oscars, including best actor for Rex Harrison, who manfully did his own speak-singing as Henry Higgins eyebrows were raised, however, when his co-star Audrey Hepburn wasn’t even nominated for best actress.The snub was seen as something of a punishment. Hepburn had been cast in the role in place of its less famous Broadway originator, Julie Andrews despite extensive vocal training on her part, however, she wasn’t considered a strong enough singer by studio bosses to tackle the lilting likes of I Could Have Danced All Night. Dubbed by the soprano and regular Hollywood ghost-singer Marni Nixon, Hepburn’s otherwise winsome performance was thus deemed a lesser achievement by her peers in a perfectly ironic twist, best actress that year went to Andrews’ note-perfect film debut in Mary Poppins instead. Perhaps Hepburn, outwardly gracious as ever, called Natalie Wood to vent: three years before, Nixon’s dubbing had also seemingly cost her an Oscar nomination when West Side Story otherwise ran the table.Half a century later, the form and fashion of the Hollywood musical has changed considerably, and so has the industry’s attitude toward actors who choose to hide behind others’ vocals: in an age where truly gifted song-and-dance performers are mostly confined to the stage, doing your own singing on screen is seen as an impressive but optional extra talent. Dubbing didn’t cost Rami Malek an Oscar earlier this year, for example: neither the public nor his industry admirers were bothered by the fact that he toothsomely lip-synced in the blockbuster Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.The fact that his fellow nominee Bradley Cooper did all his own gravelly singing as a fictional rock star in A Star is Born gave him no leg-up in the race, it turned out. Cooper merely looked on as Malek joined the ranks of actors to win armloads of awards for formidably transforming themselves into major musical figures while skimping on the singing part, including Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles and Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf. As the popular music biopic has largely replaced the straight-up musical in Hollywood’s genre affections, physical acting and emoting counts for more than holding a tune, and why should it not?Yet taking the harder route of eschewing dubbing – and, in particular, interpreting another artist’s immortal vocals – can yield rewards too. This year, Taron Egerton offered his own tuneful stab at the Elton John songbook in Rocketman his performance feels more organic and invested than Malek’s swaggering, surface-level Mercury for it. Sissy Spacek and Reese Witherspoon won Oscars for nailing the country-and-western timbre of Loretta Lynn and June Carter Cash, respectively Spacek’s crooning in Coal Miner’s Daughter, in particular, was so authentic it even netted her a country Grammy nomination. Meanwhile, as a soul music sensation making her film debut in the Billie Holiday biopic Lady Sings the Blues, you would hardly have expected Diana Ross to go the dubbed route, even if her high, silky voice sounded not a bit like Holiday’s the gritty spirit of her fine performance was felt, however, and she too was Oscar-nominated.It’s into this dedicated but less slavishly impersonation-based tradition that Renée Zellweger’s much-acclaimed performance in Judy falls. Though Zellweger has proven her capable chops in the musicals Chicago and My Own Love Song, she was never going to be a vocal ringer for the utterly singular, from-the-gut stylings of Judy Garland. Yet her decision to do her own singing pays off handsomely, not least because the film, set in the bumpy final year of Garland’s life, captures the showwoman at her most vocally damaged and erratic. Having Zellweger lip-sync to pristine Garland recordings would have been entirely inaccurate digging up archive footage of Garland at her worst for Zellweger to mime to, on the other hand, would have been simply ghoulish.As it is, Zellweger’s tour de force proves how – even as it comes at the expense of pure, eerie verisimilitude – having an actor literally find the voice of the person they’re playing can contribute invaluably to the very arc of a performance. She matches Garland’s tattered, liquor-soaked vocal stumbles early on, playing well beneath either woman’s ability by the time she reaches crisper, clearer notes, for a climactically redemptive onstage rendition of Over the Rainbow, the anxiety and labour that is audible in her voice feels so hard-earned, it hardly matters that she’s not reaching Garland’s highest peaks. The triumph belongs to the actor and character alike with respect to the most lauded of lip-syncers, that’s not a victory they know."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bbfc3e4e54c6eccae9559b88ee613a888e45aab/0_2270_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca63f123584df73df98b0e7bd750176f","title":"20 best easy autumn recipes yottam ottolenghi rory oconnell","story":"Yotam Ottolenghi’s comforting curried egg and cauliflower salad and Dan Lepard’s cinnamon cake – more of our favourite seasonal dishesThere is a great joy to be had from the mere mention of a chicken pie. A soft, yielding, delicious, not too onerous recipe that soothes and comforts always. It is always quite amusing whenever another filling is suggested, that everyone’s eyes turn down and they murmur: “But can’t it be chicken?” Invariably, it is chicken.Serves 6-8unsalted butter 125g celery 1 head, finely choppedcarrots 3, finely choppedleeks 2, finely choppedonions 3 small, finely choppedgarlic 2 cloves, finely choppedstreaky bacon 3 rashers, thinly slicedolive oil 6-8 tbsp chicken legs 6 white wine 1 bottle chicken stock 500ml thyme, marjoram and summer savory (if savory and marjoram prove elusive, simply up the thyme) 3 sprigs of each, tied in a posy with twine or bacon rindbay leaves 5 sea salt and freshly ground pepper to tasteflat-leaf parsley 2 tbsp, chopped lemon finely grated zest of ½rough or puff pastry 500gegg 1 milk a spoonfulHeat a wide, heavy bottomed pot, add in the butter and melt. Add in the chopped vegetables and bacon. Stir this well and place a lid on top, lifting to stir from time to time, and let the vegetables cook, steaming until soft and bright.Meanwhile, heat a wide frying pan, add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and fry the chicken legs until gently golden, then add them to the vegetables.Pour in the wine and stock, add the herb posy and bay leaves, season with salt and pepper, and place the lid atop and let cook for 45 minutes over the gentlest heat. When the meat is just cooked, turn off the heat and leave to cool, then lift the chicken out and carefully pick the meat from the bones and add back into the pot.Stir the pot of vegetables and chicken and taste for seasoning. Remove the bundle of herbs and the bay leaves. Add the chopped parsley and the finely grated zest of lemon. Mix all this together very well but not so much as to break the meat into smaller pieces.Heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4 and fill a handsome pie dish with the chicken and vegetables. Roll out the pastry to cover the dish, about 3-5mm thick. Top the dish with the pastry sheet. Crack the egg into a cup and beat with a fork and then add the milk, then brush liberally over the pastry. Use any offcuts to make a decoration, if you’re feeling creative.Bake the pie for 45 minutes until the top is golden brown and piping hot. A mighty bowl of parsley and mustard mash alongside, and a bowl of peas, are a fine accompaniment. Jeremy Lee is the chef-proprietor of Quo Vadis, London W1Pheasant is generally speaking, excellent value for money. The lean birds can be a little dry so I like to casserole-roast them, finding the result juicier, and with the addition of a few robust flavours, the bird is almost self-saucing.When buying a pheasant, choose the plumpest-looking bird. The addition of cinnamon may seem a little odd, but it adds a delicious scent to the cooking juices. The savoy cabbage puree can be made ahead of time and gently reheated later.Serves 2 savoy cabbage puree serves 4-6rind-less fat streaky bacon 100g olive oil 1 tbsp plump pheasant 1 red wine 150ml, eg cabernet sauvignontinned or bottled tomatoes 100g, finely choppedcinnamon stick ½ rosemary 1 sprig, about 6cm longsea salt and freshly ground black pepperbutter 25g (optional)For the savoy cabbage pureesavoy cabbage 1 head water 1.75 litres sea salt and freshly ground black pepperregular or double cream 25-40ml salted butter 25-40gPreheat the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Cut the bacon into fine lardons, about 3cm long and 5mm thick. Heat a heavy casserole on a gentle heat until quite hot. Add the olive oil and then the bacon, stirring it regularly with a wooden spoon and allowing it to become slightly crisp and golden. Remove from the casserole and leave to drain on kitchen paper.Dry the breast of the pheasant and place it, breast side down, in the fat remaining in the casserole. Cook gently until the breast is golden. Do not try to rush this stage of the recipe, otherwise you may burn the casserole, in which case the flavour of the sauce at the end will be spoiled. Remove the pheasant from the pan and pour off the excess fat. Replace the casserole on a low heat and add the wine, tomatoes, cinnamon, rosemary and bacon. Place the pheasant on top and season with salt and pepper. Place a piece of greaseproof paper and a tight-fitting lid on the casserole and cook in the oven for 1 hour.For the savoy cabbage puree, remove any damaged outside leaves from the cabbage. However, don’t remove any more of those nice green outside leaves than is necessary, as they are full of flavour and will give lovely bright green flecks to the finished puree. Place the cabbage on a chopping board and cut directly down through the middle of the head, then quarter and remove the hard core. Slice the cabbage against the grain, nice and thinly.Bring the water to the boil and salt well. Add the cabbage and cook uncovered at a simmer until it is just tender. Strain the cabbage well, reserving 100ml of the cooking water. In a blender or using a handheld blender, blend to a coarse puree, adding cream and butter as you see fit. The consistency should be like that of a soft mashed potato. If the puree is a bit firm, add a little of the reserved cooking water to soften it and blend briefly again. Taste and correct the seasoning and serve in a hot dish. A non-stick pan is perfect for reheating it, and a little of the reserved cooking water can be used if the puree has thickened in the meantime.When the bird is cooked, remove the casserole from the oven and reduce the temperature to 100Cgas mark ¼. Put the pheasant on a dish, cover it with greaseproof paper, and put it back into the oven to keep warm. Place the casserole on a gentle heat and bring the juices to a simmer. Taste and decide if the liquid needs to reduce a little to concentrate the flavour. If it already tastes delicious, you are ready to go. I sometimes swirl a little butter into the juices at this stage, just to give the sauce a little more body – however, the sauce should not become too thick and strong.Carve the pheasant neatly and serve with the bubbling sauce and the savoy cabbage puree.From Master It: How to Cook Today by Rory O’Connell (Fourth Estate, £16.99)This is one of the lightest cakes you’ll make with wholemeal flour, but it depends on both beating the eggs to a thick froth and adding a little baking powder. The cake freezes well unfilled so you could bake in advance and wait till the berries look just right.Serves 6-8eggs 4 medium, at room temperaturecaster sugar 200g golden syrup 50g wholemeal flour 150g baking powder ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon 2 tsp cold milk 100ml double cream a small tub blackberries 1 punnet, or blackberry jamicing sugar for dustingLine the base and sides of a deep 20cm round cake tin with non-stick baking paper, and heat the oven to 180Cgas mark 4. Beat the eggs with the sugar and syrup using the whisk attachment on an electric mixer, until pale and thick and the mixture falls like thick ribbons when the beaters are lifted from the bowl. Sift the wholemeal flour, baking powder and cinnamon once, adding back any bran that the sieve collects. Add the milk to the beaten eggs and whisk, then add the flour and whisk once more until just smooth. Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake in the centre of the oven for 35 minutes, covering the top of the cake with foil for the last 10 minutes if you need to stop it from burning. When a skewer inserted comes out with just a few tiny moist crumbs stuck to it, remove from the oven and leave to cool. Whip the cream lightly, halve the blackberries, then slice the cake into 2 layers and fill with cream and fruit, reassemble the cake and dust lightly with icing sugar or top with extra whipped cream and blackberries.From Short and Sweet by Dan Lepard (Fourth Estate, £25)This is what coronation chicken would taste like if you replaced the chicken with cauliflower and hard-boiled egg. An introduction which possibly makes no sense until you eat it for yourself. If you are missing the chicken side of the equation, then you could do worse than serve this with said bird, roasted on the weekend.Serves 4-6cauliflower 1 medium (500g), trimmed and broken into 3-4cm florets keeping the tender leaves onion 1 (180g), cut into 1cm thick wedges olive oil 2 tbsp mild curry powder 1 tbsp salt and black pepperlarge eggs 9 Greek-style yogurt 100g mayonnaise 50g Aleppo chilli flakes 1 tsp (or ½ tsp regular chilli flakes)cumin seeds 1 tsp, toasted and roughly crushedlemons 2 – 1 squeezed to get 1 tbsp juice and the second cut into 4-6 wedges, to servetarragon 10g, roughly choppedTurn the oven to its highest setting. Mix the cauliflower florets (with any young leaves attached) in a large bowl with the onion, oil, 2 teaspoons of curry powder, ¾ teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Once combined, spread out on a large parchment-lined baking tray and roast for 15 minutes, until soft and golden-brown but still retaining a bite. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.Fill a medium pan with plenty of water and bring to the boil on a high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-high, then carefully lower in the eggs and boil gently for 10 minutes, until hard-boiled.Drain the eggs, then return them to the same pan filled with running cold water to stop them cooking.Once cool, peel the eggs, place them in a large bowl and break them roughly with the back of a fork to form large chunks.In a separate small bowl, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, the remaining 1 teaspoon of curry powder, half the Aleppo chilli flakes, the cumin, the lemon juice and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Add the sauce to the eggs, along with the cauliflower and onion and the tarragon. Mix together well, spoon the mixture on to a large plate, then sprinkle over the remaining chilli flakes and serve, along with the lemon wedges.From Ottolenghi Simple by Yotam Ottolenghi (Ebury Press, £25)I normally eat these deeply savoury baked onions as a side-dish to cold roast beef, and that is probably when they are at their best. But today I have them with a plainly roasted chicken (butter, salt and pepper and a few herbs tucked inside, roasted at 180Cgas mark 4 for 60 minutes till juicy and golden) and it is quite one of the most splendid meals I can remember. Frugal, too, as there is cold chicken left for tomorrow.Serves 4onions 4 medium to large oneswhipping or double cream 300mlgrated parmesan a good handfulSet the oven at 180Cgas mark 4. Peel the onions and bring them to the boil in a deep pot of water. Leave them at a bright simmer for about 25 minutes, until tender. Lift them out with a draining spoon. Slice the onions in half from root to tip and put them cut-side down in an ovenproof dish. Tip the cream over the onions. Season with salt, pepper and the grated cheese and bake for 25-30 minutes, till golden and bubbling.From The Kitchen Diaries by Nigel Slater (Fourth Estate, £30)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63088881ac89358798d9f0e13b64e26f2172d0bc/0_211_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e36410b531a62940c727934c83e0a085","title":"uk supermarket sales of north sea cod may stop next year","story":"MSC certificate to be suspended in October after dramatic fall in populationsSustainably caught North Sea cod could disappear from UK supermarket shelves next year after it was announced that certification is being suspended following a dramatic decline in populations.Cod populations in the sea had been thought to be in good health but the latest scientific advice has revealed much lower amounts of fish, putting the fishery at increased risk of collapse.MSC certification, which allows seafood and fish products to carry the label that shows it comes from sustainable fisheries, will be suspended from all MSC-certified fisheries targeting North Sea cod from 24 October.The news deals a blow to the fishing industry, which has introduced measures to avoid catching young fish, such as closing large spawning areas to fishing, trialling new nets, and avoiding areas where cod congregate to avoid catching them when fishing for other species.The loss of certification will mean that it will be harder to sell the cod to UK supermarkets, although that will also depend on what quotas are eventually agreed for the fishery.Erin Priddle, the UK and Ireland programme director for the MSC, said: “The decline in the North Sea cod stock is a worrying development, with the latest stock models suggesting that the fishery has not recovered as well as previously thought.”The latest scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) meant the North Sea cod fishery no longer met the MSC standard, she said. “While this news is devastating for industry, it is a testament to the MSC standard working as it should: to pick up on threats to stock sustainability, as is the case with North Sea cod.”The fishery won its sustainability certification in 2017, when populations were assessed as reaching 152,207 tonnes – the highest since 1982 and a decade since they came close to collapse.Populations were forecast to hit 180,990 tonnes in 2018, but the scientific advice for that year included a far smaller estimate of the amount of cod in the North Sea. This year’s advice from the ICES revealed estimates of only 81,224 tonnes, below the “safe biological level” for the population and putting it at increased danger of collapse.Chris Thorne, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “The MSC withdrawing North Sea cod’s sustainability certificate reflects what we already knew: our cod, like our oceans, are in crisis. Industrial over-fishing has driven stocks of cod in the North Sea to the point of collapse again, but despite this governments continue to ignore the science and allow overfishing to continue.”Aoife Martin, the director of operations at Seafish, the organiser of the annual national fish and chip awards, said: “North Sea cod is still a sustainably managed fishery and fishermen can still catch it within the agreed limits, there will just be less of it available to buy. The decision to reduce the allowed catch is a great example of responsible fisheries management.”Try to buy fish with MSC labels. Sustainable choices include:• Cod from Iceland or Norway.• Haddock.• Hake.• Pollock.• Pacific cod."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb55e69f1deb5b217bb9b7092ec281a5e893d374/0_111_1967_1180/master/1967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff1140a68782a6843bf3be5513a5dca1","title":"arsenal nottingham forest carabao cup match report","story":"Total control, an absence of alarms in any form, and enough positives to suggest more nights of this clarity might lie ahead. This was such a dominant, sleek victory that it must have felt as if it was happening to another football club but Arsenal are entitled to ascribe it some longer-term significance. On another occasion the return of Héctor Bellerín, who was roared on to the pitch as a substitute and promptly set up their third goal with his first contribution after nine months out, might have been the obvious good news story but this time it was difficult to know where to start.Provisions must be made for the fact Nottingham Forest, distracted by a Championship promotion campaign that resumes on Friday, were present in little more than name. But there were visions of Arsenal as they might yet be. They have missed the composure of Rob Holding, sidelined for a similar period to Bellerín, but saw him rise confidently on his first appearance since December for the header that doubled their lead.A fit Kieran Tierney might well have illuminated the season’s early weeks and now, on his debut, he could be seen tearing up the left flank and delivering a stream of smart crosses. Gabriel Martinelli, who scored their first and last goals, looks an outstanding prospect at centre-forward while Joe Willock suggested further what we already know: that there are few 20-year-old midfielders with comparable potential in English football.“It was a good result and we can be positive that we have different options for different matches,” Unai Emery said. Martinelli, who is 18, looks a serious one. Arsenal’s young recruits from South America have often disappeared after being subjected to obscure loan spells but there is something different about the Brazilian, who careered on to an excellent volleyed cross from Calum Chambers to thud in the opener and then curled a deflected fifth at the end.“He deserves it,” Emery said. “He has worked and trained with big spirit and a big performance.” Martinelli showed impressive strength and footwork throughout. Willock, who has a happy knack of arriving in threatening areas, stood out too and was the beneficiary of Bellerín’s overlap and centre in the 77th minute. With a moment like that, it was as if the Spain international had never been away Emery said he had wanted to play the entire 90 minutes but must be patient, with Monday’s game at Manchester United also likely to be too soon for a start.Not to worry: Chambers, an unexpected success as stand-in right-back against Aston Villa on Sunday, shone again in that position and then switched flanks upon Bellerín’s introduction, subsequently setting up a finish on the stretch from Reiss Nelson for number four. He must have felt far from view during last season’s loan with a desperate Fulham but, at 24, looks ready to contribute if he can nail down a position.That is a debate for another day. The only semblance of a cloud for Arsenal on this one was the first-half departure of Emile Smith Rowe, who went off on a stretcher as a precaution after taking a blow to the head. Even Mesut Özil’s wheeling-out as captain, which could have been pored over if things had gone differently, generally escaped scrutiny.“I think the game for us in 90 minutes was very consistent,” Emery concluded and, if that becomes a familiar refrain, expectations of Arsenal may have to be adjusted yet again."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07a9f90f1a7e872eff9061693822e8ac902c390/35_0_3416_2050/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e6982c0888614e4b534aaa6fabc62e2","title":"colchester tottenham carabao cup match report","story":"Eric Dier summed it up best after a goalless 90 minutes, telling his teammate Victor Wanyama that it had been an embarrassing performance from Tottenham. But their misery was only just beginning. They were out of the Carabao Cup before long, beaten 4-3 on penalties by Colchester United, whose giantkilling exploits left a subdued Mauricio Pochettino wondering when his underperforming side will rediscover their sense of unity.There was little intensity when it mattered from Spurs, who were toothless in attack after giving Harry Kane the night off, and Pochettino knew this was not a good look for last season’s Champions League finalists. He bemoaned the lack of aggression that meant they created few chances against the team sitting 10th in League Two and admitted that it will take time for his players to shake themselves out of their funk.This humbling defeat felt too familiar for Spurs, who are winless in their first five away games this season, and it was alarming to hear Pochettino suggest that there are too many different agendas in his squad. He is clearly still not over the frustrations of the summer, when the north Londoners failed to make all the signings he wanted and unhappy players such as Christian Eriksen, Danny Rose, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen ended up staying put.“We talked a lot in pre-season,” Pochettino said. “I knew it would be a tough situation. When you have an unsettled squad you always need time to recover the time you lose. That’s where we are. Maybe performances are good but we need this mental connection, this energy to be all together, not to have different agendas in the squad. We need time again to build that togetherness.”Could the January transfer window bring more uncertainty? “We are working hard,” insisted Pochettino. “January is a good opportunity to try to fix this type of situation. Then the next transfer window. That’s the problem when something happens you cannot control. I’m more than happy, it means we are human. To keep successful in football you need to be different every season.”At least there was some belated positivity from Pochettino after misses from Eriksen and Lucas Moura in the shootout. Perhaps he had remembered that lifting the gloom is his responsibility. “Today wasn’t a problem with energy or effort or commitment,” the manager added. “When you are nearly all perfect but don’t score it’s because of something you lack in the last third. But I am happy. The way we are going to change the dynamic is by working the way we worked today.”Spurs, who have won two of their first eight games in all competitions, were unimpressive in the final third. Their best chance during the first half fell to the lacklustre Dele Alli, who shot too close to Dean Gerken in the Colchester goal after meeting a cross from Oliver Skipp, and they found it hard to service Troy Parrot. The 17-year-old striker was quiet on his debut.“A great night under the lights,” said John McGreal, Colchester’s manager. “We knew that we had to change it. We knew that we had to get the extra man in midfield. We knew that, if we went to try and press, we’d get popped around.”McGreal’s side, who travel to Macclesfield Town in the league at the weekend, defended well and Spurs were reduced to appealing unsuccessfully for a penalty when Alli claimed he had been shoved by Paris Cowan-Hall. There was also a scare for the underdogs when Kyle Walker-Peters struck the far post with a cross-shot from the right.That was as close as Spurs came and it felt like a moral victory for McGreal when Pochettino threw on Son Heung-min and Eriksen in the 66th minute. Colchester had blunted Spurs, who needed more incision from Skipp and Wanyama in midfield.Penalties beckoned and the crowd roared when Gerken began the shootout by saving from Eriksen. The atmosphere dipped when Paulo Gazzaniga saved Jevani Brown’s dismal attempt at a Panenka but Colchester had a chance to win it after Moura struck the bar.Tom Lapslie stepped up and hammered the decisive kick past Gazzaniga, sparking a pitch invasion from the home fans. “We keep working to find a solution,” Pochettino said. “It’s about staying clear and fresh and calm. We only need time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b126d9f418bcdedea6eb3062e9312b3bfc0c2188/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84417204746861b866609b3dffe60618","title":"portsmouth southampton carabao cup match report","story":"Forty minutes after the final whistle the 1,981 delirious away supporters continued to serenade the victorious Southampton players and their manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl. “Four-nil, in your own backyard” was the haunting, whirring retort on repeat from those fans crammed into the Milton End after a first-half double by Danny Ings set Southampton for their first win here since 1984, before Cédric Soares and Nathan Redmond lashed home to seal victory in an electric derby.The atmosphere was feverish long before Mike Oldfield’s Portsmouth song filled the terraces of this rickety stadium but in the end the chasm between these sides – 50 places in the league pyramid – was explicitly clear, with a clinical Southampton side profiting where Portsmouth tried and failed John Marquis clipped a post, Brett Pitman forced Alex McCarthy into a save and Christian Burgess stabbed wide but Southampton ultimately sauntered to victory after a sluggish start. Hasenhüttl was a picture of calm throughout but once a first win over Portsmouth since 2005 was secure he too was happy to soak up the adulation.“We will not forget this evening,” said the Austrian. “It was a fantastic atmosphere until the end and to score four goals is fantastic. It is more than only reaching the next round, it is about reaching the hearts of the fans. You could feel the tradition that is in this derby. I think I have never had such an atmosphere in a stadium so far and I have seen a lot in my career. A little bit raining, a fighting game and an unbelievable crowd if you think about English football, then that for me is English football.Portsmouth paraded a few familiar faces at the interval, including Benjani Mwaruwari, David Norris and Joel Ward, who scored the previous time these sides met in 2011. This time the image etched in the memory of Portsmouth supporters will be Ings knee-sliding towards a corner flag in front of the Fratton End.Ings is part of a new wave of players versed in the age-old antagonism, supposedly born of maritime tensions, including the Southampton midfielder James Ward-Prowse, a former Fratton Park season-ticket holder. On Portsmouth’s side there were Ben Close, raised a mile from here, and Brandon Haunstrup, from Waterlooville.But it was the fumes of a red flare that filled the air at full-time as ecstatic Saints supporters threatened to drown out Hasenhüttl’s pitchside media duties. For Kenny Jackett, whose side are without a win in League One since mid-August, it was tough to stomach. “I didn’t want to come away not having a go, just shutting up shop,” he said. “We tried to ruffle them and, if we had got the first goal, it could have been different.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ec54d790a34a09a726cfe04f9901ea22809eefc/0_104_3366_2020/master/3366.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f34264081e8489d92827ef6f4d0e4129","title":"preston manchester city carabao cup match report","story":"Manchester City could not repeat their eight-goal haul from the weekend against a side sitting third in the Championship but after making nine changes from the Watford glut Pep Guardiola was happy enough with three first-half goals against Preston.City handed a debut to 17-year-old Taylor Harwood-Bellis in his quest to explore all the centre-back options the club currently have, a back line that also included Angelino making his first full start and another teenager in Eric Garcia. Their manager was full of praise. “We can count on some extraordinary players,” Guardiola said. “We took the match seriously as always and, thanks to the young guys, we are through to the next round. The back four know each other from the academy and they combined perfectly.”If Harwood-Bellis looked mature beyond his years in defence, Raheem Sterling was the star of the attacking show, his goal in particular a classy run straight at the heart of the Preston defence with a couple of neat feints as he entered the area to buy himself more space.Josh Harrop could not quite reach an inviting Ryan Ledson cross with the first chance of the game in the opening minute and the same player struck an upright in the second half. But by that stage City had scored all their goals and were cruising. Sterling and David Silva helped set up Gabriel Jesus for the second, then Preston’s goalkeeper, Connor Ripley, was beaten by a deflection off his own defender as Ledson’s touch sent David Silva’s relatively innocuous cross into the net.Phil Foden hit the bar in the second half, again after an enterprising run from Sterling, and when the England player was withdrawn shortly before the end he was applauded from all sides of the ground. Sterling had brought a good save from Ripley in the first half, just before Jesus headed narrowly over from a David Silva cross to the far post.Preston had made several changes too and their manager, Alex Neil, thought his players performed well but perhaps paid the penalty for being a little too adventurous against top-class opponents. “We did all right, we didn’t disappoint, if anything we got a bit too hungry going forward and left gaps for City to exploit,” Neil said. “They scored some quality goals.”Guardiola defended Bernardo Silva when asked about his reaction to the news that the FA may discipline him over his allegedly racist tweet to his teammate Benjamin Mendy. “If they are going to do that, I think they need to know what sort of a person Bernardo is,” the City manager said.“I honestly don’t know what will happen but Bernardo is one of the loveliest people I have ever met in my life, he speaks four or five languages and Mendy is one of his best friends. They are like brothers and the response from Mendy was clear it was a joke all the time. I’ve seen many similar situations with white people and in any case the image is not about the colour of skin.“Bernardo is an exceptional person, completely open-minded about nationalities and skin colour. I think the authorities should put their focus on another issue because they don’t know which guy they are talking about.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a173bc0b32034ef3c4caf3f90ba9a33904b87dc0/0_147_3749_2250/master/3749.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6c0a3b2f081e9d57005fb8307ab80de","title":"sheffield wednesday everton carabao cup match report","story":"Marco Silva believed his side’s attacking approach early in the game paid idends after Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored twice in four minutes to guide the Premier League side into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup and ease the pressure on the Everton manager.After defeat by Sheffield United on Saturday left them 14th in the Premier League and Silva in the spotlight, it was the turn of the boyhood Blades fan Calvert-Lewin to take centre stage at Hillsborough.The 22-year-old struck after six minutes following a counter-attack which saw him cushion Djibril Sidibe’s ball and fire home off the underside of the crossbar.There was a gleeful celebration in front of the Kop before he slotted home Alex Iwobi’s low ball from close range to double the score and essentially seal the tie with 80 minutes remaining.Cameron Dawson denied Calvert-Lewin a hat-trick late in the first half but the damage had already been inflicted on Garry Monk’s team.Silva was pleased with his side’s response to Saturday’s defeat and said: “It was really important for us to start well the game with two early goals. We were the best team all the first half, we created more chances, Dominic had more chances, Richarlison as well.“We controlled the game and I don’t remember so many chances for them. We deserved the win and to play the next round was the most important thing for us.”So too did Silva praise Calvert-Lewin, saying: “Important for him to score twice. He had one or two chances to score to make the hat-trick but he did well to score in the important moment of the game and really important to win more confidence.”In the last three games he has scored three goals so let’s hope he continues in this way.”It may have been a different story had the Owls taken advantage of a golden opportunity after two minutes but Jordan Pickford thwarted Sam Winnall.Dominic Iorfa flashed a back-post header wide, Adam Reach could only guide the ball into Pickford’s hands in front of goal and Winnall nodded a fierce header past the post.Monk, who won the League Cup as a Swansea player in 2013, said: “Overall a lot of good things happened in that game for us. It wasn’t just about making changes. There were a few other situations I had to consider.“The truth is on the pitch. A few of them deserve their opportunity and to play and you need to see it. At the end of the day we are going to need the whole squad for the season.“I thought they did themselves proud tonight. Of course we are disappointed with the result: no-one wants to lose a game, no-one likes losing games. I think the difference really was they were more clinical with the chances they took and we weren’t.”League Two Crawley joined Colchester in the fourth round thanks to a 5-4 penalty shootout victory over troubled Stoke.Sam Vokes opened the scoring for Stoke in the 23rd minute but Nathan Ferguson equalised for the home side before half-time. Stoke played the last 28 minutes with 10 men after Nathan Collins’ dismissal. Vokes then missed the very first spot-kick, which proved decisive as Crawley scored all five of theirs.It was a happier night for Watford who battled to a 2-1 success against Swansea at Vicarage Road in the wake of their 8-0 defeat by Manchester City. Danny Welbeck opened the scoring for Watford in the 28th minute with his first goal for nearly a year but Sam Surridge equalised six minutes later and the hosts had to wait until the 79th minute for Roberto Pereyra to net the winner.There was a big away win for a Premier League side at Kenilworth Road, where Leicester defeated Luton 4-0. Demarai Gray scored twice with James Justin and Youri Tielemans also on target."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98fb84bd47b82738c431125fc0c7ac4a14dfd412/0_366_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e5ae282eb04e2e14d8d57a7296b7c4a","title":"global poverty conference to be held in slum","story":"Inaugural World Poverty Forum – dubbed ‘Davos with the poor’ – to take place in Kenya’s Kibera to ensure voices of poorest are heard A global conference on poverty is to take place in Africa’s largest slum in an effort to make sure the poorest get a voice.The inaugural World Poverty Forum will be announced on Wednesday in New York at the Decade of Action event taking place during UN general assembly week. It is already being dubbed as “Davos with the poor”.Social entrepreneur Kennedy Odede, who was raised in the slum of Kibera, in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, has founded the event to bring world leaders and policymakers together to “change the dynamic” of the way the big global issues are discussed. He said it was about making “worlds collide”.“It is high time that the policymakers come to us, the people and the communities who are doing great work on the ground,” he told the .“Meetings like Davos are all very well, to bring together world leaders, but there is no space for them to interact with the poor and with people doing the work in the communities. So this forum will fill this gap.”The forum is designed to tackle world poverty by reversing the often unequal power dynamics of development conferences, and will take place in January. It will be that rare example, said Odede, of a conference choosing its location to give a real voice to the poorest in finding solutions to their own problems.“We will have a 5050 split of influential leaders and of community leaders from Kibera, from Africa, from India, from Brazil, who have been left out of the conversations for too long.“This is not about people helicoptering in. They will come with humility, they will come in as our guest and we will showcase all the things people in Kibera can teach the world,” he said.“It is meant to be a learning journey – what is working, what is not working. We can learn from each other when the community get a voice.“People on the frontline must be included. They have to have a place at the table.“They have been left out of the decisions made about them. Why? Because it’s all been about top to bottom. Now it has to be about bottom to top, because inequality is growing too much. We need to fight this.“I’m so excited. This is for me a big step. We will be a bridge between real people and policymakers.”WPF will be one of the first events in next year’s plans to accelerate progress towards meeting the sustainable development goals, which are being widely criticised at the UNGA this week as being off course and unlikely to be met by the 2030 target.Odede, who is also the co-founder of Shofco, an organisation working in urban slums, said: “It is sometimes forgotten that any programme to improve lives can only be successful it if works with the grain of iniduals – and the bundles of talent, hope and fear that make up their unique experiences. We will bring leaders to a place where they can feel both the unforgiving reality of poverty alongside the hope that an institution like Shofco can create.“The World Poverty Forum will spark new ideas through worlds colliding, bringing together leading politicians, CEOs, NGOs, entrepreneurs and thinkers, with those who are making things happen on the frontline, in the thick of the community – rather than in a western five-star hotel.“We want to reverse the usual power dynamics of development conferences and release the energies that genuine collaboration can bring.”A two-day programme will focus on practical solutions to the issues of health, education, conflict and climate crisis that keep people entrenched in poverty. Delegates will visit projects in Kibera as well as attending “Hacking Poverty” seminars that look for simple solutions to everyday hardships. It will also celebrate pioneers in the global fight against poverty – from iniduals and tech startups to NGOs and corporations – with the launch of the first Kibera Awards.The event will hire local photographers, video crews, caterers and musicians and hold the daytime events in the Shofco school inside Kibera. The contribution of local people’s talents is intended as a reminder to delegates that there are rich pools of skill, flair and inventiveness in the world’s poorest communities.More than 1.3 billion people across the globe are described as “multidimensionally poor” – defined by ways in which people experience deprivation beyond their income, such as health, education and the standard of living.“There is an urgent need for a fresh approach to lifting up the world’s poorest as recent progress has been slow, patchy and unstable,” said Odede. 2020, he said, was “make or break year”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

So what does ‘boketto’ mean?Mark Radcliffe and Paul Langley are sipping tea in central Manchester. The former is the much-loved radio star the latter is something of a mystery. “Good, the less said the better,” Langley says from behind his spectacles and pot of Earl Grey. However, I do know he once made an EP in an outfit called Rack-It! “That was with Martyn Walsh from Inspiral Carpets,” he laughs. “He said, ‘You wanna do a track called Sex on Acid – that’ll annoy people.’ And it did.”Radcliffe and Langley are, they tell me, “soon to be legendary”. This will be in the guise of UNE, the name they have given themselves. The pair have made Lost, an album of lovely, plaintive electronica over which Radcliffe sings. They met five years ago in the Builder’s Arms in Knutsford, Cheshire. Radcliffe, new to the area, asked locals which pub was dog-friendly. This led to dog-walk encounters with Langley, and the pair were soon bantering over pints, about music and Manchester City.One day Langley mentioned the fact he made electronic music, and Radcliffe groaned. “I didn’t think it would be any good,” he says, “because he’s such a clown. But his hidden shallows turned out to be hidden depths. When I heard it, I thought, ‘This is surprisingly good.’”Radcliffe was reading Lost in Translation, Ella Frances Sanders’ illustrated compendium of untranslatable words from around the world. He wondered if it was possible to write a song called Boketto, which means “to gaze vacantly into the distance without thinking” in Japanese. “So I’d give Paul the idea and the picture from the book. He’d write music and I’d go away and write words.” The pair were surprised at how effectively this created what Radcliffe calls “electronic pop songs, but very warm and dreamlike”.Radcliffe hopes UNE aren’t seen as “some radio bloke having a dabble”. He was, after all, in bands before becoming a DJ. “I’ve never really seen a ide between the two. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn’t because radio people think, ‘We can’t play that – it’s Mark.’ I just hope we get the same chance as everyone else.”Over the years, his DJing has coexisted with playing in the not-yet-legendary pirate folkies Galleon Blast, spoof combo the Shirehorses, and Dr Feelgood-inspired Mark Radcliffe and the Big Figures. Early on, he even played drums in Skrewdriver, before singer Ian Donaldson became known as a white supremacist. “There were never any obvious signs of that while I was in them,” says the avowedly anti-racist DJ. “He did wear jackboots, though. God, I’m making this worse, aren’t I?”Meanwhile, UNE’s press release calls Langley a “Haçienda DJ-booth fixture”. Langley laughs. “My brother was actually the DJ. But I carried his record box around the world.”Radcliffe’s radio career began in 1979 when, at the age of 21, Manchester’s Piccadilly Radio asked him to present Transmissions, a show about the music exploding in the city, triggered by Joy Division and Factory Records. “I thought, ‘How hard can that be?’ I tried to be Manchester’s John Peel, telling people what we were playing in a manic depressive voice.”In 1997, he found himself (alongside ex-Fall guitarist Marc “Lard” Riley) briefly hosting Radio 1’s flagship breakfast show. “It was the biggest show in Europe – until we took it over,” he chuckles. Their anarchic, edgy, Mancunian humour didn’t always travel. “I’ve never forgotten the focus-group woman in Guildford who said, ‘I don’t pay my licence fee to hear scummy northerners.’”But his radio persona – self-effacing, ordinary bloke lost in music – works because it’s real. Langley roars at the tale Radcliffe tells of the time he and Lard were in David Bowie’s dressing room with the star asking where “Heroes” should go on the setlist. “I’m thinking, ‘Is this really happening?’” Radcliffe hoots. “Don’t ask us, Dave!” In August last year, Radcliffe was diagnosed with cancer. As Langley ferried his mate around during treatment, the pair became even closer. Radcliffe is now cancer-free and doesn’t want to spend his life worrying that it will come back. After well-received performances at Bluedot and Kendal Calling festivals, there will be more gigs, although the pair have yet to master the demands of being electronic gods.“One night,” says Radcliffe, “instead of singing, ‘The distant clatter of a thunderstorm’, I sang, ‘The distant clatter of a leprechaun.’ You can see the trouble we’ve got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9adf199ee34a97f4a616ae286addfb3d52c5417b/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e13cb6eefbc27ad6930201103a1296c","title":"how to your way into an ivy league school","story":"Journalist Evgenia Peretz discusses how US college tutor Rick Singer persuaded so many parents to take part in one of the biggest university scandals the Department of Justice has ever prosecuted.

This was later confirmed by a Labour spokesman. “This crisis can only be settled with a general election. That election needs to take place as soon as this government’s threat of a disastrous no deal is taken off the table,” Corbyn said.Corbyn set out his plan to win an election then negotiate a Brexit deal within three months, and hold a second referendum within six months without saying which way Labour would campaign.This appeared to squash the idea that Corbyn, as a temporary prime minister, could push for a second referendum and get Brexit sorted before a general election to focus on domestic issues – which is promoted by some MPs, including a few of his allies. A Labour spokesman later reiterated that the policy is election first, referendum second.Corbyn showed how he would fight an election as the anti-establishment candidate, rubbishing Johnson’s claims of being the voice of the people against parliament. “In a shameless bid to turn reality on its head, Boris Johnson’s born-to-rule Tories are now claiming to be the voice of the people,” he said. “A political party that exists to protect the establishment is pretending to be anti-establishment. Johnson and his wealthy friends are not only on the side of the establishment they are the establishment.”Corbyn announced a major new policy of a state-owned generic drug manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to the NHS. This would stop big pharmaceutical companies charging the NHS over the odds for medicines. “We will redesign the system to serve public health – not private wealth – using compulsory licensing to secure generic versions of patented medicines,” he said. “We’ll tell the drugs companies that if they want public research funding then they’ll have to make their drugs affordable for all. And we will create a new publicly owned generic drugs manufacturer to supply cheaper medicines to our NHS, saving our health service money and saving lives.”Corbyn ran through a series of big, bold policies announced by his shadow ministers at the conference including: “Crossrail for the north” nationalising the rail, postal and water industries plus the National Grid free prescriptions free personal care for the elderly and a net-zero emissions target for 2030. The policies go even further than Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto and may come with a large price tag. But Labour is calculating that people will be won over by ideas to make their lives easier if the tax burden falls on the very wealthiest and businesses. The party says its manifesto will be fully costed so the books are balanced."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30d453da908f7bc07e240695451f35bb7e60948e/1367_3633_2460_1476/master/2460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08aa5ddd7d1ddff598f80b0194bf28ee","title":"councils investing in quality homes","story":"Local authorities are increasingly building smart, environmentally friendly and beautifully designed homesTheir new houses may have won national media praise, been lauded by industry experts and even made the shortlist of the Royal Institute of British Architects’ (Riba) Stirling Prize. But for Norwich council, it’s the reaction from the residents on Goldsmith Street that has marked its 100 newly built homes as a success. “I was overwhelmed when I was told the property was mine. I simply couldn’t believe my luck,” says one resident. “Since moving and settling in, my life is barely recognisable. It feels like the fresh start and new beginning that I needed.”With intelligently designed streets, and patches of grass for children to play on, this energy-efficient development in Norwich – rented out by the council with secure tenancies at fixed rents – exemplifies the smart, environmentally friendly and beautifully designed homes now being built in greater numbers by local authorities.A combination of events, including the lifting of financial restrictions in 2018, has led to a resurgence of council house-building unheard of since the 1980s.Riba’s own research on the characteristics of places where people want to live includes case studies of mixed tenures, from Cambridge, York, Salford and Essex, among others. Good design is key – a plan for the right housing in the right place, with good access to local services a variety of housing types to create an integrated, erse community a design that creates a sense of ownership and belonging and qualities that make residents feel at home, such as effective noise insulation, good levels of natural light and room proportions, access to green space, and efficient use of fuel.In Hackney, the award-winning renovation of the King’s Crescent estate was led by the council’s in-house architect, Ken Rorrison. Three new towers were built and existing properties were upgraded: ground-floor garages and winter gardens were converted into new flats. Underpasses where residents felt unsafe were eliminated, and three new courtyards for communal use were built. Making all homes the same, whether they are social or private housing, has also been important, says Rorrison, even down to using the same materials. This has not always been a given until recently, social tenants could be forced to use separate entrances, and their children could be excluded from communal play areas, although the Greater London Authority has now banned this practice.“Everybody benefits from decent space standards, good ceiling heights, high levels of daylight, usable public spaces, and that balance of privacy and communality,” says Rorrison. “That’s universal and isn’t about whether someone’s a social tenant or private tenant.”Abigail Batchelor, an associate at architects Karakusevic Carson, says she starts every new project by taking a walking tour with locals. She finds people love older social homes. “They’re very bright, they’ve got good balconies, they’re really well lit and they have generous space.”The issues residents raise with her are more often about the journey from the street to their front door, with routes that don’t support safe walking and cycling, unwelcoming communal spaces, and landscaping that doesn’t prioritise health and wellbeing. By learning from the mistakes of the past, she adds, good design can help create good communities for years to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf7e1726bcfd08185d42621e70ef9fd2bee47a03/0_219_6579_3947/master/6579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4081064e41e80ba357f305dd2a12e37","title":"30 year child health study parenting alspac jean golding","story":"At a bright green table scattered with toys and juice cups sit Charlotte and her six-year-old daughter Amelia, while two-year-old Isabella races a yellow plastic shopping trolley across the floor. Being here is much more fun than school, announces Amelia, as she shows off the animal plaster that covers her (apparently painless) blood test to a smiling Professor Jean Golding.The emeritus professor of paediatrics and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol is founder of the hugely influential Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (Alspac), better known as Children of the 90s (CO90s). She has just turned 80 and has just published her latest paper on child health.Charlotte, who doesn’t want her surname used, belongs to the original cohort of children, her mother recruited in pregnancy, while Amelia and Isabella are the third generation – the so-called Children of the Children of the 90s (COCO90s). Their arrival has made this study unique for the length, breadth and depth of its data on medical, social, genetic, environmental, and inter-generational factors affecting our health and wellbeing. Now involving 27,600 people, a biobank of 1.2m samples (including DNA, urine and placenta), and countless questions and answers, it has led to more than 2,000 research papers and had a significant impact on policy.The UK and US governments’ 1990s Back to Sleep campaigns (advising that babies sleep more safely on their backs) were informed by Alspac work, as was the US government shift to advise women to eat fish in pregnancy. And data from CO90s babies revealed that using peanut oil on infants’ skin – then common in baby creams – increased the risk of allergic sensitisation.Golding’s idea for Alspac was considered “crazy … impossible”, she admits, when she first proposed following every pregnancy in the Bristol area with a due date between April 1991 and December 1992, and then studying the parents and children as they grew. The big funders, including the Medical Research Council (MRC), refused to commit to “this monster”, says Golding, waiting almost a decade before getting involved in what Bristol University had started. “And scientists said it would never work,” she adds. “They said we should concentrate on one topic.”The whole point was to collect as much information as possible – including data they didn’t yet have a use for – maximising the ability to make unexpected connections. She wanted it to be open access too, and Alspac now has more than 800 registered users in dozens of countries. In the last six years, 1,000 COCO90s have been added to the cohort, and a further 2,500 are expected in the next five years as the CO90s tip into their 30s.The reasons aren’t yet clear, but Alspac is working on it. In the meantime, the finding has led to calls for better mental health screening in pregnancy and greater availability of treatment. As a child, Golding spent months at a time in hospital and contracted polio at the age of 13, which left her permanently disabled. Being ill so much meant she “spent a lot of time watching,” she says. “So I really am an observer.”Clearly clever at school, she only realised many years later that her teachers were fighting over which of them would get the kudos of sending her to read their subject at a top university. Her interests were zoology, psychology and chemistry, but the maths teacher convinced her that she would be unable to do lab and field work - “I had a calliper and on uneven ground I would fall down” - so she went to Oxford to read maths.“I attended the first statistics lecture and thought ‘this is rubbish’. They kept saying ‘approximate’. I don’t like approximate. I like to know exactly.” She switched to another branch of maths. She uses stats now of course? “Yes,” she agrees, “but with care!”She stood down as scientific director of Alspac aged 65, but her research is going strong. This month she published a paper showing that the children of mothers who take paracetamol in pregnancy (around half of mothers-to-be in Europe and America) are more likely to have behavioural difficulties, including hyperactivity in their early years. Though these particular difficulties resolve by age eight, Golding says other associations may come to light and advises, “pregnant women should reduce their intake of drugs, including over-the-counter drugs, whenever possible”.Her research results often bring surprises, she says. In her current work on “fascinating” transgenerational effects, she recently found that if the grandmother smoked in pregnancy (yes, the grandmother), the grandchild was likely to have a higher than expected birthweight but a slightly raised risk of autism and obesity. Traumatic events cascade down the generations, sometimes in unexpected ways. “Shock in one generation can be linked to a higher rates of obesity later on,” she says. “And one study involving grandparents who had been in one of the great famines of the second world war found that their sons have better mental health than others.” Golding is now studying families with refugees, war deaths and similar challenges in their background and is “open to any results”.Her other main focus is locus of control. This identifies people as either “internals”, who feel they have some control over their fate, and “externals”, who think life happens to them and there isn’t much point in trying to change it. “The main psychologist in the field pushed for us to include questions on this from the start,” says Golding, “and it turns out to have a big effect on the way people live and parent.Clearly, Golding isn’t retiring any time soon. “I think I have enough to keep me going until I’m 100,” she says. Meanwhile, younger colleagues are developing new techniques for direct collection of data – including via smart devices and miniature head cameras – and examining social media, both for its use in data gathering and the effect it has on us.Alspac’s role, Timpson believes, is to “make observations, explain them to government, push for specific policies and see practical change”. It’s a powerful model that has already proved its worth.Charlotte is gathering her daughters ready to go home. She has always been proud to be one of the Children of the 90s, she says, and she hopes Amelia and Isabella will be too. With luck, she adds, she’ll see their children joining as the COCOCO90s, bringing still more insight and improvement to our health and wellbeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a2b277ebb837ff606d3803a7f6fed0b01d764ba/0_11_3474_2085/master/3474.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb33b5e2fbc9e884c1ab635295f0da58","title":"social housing is not welfare housing and people deserve better","story":"Ten people share their views on the state of social housing and what the future holdsAre housing associations straying too far from their historical mission of providing decent, affordable homes? What are the lessons for politicians and providers in the aftermath of the Grenfell fire? Amid an ever-deepening housing crisis, and two years after a tragedy that brought social housing under a sudden and unforgiving spotlight, there are plenty of big questions for the sector. But there are wider issues to consider too, according to those who know it best.One key message coming from those who live in, work in, study or want to change social housing is that it’s about much more than just buildings. From programmes to help tenants find work, to opportunities to get involved with the creative arts, providers can help residents fulfil their potential and live happier, more settled lives. Recent research by the University of Salford’s sustainable housing and urban studies unit found that housing associations could support a tenant into employment for as little as £25 to £30 a year, and that many tenants thought housing associations were better placed to do this than other organisations, because of the relationships they already had.There was much to celebrate, too, with praise for housing association staff making the effort to get to know residents and for work to ensure LGBT tenants don’t feel ignored or isolated. And there was news of activists joining forces with architects to reimagine affordable homes.We work with Barnet council and Barnet Homes to help young people living in social housing, through things like sports programmes and entrepreneurship training. We’ve even had sports day races between tenants and housing staff. Housing associations need to become more engaged with their residents, from the chief executives – who need to be going out on to the estates – all the way down. They need to do more than just collect rent and only talk to parents when their kids are in trouble. If residents are going to be active citizens, they need to feel they mean something to their housing provider.Clive Betts MPChair of the Commons housing select committeeAfter Grenfell, the most important lesson is that we can no longer treat social housing as poor housing for poor people. That’s where we’d got to: it was welfare housing, and people who ended up in it were seen as inadequate, and therefore not deserving of very much. And because people in social housing were poor and struggling, they found it hard to articulate their concerns, so they were completely ignored. Since then we’ve heard words from ministers, but what we haven’t seen is action, backed by money, to improve existing housing and make more available.Tom MurthaFormer housing association chief executive and founding member of Social Housing Under ThreatThere’s been a feeling that maybe housing associations have lost their way – that they’ve grown too big, or too commercial. Some are now changing. Some of the large ones have said very clearly that they need to go back to their social purpose. Some associations have recognised that, yes, they’ve been developing new homes that, if they can afford it, some people find wonderful to live in, but that they also need to invest in their existing stock. Some are a lot slower to recognise the need to change, and I think that tension and separation is going to grow.Social housing is not just bricks and mortar. As a membership body for providers who want to support their tenants into good quality work, we believe you’ve got to look at the impact of poverty on your community and do something about it. People living in social housing face a greater challenge to get into work, and when they do, they’re likely to earn less. But helping people into employment isn’t just a cutesy, nice-to-have extra, or part of a board’s mission statement research we commissioned shows there’s a bottom-line business case to support your tenants to support their own tenancies.Harris BeiderProfessor of communities and public policy, Birmingham City UniversityI think social housing has lost its way: it’s going towards a philosophy where the bottom line is everything. People are calling out for an alternative to the ideology driving Brexit and it’s beholden on social housing providers to articulate what it is that they’re about, and how they can reach out to people who are disadvantaged, or poor, or black, or refugees, and say “we are trying to be a driver for erse communities, because it’s part of our ethos and values”. I don’t see that in a uniform way within housing organisations. I want to see a more progressive voice.Anna LeckyEnvironmental activist working to build a tiny house community in BelfastOver the course of 11 months last year, 148 people who were homeless in Northern Ireland died while waiting for social housing. There’s a massive need for housing, but the shortage of single-person dwellings is a big problem. Tiny houses – sustainably built homes measuring approximately 35 sq metres, rented at low cost, like those designed here by the Holding Project – could be a solution. Other residents might be trying to get on the property ladder or have children who’ve left home. We want to prove there is a demand for change, for the chance to live small and live differently.I worked as a phlebotomist in the UK for many years, but became homeless in 2016. After a year in a hostel with no support, I moved to One Housing’s Arlington hostel in Camden and joined the art programme. It just opened the door for me: the first time they gave me a colour it was like they gave me magic. Art makes me calm, and it built up my confidence – I just forget every pain in my life. I live independently now but still use the studio and workshops at Arlington. It’s so important these kinds of things are provided.Anne PowerProfessor of social policy, London School of EconomicsWe’re losing a lot of social housing because of demolition and rebuilding. But there are a few cases where a housing association has taken control and replaced blocks one by one, allowing tenants to move across without breaking up communities. This requires careful, on-site housing management. Computer-based systems have their place, but they cannot run community services, or keep the grounds clean and safe. You need people on the ground and hands-on management. It means you can keep arrears in check, you can support people into work, you can help vulnerable people. Our research has shown that for every £1 invested in that kind of renewal, about £12 of social value is generated by reinforcing social links, maintaining neighbourhood conditions, and support community infrastructure.Luchia FitzgeraldLGBT rights activist and resident, Irwell Valley Homes, Greater ManchesterHousing associations need to be ready for an increase in the number of elderly LGBT tenants. Some are moving into accommodation and having to go back in the closet at the end of their lives because other residents don’t accept them. That’s absolutely heartbreaking. They also need to think about younger LGBT people – there’s a serious problem with them becoming homeless and invisible. At Irwell Valley we’re trying to create safe spaces for both groups, and we’re training people up to spot the depression and isolation they can suffer. But a lot of housing associations really need to step up and recognise these issues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a7ae152353308d4f42ecc50c9ef676c39097c7/0_150_4488_2693/master/4488.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9454c07cb03f03f285b5428f1c3f5177","title":"uruguay shock fiji to pull off historic victory in classic encounter","story":"There has never been a World Cup match like the one they played in Kamaishi this bright, blue, Wednesday afternoon, when it felt like every single one of the town’s 35,000 residents was out on the streets, handing out high fives and helloes, gifts of flags, fans, and handkerchiefs to the fans. The world’s media was here, too, all drawn to the story of the little town’s recovery from the devastating tsunami that hit it in 2011, and so was Crown Prince Akishino. They got a game worth watching, too, the first upset of the World Cup, as Uruguay beat Fiji 30-27, despite being nine-places below them in the world rankings.It was Uruguay’s first World Cup win in 16 years, and only their third ever. Given the others were against Georgia in 2003 and Spain in 1999, this must rate as the greatest game they’ve ever played.Fiji, on the other hand, are now all but out of the World Cup after two defeats in five days. Only two teams in the tournament’s history have ever made it through to the quarter-finals after losing two pool matches. They were abject, tired, sloppy, and complacent. They made almost as many handling errors as they managed to score points. Uruguay led 24-12 after a ring-a-ding first half. They scored three tries in that time, and were within an inch of securing a bonus point with a fourth, too. Fiji, who’d made 12 changes to team that lost to Australia on Saturday, scored two of their own, both from short range off the back of scrum penalties which they kicked into touch. In between, Uruguay scored their first after they swept up a loose ball, spilled by Leone Nakarawa as he tried a wildly ambitious offload. Scrum-half Santiago Arata wriggled, slipped, and squirmed through three tackles on his way to the try-line. Manuel Diana scored Uruguay’s second off the back of a line-out, after Juan Manuel Cat had charged down Alivereti Veiotakani’s clearance. Cat got the third himself, after a spectacular offload by Rodrigo Silva.The move started with another bit of poor play by the Fijians, after Semi Radradra left a high kick that was seized by Urguay’s full back, Gaston Mieres. Radrada almost gifted them a fourth with another loose pass, which Andres Vilaseca hacked downfield. The two of them raced each other to the ball as it bobbled over the line, but the replays showed Vilaseca had just knocked it on as he ed for it. Fiji made a worse mistake right after the half, when Tevita Ratuva blew a three-on one by passing the ball straight to Uruguyan instead of a teammate. Then Josh Matavesi missed a simple penalty attempt.The conversion he missed minutes later, after Api Ratuniyarawa bullied his way over for Fiji’s third, was even worse. Uruguay never did get that fourth try. It didn’t matter.The two penalties Felipe Berchesi kicked in the second half put them eight points ahead, even after Nikola Matawalu scored a fourth try for Fiji. Even though Matawala got a fifth in the very last minute, it still wasn’t enough to prevent defeat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70290ff865722fb68db1e8f46d1b5d86c300e37d/0_455_2494_1496/master/2494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=362f419c24fd8453b7869469335bd79e","title":"fiji v uruguay rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"Well, that’s it from me what a game and what a result. I’m off to lie face down somewhere to try and process it all. Thanks for your company. Here is the match report from Andy Bull.Here’s a tearful Juan Manuel Garamara, Uruguay captain, who was outstanding today“I’m really proud of my country, we are not the biggest but you can see what we can do. We have worked on this, we’ve always had to qualify, nothing granted to us, you saw the passion. Thanks to everyone who is here and believes in us. I don’t want this to end. Thanks to this city, it’s been a privilege to play here”I’m not embarrassed to say that I’m tearing up at that. Wonderful, wonderful stuff.Drink it in, everyone.Yep, what a performance.“Hi Lee,” says Shaun Lawson, “I live in Uruguay. Have done for getting on towards 8 years. I moved here because of a lifelong fascination with Uruguayan football I’ll be staying for life. They are absolutely incredible. The desire and tenacity of such a tiny country has to be seen to be believed... yet the people are so kind, so gentle! It’s a fantastic place. Rugby was a completely amateur sport here until very recently. Argentina have helped a lot, so has a totally new approach... but I cannot believe what they’re doing today. Win or lose they’re heroes - and essentially the first Uruguayan sporting team to do anything in something not called association football. VAMOS LOS TEROS! URUGUAY NOMA!” What a result for Uruguay. They race into each other’s arms, massive men dissolving into tears as they hold one another and allow the enormity of this result - and more importantly this incredible show of desire, pride and no small amount of ability - to sink into their exhausted but no doubt invigorated frames.Stunning, life-affirming stuff. I bloody love the Rugby World Cup.81 mins. Fiji take the scrum and Matawalu has a trademark pick and snipe to score. That’s the losing bonus point. They have the good grace not to celebrate much.Volavola is nearly over, but he’s lost it before the line. NO TRY! But the ref was playing advantage and we go back for that with the clock now in the red. All Fiji can play for here is a losing bonus point. Would you believe it?79 mins. Penalty to Fiji, but it all looks too late. They tap and go and all Uruguay need to do is soak up the clock through defending like the legends they have all game.78 mins. Fiji lineout in Uruguay half. They have two mins to score twice and if any team can do it they can, but on today’s showing they are more likely to knock on twice.They’ve won it cleanly and are attacking, but it’s all a bit limp.76 mins. Matawalu is through, but Echeverry does and amazing job of shepherding then and nailing him in the tackle. That was brilliant work by the Uruguay sub, had he rushed up Matawalu would have stepped him easily, as is his wont, but Echevery played it beautifully.And he’s slotted it! Uruguay are now two scores ahead and four minutes away from the best day of their rugby lives. I can’t spayke!74 mins.  Uruguay have a penalty! It’s in front and about forty metres out. Captain Gamanara, who has been unbelievable, tells Berchesi to slot it for the team72 mins.  Matavesi takes a towering and important catch to get Fiji back on the ball in their own half, but they again force it and Uruguay have it back, but they’ve kicked it away again.Uruguay need to keep possession in these situations. If they put it through phases something will come, either from their own efforts or Fiji’s indiscipline.69 mins.  Fiji go from their own 22, and the offloads are sticking now, but the Uruguay defence is up to it and Kessler drives Radrada into touch. Los Teros attack from the lineout where it’s spilled to Fiji but they can do nothing. Uruguary are back on the ball just inside the Fiji half.66 mins. Fiji are up to the Uruguay line via 17 phases of play and Matawalu picks up, dummies and falls over the line to score. Volavola has taken over kicking duties, but the result of missing remains the same63 mins. Fiji lose possession after an absolutely hideous squint throw on a short lineout, but Uruguay have let them have it back after Matawalu rips it. Fiji are back on the ball and into the opposition half. He’s only gone and kicked it! 19 minutes to history for these lads now.59 mins.  Uruguay are in the Fiji 22 again, it’s a solid phased set and they inch closer with every carry. After 15 phases Fiji are off their feet and it’s a penalty our right on the 15 metre line. Berchesi fancies it.I keep saying this, but Uruguay continue to be marvellous.56 mins.  Uruguay look absolutely knackered now and are emptying the bench. Fiji have brought on the electric Matawalu at scrum half, which will be a nightmare for a tiring defence.54 mins. This game is very close to disintegrating into a wonderful, ramshackle, let’s all chuck it about, glorious mess. In the midst of it all, Fiji infringe and Berchesi is lining it up from the right touchline, but it’s a long way short. It was a bit of a hail mary effort.52 mins. Oh that’s frustrating. Uruguay win the scrum comfortably and have a cracking position to attack from in middle of field, they work it right and force it a bit too much, ending up passing forward.Volavola is on for Veitokani, this will see Matavesi go to fullback. Volavola on could be bad news for Uruguay as he’ll get the backline going.49 mins. Arbelo is off in Uruguay front row and Rombys, the big farmer, is on. Hopefully this will sort the creaking scrum as they have one in a great position just outside Fiji 22.47 mins. Fiji are up into the 22, it’s worked right to Ratuva who batters over. Uruguay looking like they are tiring here, perhaps inevitably.Matavesi mangles another kick and misses the conversion.That was utter dreck from Matavesi, the ball screwing horribly left like his kicking boot is shaped like a toblerone.44 mins.  Fiji are in possession again inside the Uruguay half. they are injecting some more urgency into their running and Uruguay infringe with a high tackle in the eagerness. It’s pretty much in front and Matavesi goes full non-Fiji and looks to kick sticks42 mins. Fiji have knocked on already, but possession is kicked back and forth before Fiji are through the line. They have a three on one with the line waiting and casually look to play the last pass to Nakarawa, but it’s intercepted by Rodrigo Silva! That was nothing short of a total, lackadaisical disgrace from the Fijiians. Then they knock on, of course.Forty minutes from a ridiculous, defining win from Uruguay, forty minutes from a “why did you bother coming?” loss for Fiji.Let’s not forget, the last time these teams faced each other Fiji won 68-7. Given what Fiji are capable of in attack then a solid win is still on the cards, but as poor as Fiji have been, Uruguay are worth every yen of their lead, their tenacity and desire has been world class.“How much is the short turnaround time between games for some teams impacting this World Cup in your view?” asks Andew Lewis, “I thought Russia would get marmalised by Samoa on a short week, but if anything the momentum seemed to help whereas today are Fiji feeing the effects of their weekend game?”There’s been a number of changes to the Fiji team which hasn’t helped either, but I don’t believe this first forty from them is down to a short turnaround. They look like they can’t be bothered in defence and their body language isn’t great, which is more down to attitude that physical capability.That attitude factor is crucial to why Russia looked better than expected yesterday, also, if you ask me. Which you did.It’s been very fitful with not a great amount of obvious quality, but Uruguay have essentially been 15 massive hearts on legs and put themselves in a great position.Fiji will be getting the mother of all rollickings in the changing room, and quite right too.Fiji knock on AGAIN, marmalise the Uruguay scrum AGAIN, but Arata digs it out and into touch. The end of a brilliantly barmy half of rugby.38 mins. And the fly half extends their lead! 36 mins.  A very nasty accidental clash of heads here Rutiniyawara and Cat seed the Uruguay centre on the deck with blood spilling under his eye and he’s off for an HIA. Ref Gauzere has given the penalty for high tackle, which seems harsh, it looked a total accident.35 mins. Uruguay pilfer Fiji’s lineout and are into the Fiji 22 again. This could be a bonus point try for Uruguay before half time if it comes to something. No, I don’t believe I just wrote that either. The ball is hacked through by Vilaseca and it’s a chase between him and Goneva over the line for a grounding scramble. The ref reckons no try, but sends it upstairs to be sure. It looks a knock-on and the TMO agrees. Fiji scrum on their own 5 metre line.Fiji look about as interested in defence as a teenager on a school trip to the Lancashire Transport Museum.31 mins.  Similar pattern of Fiji moving the ball and making some ground against the fanned out Uruguay defence. It’s then knocked on in midfield as Fiji’s general sloppiness today comes to the surface again. Can’t help thinking theur mindset is lacking coming into this they thought it would be easier that this - hell, we all did - and now are struggling to adjust.29 mins. Berchesi spills a simple catch off a kick in his own 22 and this will given the dominant Fiji scrum a chance to go from just outside the Uruguay 22.26 mins. This is a bloody lovely try. Uruguay work it right to left, riding tackles and confidently handling out of the tackle or drawing the man and giving. Centre Cat receives it out left from a lovely inside offload from Rodrigo Silva and they’re in again.Berchesi kicks a brilliant conversion from out wide. This is brilliant!24 mins. Fiji are putting it through hands, but Uruguay are sensibly keeping people out of the breakdown and leaving full tackle line coverage across the field and rushing up in defence. This is frustrating Fiji a bit and eventually the ball is out for at Uruguay line out. This is really good stuff from the Uruguay.22 mins.  Lineout goes to tail and it’s gathered and rumbled, a phase later and lock Manuel Diana is forcing himself over from 3 metres. Fiji looked extremely disinterested in defending with any aggression there.Matavesi with the conversion20 mins.  Uruguay have not let this dampen their defensive ardour and they charge down a Fiji clearance kick, it’s off a player in white for a lineout which Los Teros take well and they win a penalty in the tackle. Berchesi sends it to the corner again.18 mins.  Fiji win the lineout and it’s Delokoto again on the inside pop, but this time he’s hauled down, but Fiji still have it, moving it left and right. There’s very nearly a turnover after Freitas clamps on, but Fiji get it out and the prop is over from inches a couple of phases later.Matavesi makes no mistake with the kick16 mins. uruguay are absolutely flying into the tackles here, and Fiji look a little shaken by their intensity. However, their discipline keeps slipping and Fiji are up to the Uruguay 22 after a scrum penalty.12 mins.  Uruguay are running it from their own 22 before Arata decidese this is silly and puts the box kick in. It looks a little too deep but nakarawa flings an offload to no-one but the ground which Arata pounces on to run in and finish in stepping style from 30 metres out.Berchesi slots the conversion. 10 mins.  Fiji are working the ball around but going nowhere in their own half before Uruguay let them off the hook by giving away a soft penalty for offside at breakdown. So frustrating for their coach as their aggression in defence had done the hard work there and then threw it away.7 mins. Fiji fullback Veitokani executes a beautiful chip and gather and he’s into open pasture and flings it wide left to Nakosi who is tackled but Uruguay are lying all over it. the penalty is put in touch and from the lineout hooker Delokoto gets it back off a short throw and is in. Matavesi misses the extras from the left touchline.4 mins. Fiji have some phases around halfway but the Uruguay defence is up to it, eventually Fiji run out of patience and chip over the top which Los Teros scrum half Arata mops up. Possession is traded a bit and the game remains bunched around halfway with little solid progress from either team2 mins. Uruguay, who are not short of ability with ball in hand, try a nice backs move from the lineout and it looks good right up to the point that winger Freitas spills his pass on the arc. Scrum Fiji just in their own halfFiji receive the ball and it’s a very neat and tidy despatch to touch. We’re underwayFiji sing along with contained passion before the Uruguay lads give it the full beans. If the result was based on that performance then Los Teros have just thumped Fiji. Unfortunately for them, it isn’t.Fji give us a spirited Cibi dance and we’re nearly ready to go.Here come the teamsThe now familiar takai drum welcome greets the players before they line up. There’s genuinely emotional and moving scenes in the quiet dignity of the crowd during the moment’s silence to remember those lose lost in the tsunami of 2011. There’s been much chat in the opening matches over the consistency or refereeing, our man Rob Kitson has a viewI know there’s millions of you out there following this, so get in touch via Email or tweet @bloodandmud with any thoughts, opinions, recipes, whatever.Former Argentina scrum-half and now World Rugby senior suit Agustin Pichot is on the telly, talking about how the town of Kamaishi has been given hope and focus as a RWC venue after being devastated by the 2011 tsunami. Lovely, if bittersweet, story.And unlike on his Twitter account he’s not taking the opportunity to have a right slag off of his own organisation’s rankings system, which makes a nice change.Only three of the Fiji side that lost to Australia at the weekend remain in the starting fifteen today - Dominiko Waqaniburotu, Leone Nakarawa, and Semi Radradra. Among the many changes, veteran and recent Harlequins signing Niki Goneva comes in, while Newcastle’s Josh Matavesi slots his considerable frame in at 10.The experienced Felipe Berchesi - who plays his rugby at Dax in France - starts at fly-half for Uruguay, while the all heart and small frame captain Gaminera is at seven. He really is a joy to watch, that fella.Hello to all of you joining us for our coverage of Fiji vs Uruguay.Let’s be honest, a large number of us when asked what we know of rugby in Uruguay will probably answer that some of the players are not averse to eating one another when things get desperate. Outside of this macabre yet uplifting bit of their rugby history, we are all generally a little stumped when it comes to their on-field exploits, given we only see them sporadically in Rugby World Cups. This is the fourth tournament appearance for Los Teros, after previous showings in 1999, 2003 and 2015, winning two games in that entire history - one vs Spain in ‘99 and the other over Georgia four years later. Other that that the big tournament has been a tough old ride for the South Americans and four years ago they lost all four matches convincingly, including being on the wrong end of a 47-15 defeat against today’s opponents Fiji.Despite the much heralded recent professionalisation processes put in place by their Union and World Rugby, which has Uruguay on their way to a sustainable Tier 2 future, it’s hard to see any other outcome that defeat for them in this their first game of 2019.While Uruguay have been waiting this long to make a tackle or run in anger, this is Fiji’s second outing after their loss to Australia on Saturday. The islanders started that game in rampaging style before their opponents pulled themselves together to do the necessary - today will likely be all the former without the latter. This appears all the more inevitable when you consider the latest meeting between these two sides in Autumn 2018 saw Fiji run in ten tries to win 68-7.This is set to be a long and humbling couple of hours for Uruguay whostill have a number of part time players and have the youngest squad at the tournament, average age just over 26 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36c547748da29e60312c62bcaab80894537d68e/136_214_3309_1987/master/3309.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e49bfe7c1e2236237849e4de6eb9ecf9","title":"uber london licence transport for london","story":"Transport for London again rejects ride-hailing firm’s application for a full licenceUber’s application to renew its private hire operating licence in London has been rebuffed again by regulators.Transport for London has instead given the ride-hailing firm only a two-month extension to its licence, which is due to expire on Wednesday night.It is the second time in two years that TfL has rejected Uber’s application for a full operating licence.In September 2017, at the end if its first five-year licensing period, TfL said Uber was not a “fit and proper” firm, citing concerns including passenger safety. On appeal, Uber was granted a 15-month provisional licence.TfL said its initial decision not to licence Uber had led the firm to improve its culture and governance.A TfL spokesperson said: “Uber London Ltd has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”The two-month licence will have additional conditions attached to ensure passenger safety, covering ride-sharing, insurance and checks on driver’s documentation by Uber.The terms of the 15-month licence granted by magistrates last year will continue to apply, obliging Uber to produce an independently verified assurance report every six months, elect three non-executive directors to its board, give TfL four weeks’ notice of any changes to its operate model, and to report any potentially criminal complaints from passengers to the politan police.In July this year Uber was fined £28,800 for two counts of its drivers operating without insurance and for failing to keep proper records.Uber said it had made progress, including more checks on driver hours and additional safety measures for passengers. Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said: “TfL’s recognition of our improved culture and governance reflects the progress we have made in London. We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our clean air plan is helping to tackle air pollution.“We will keep listening, learning and improving to provide the best service while being a trusted partner to London.”Black cab drivers said the ruling showed Uber should not be trusted by Londoners. Steve McNamara, the general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association, said: “Granting Uber a two-month temporary licence clearly shows that the firm have failed their probation and are still a huge threat to public safety.“Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator’s licence ever shows the mayor doesn’t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.“It’s time the mayor pulled the plug on Uber’s immoral operation for good.”The GMB union, which represents minicab drivers, said Uber had had “more chances than a game of Monopoly”. Steve Garelick, regional officer, criticised the decision: “A two-month licence extension is no good for anyone – it leaves uncertainty for drivers and passengers, meanwhile Uber still operates an unsafe model on the streets of London.”A spokesman for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said he backed TfL’s decision. He said: “Sadiq has been crystal clear that in London it doesn’t matter how powerful and how big you are, you must play by the rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac40c94abcd685a259b01db9a033e1df8be845c/0_26_3831_2299/master/3831.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eddd459b19e0882995af45e57077e4e0","title":"victory for google in landmark right to be forgotten case","story":"Europe’s top court says firm does not have to take sensitive information off global searchThe “right to be forgotten” online does not extend beyond the borders of the European Union, the bloc’s highest court has ruled in a major victory for Google.The right, enshrined in a 2014 legal ruling, required search engines to delete embarrassing or out-of-date information, when requested by the iniduals concerned but in a landmark ruling on Tuesday, the European court of justice said search engine operators faced no obligation to remove information outside the 28-country zone. It however said search engines must “seriously discourage” internet users from going onto non-EU versions of their pages to find that information.“The balance between right to privacy and protection of personal data, on the on hand, and the freedom of information of internet users, on the other, is likely to vary significantly around the world,” the court said in a statement on the decision. The right to be forgotten was not an absolute right, the court said, and had to be balanced against other fundamental rights, in accordance with proportionality.Privacy campaigners hailed “ a victory for global freedom of expression”, while Google welcomed the court’s decision.The case originated in a dispute between Google and the French privacy regulator CNIL, which in 2015 called for the firm to globally remove links to pages containing damaging or false information about a person.Google introduced a geo-blocking feature in 2016 following year, which stopped European users from being able to see delisted links. However, it resisted censoring search results for people in other parts of the world, challenging a €100,000 (£88,376) fine CNIL tried to impose.The technology firm argued that, if this rule were applied outside Europe, the obligation could be abused by authoritarian governments trying to cover up human rights abuses.The 2014 ruling related to a test case brought by a Spanish man after he failed to secure the deletion of an auction notice of his repossessed home dating from 1998 on a Catalan website.Google won the backing of the ECJ court adviser Maciej Szpunar earlier this year, who said the right to be forgotten should be enforced only in Europe and not globally. Judges follow such non-binding opinions in four out of five cases.The US firm was also supported by Microsoft, Wikipedia’s owner the Wikimedia Foundation, and the non-profit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, among others.Google had previously warned of the dangers of overreach by Europe. In a blogpost two years ago, the company said there should be a balance between sensitive personal data and the public interest and that no one country should be able to impose its rules on citizens of another.Responding to the judgement on Tuesday, Peter Fleischer, Google’s senior privacy counsel, said: “Since 2014, we’ve worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people’s rights of access to information and privacy. It’s good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.”Google and rival search engines will have to take measures, the ECJ said, to “effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously discourage” users in the EU from using other versions of its site to access removed content.Thomas Hughes, executive director of the freedom of expression organisation Article 19, described the ruling as a victory for global freedom of expression. “Courts or data regulators in the UK, France or Germany should not be able to determine the search results that internet users in America, India or Argentina get to see … It is not right that one country’s data protection authorities can impose their interpretation on Internet users around the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab42c751fed857c20b25ffd14ee4b0f8d8045f8/96_156_4396_2638/master/4396.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e07550cfc6b34ac9b8fb0ce8cf613f8a","title":"woods forests activities autumn colours wildlife walks","story":"Foraging, wildlife, art, cycling and walks feature in this pick of autumnal activities, set to a glorious backdrop this year as leaf colours promise to be particularly richWestonbirt Arboretum near Tetbury is one of the best places in the UK to view a huge variety of autumn colours.

Sculpture fans can also visit Rachel Whiteread’s Nissen Hut in Dalby Forest, North Yorkshire, which was installed last year to mark the centenary of the first world war (free, daily, 1418now.org.uk).Autumn is a great time to go foraging in the forest for mushrooms, nuts and berries. Unless you are an experienced forager, though, it is best to go with an expert to ensure anything harvested is safe and sustainable. One such company is Northern Wilds, which runs foraging days in Kielder Forest. The hunt ends with a feast prepared in the “wild food wagon” – a former military truck now powered by biodiesel and equipped with a wood-fired Rayburn. The day is based at Kielder campsite, handy for spending a night stargazing in the forest (Kielder is a dark sky park). • Adult £65, child £45, 5 October, northernwildsKnapdale Forest in Argyll \u0026amp Bute is known as Scotland’s rainforest – the oak woodland is bisected by lochs and backs on to the sea.

The streaming service already screens Fleabag in more than 200 countries and territories including the US.“I’m insanely excited to be continuing my relationship with Amazon. Working with the team on Fleabag was the creative partnership dreams are made of. It really feels like home. I can’t wait to get going,” Waller-Bridge said as the announcement was made on Tuesday.While she emphasised the creative benefits, the news echoed growing warnings from senior UK television industry figures that homegrown British on-screen talent is increasingly being bought up by international rivals which “increasingly want to decide what we read, watch and listen to”.Alex Mahon, the chief executive of Channel 4, told the Royal Television Society conference on Thursday there was a “growing concentration of power in the hands just a few tech behemoths”.She added that such firms were motivated by their own commercial interests, which might lead them to promote their own content first, “whether it’s Amazon boosting its own products on marketplace, Google prioritising its own podcasts or Netflix serving us its own productions”.That was followed by a warning from the former BBC director general, Mark Thompson, who will say the UK is facing “a total loss of culture sovereignty”.Thompson will tell an audience at the Steve Hewlett memorial lecture in London on Tuesday night: “No one wants to see the UK turn into a cultural ‘Airstrip One’, but it’s a clear and present danger. With newspapers struggling and broadcasters outgunned, I fear only effective and salient government media policy stands between Britain and a total loss of cultural sovereignty.”Fleabag and those associated with it won six awards at the Emmys, including honours for writing, directing and acting, as well as casting and editing. The programme was also named the overall outstanding comedy series.The programme features Waller-Bridge as a young woman living in London who provides the audience with outrageous and intimate details of her life. It premiered in 2016 to critical acclaim, but was initially overlooked at the Emmys, not scoring a single nomination.Waller-Bridge has also received acclaim as the writer and showrunner of the first season of the BBC America television series Killing Eve, starring Jodie Comer, who won an Emmy this week, and Sandra Oh."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6df0fa10b7e1008fa876dee8f4d057a9aab12d7/295_0_4369_2623/master/4369.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b59f367a9142e80009879242e6965c2","title":"love in the countryside review a dating show as hot as a stoked up aga","story":"It’s the anti-Love Island, with welly boots and 6am milking sessions ... but you are rooting for Sara Cox to find these flirty farmers the love they deserveKaty is looking for “the power, the stamina, the looks.” In sheepdogs, that is. “That’s what you need in a man,” observes Sara Cox and Katy gives one of those full-throated sexy laughs. She has been married four times – she looks like a middle-aged rock chick and it really wouldn’t surprise me if one of those times had been to Mick Jagger – but single for more than 10 years. It’s not easy to meet men near her remote Cumbrian farmhouse, where she trains sheepdogs (“It’s dog-shit city here”), so she’s hoping to meet someone on Love in the Countryside (BBC Two). It’s a dating show, presented cheerfully by Cox, who grew up on a beef farm, and it is delightful.This is the second episode of the second series. Last week, we met Martin, 44, a bristly, sweet-faced Yorkshire farmer who hasn’t had a relationship for more than a decade: he spent those crucial mate-finding years on the business after his father died, shepherding it through the financial stresses that saw so many farms go under. And we met Grace, 23 and already wedded to her family farm on the Welsh border, preparing to take it over in a few years. Both chose a shortlist of potential partners from those who had written in to the programme, then, after a bit of speed dating, invited three each back to their farms.This week, we are seeing how they are getting on. At Grace’s farm, Martin, a trainee psychologist, is getting a lift in the tractor, and he is as excited about it as a little boy on a shopping centre ride. It is endearing but a bit tiresome. “Ugh, bloody hell,” says Grace when he gets out. At the field, the men are trying to put up fences. Beefy Greg, who works for Royal Mail, is struggling hot Mike isn’t but that’s because he has done it before (he keeps alpacas for fun). They are like two rutting stags.In Yorkshire, Martin invites Laura-Lea out for dinner at his local pub. “I’ve got to make sure in my mind that she’s not after that chocolate box farm,” he says, “because this isn’t that farm.” We know, Martin, we saw your derelict house last week. But they are so giggly and twinkly with each other, I am already picturing Laura-Lea in full-time wellies.It is the anti-Love Island. Nobody is here, stuffed with filler and honed of body, to play games or become Instagram-famous. These are people, of all ages, who have lived they have tales of loneliness, orce, single parenthood and responsibilities. There is an insight into the realities of rural life – the isolation and hard graft, as well as the beauty of the landscape and the wonders of calves and lambs and collies.In Cumbria, Katy’s 16-year-old daughter is worried about her mum being alone in her remote house, and would like her to meet someone. “If it happened, it would be very nice,” says Katy, sharpening a kitchen knife. “It’s not likely to. Who’s going to fancy me?” Who wouldn’t? She’s funny and spirited, and looks, fabulously, somewhere between Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and Keith Richards.“Oh, sorry, I think I’ve stumbled into a male-model competition,” says Cox, gently ribbing the four sixty- and seventysomething men Katy has chosen, who are waiting at a Kensington hotel. “They’ll be totally out of their comfort zone so it will be interesting to see how they fit in,” Katy says of the three she chooses.On the other farms, it’s 6am and milking time. On Grace’s farm, only Greg has managed to get up. In Yorkshire, Martin has asked Laura-Lea to help, and she throws herself into it. “She has become a lot more attractive,” he says. His other date, Hermione, admits to feeling jealous. “I think he’s leaning more towards Laura-Lea,” she says. It seems obvious to us all.But then Hermione and Martin spend the afternoon together while Laura-Lea is stuck cooking a roast, and they get on really well. There’s a tricky moment over the roast potatoes. The timing of the meal could have been better, says Laura-Lea testily, “because you two wouldn’t have been out in a field for ages.” It still comes as a shock when Martin chooses Hermione. They make a slightly awkward, but sweet, couple. “It does seem a long time since I’ve been so excited,” he says, waving her off. “I think I’m actually missing her already.”On the Welsh border, Grace has a tearful realisation about her future, and how her townie dates don’t fit into it. Greg had asked her about “annual leave”, as if she has an HR department, instead of her dad and a few hundred animals. “Having the boys here has made me realise it’s ridiculous for me to expect someone to fit into this lifestyle,” she says. Still, Mike has the alpacas so he may be a better bet. He had to go away for a day, but now he’s back, bringing with him his dog and his extreme handsomeness. There’s a lot of flirting going on. It’s all as hot as a stoked-up Aga, but solid and cosy, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e135ee2f3678b50060b607f24e36e9baa4227a48/457_196_1106_664/master/1106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3041b5ee6c98096583f24248d5bfa2a5","title":"simple tips for blitzing your work to do list","story":"You don’t need to master mindfulness or download a complicated productivity app to stay on top of your adminEver get to that stage where you seem to be spending all your time and energy just putting things off? You know you should get stuff done but you find yourself weighed down by the tyranny of your to-do list.And, of course, the more you put something off, the larger the looming shadow it casts. This is particularly insidious when it comes to dull-but-essential tasks, such as admin.And if you’re running a small business, it can be even harder to discipline yourself, especially if you’re working on your own or from home. Moreover, the burden of business admin can feel particularly oppressive, sapping your ability to focus on growing your company.The internet is full of life hacks and tips to help you break this cycle of inertia. But all-too-often the suggestions feel like just another thing to add to your to-do list. Likewise, techniques for improving your time management can sometimes seem a bit, well, time-consuming.Happily, however, there are a number of quick-and-easy tips that you can implement immediately – whether it’s advice for beating procrastination, resisting unhelpful impulses or countering your phobia of finances.For instance, when it comes to tackling the urge to check your social media, try thinking about how bad you’d feel in the near future having failed to complete the task at hand.Or if you’re trying to avoid procrastinating, tell someone else your intended goals for that particular day. This will make you feel more accountable – after all, it’s harder to break an intention that you’ve declared to others than it is to break a promise that you’ve made to yourself.There are also practical techniques for tackling some of the peskier admin tasks that tend to linger on people’s to-do lists – such as nailing your tax return, managing your web presence, and getting the correct kind of business insurance.1. Beat procrastinationProcrastinating doesn’t mean you’re workshy. It’s more likely to mean you’re just trying to stop yourself from feeling bad – either because you have to do something you’d rather not, or you’re worried you won’t be able to complete the task. So, try to focus on the positive outcome instead.2. Control your impulsesIn a world increasingly governed by instant gratification and the addictiveness of our smartphones, the ability to control our impulses is essential to getting things done. But try to think of this as a two-stage process: first, resist the temptation by making it harder to act on that initial urge – for instance by locking your phone in a drawer so you can’t check social media. And, second, maintain that resistance by consciously forming new positive habits.3. Overcome your financial phobiaAdmin avoidance can stem from a general anxiety about financial literacy. According to Brad Klontz, a financial psychologist and author, one way to combat this is to find yourself a financial mentor: “A great way to challenge your beliefs is to find someone who’s a step or two ahead, pick their brains, and become a student of their money mindset.”4. Tackle time managementOne simple trick is to try to become more aware of the value of each moment. “Remember every task comes with a cost,” says podcaster and author Ellen Hendriksen. “Be mindful about what task you are choosing to spend your time on, because that is time not doing other tasks.”5. Find your flowBeing “in the zone” or achieving a “flow state” can give us the focus and energy to perform at our best. One trick is to insulate yourself from tasks that might otherwise distract you by scheduling time in the week to do all the bits of admin that would otherwise intrude.6. Tooling yourself upThe popular idiom holds that a bad worker always blames their tools, but perhaps the opposite is also true: a good worker will always give them credit. Having the right kit helps you signal to yourself your intention to do a job well. In short, if we have good tools, we’re more likely to look forward to using them.7. Nail your tax returnAdopt so-called “microproductivity” methods by breaking this annual round of torture into a series of smaller tasks. These can then fit into those little moments of spare time we occasionally find ourselves with. For instance, try to view each figure that you need to obtain as a distinct task to be completed on its own.8. Manage your web presenceOne byproduct of ramping up your web presence is you can be inundated with demand that you can’t meet. “You turn your advertising off then,” says Jimmy McCann, head of digital strategy at Search Laboratory, which helps clients with online advertising. “It would also be worth having an overflow network to pass stuff on to and get a kickback.”9. Prepare a loan pitchSometimes a business needs a cash injection – whether it’s for upgrading equipment or premises, or just a bridging loan to help with a short-term cashflow problem. However, asking for money and demonstrating an ability to repay it can be stressful and time-consuming. Try to minimise the anxiety and avoid the possible pitfalls by being realistic about your projections – that way you can give a solid timeframe for repayments.10. Get insuredIt can be tempting to put off taking out business insurance. It can linger at the bottom of your to-do list because of the complacent attitude that “it won’t happen to us”. Part of the problem is that many people don’t appreciate the sheer number of possible hazards that exist in the workplace and their potential fallout – whether from accidental damage, disruption or injury. Often, it’s the anticipated complexity of sorting out cover, rather than the cost, that puts people off. But getting the right cover can be simpler than you’d think.For expanded advice on how to overcome common obstacles to getting things done, go to thewhats-stopping-you"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029220.1569367507!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"air quality parts of dublin city on course to breach eu guidelines","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Traffic on College Street joined by Pearse Street traffic. Photograph: Cyril ByrneParts of Dublin city centre are likely to breach EU and World Health Organisation guidelines for air quality in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.It also found the worst air pollution in 2018 was recorded at an EPA monitoring station near Heuston Station, at St John’s Road West, “due largely to our reliance on fossil-fuelled motor vehicles for transport” .Launching the Air Quality in Ireland Report 2018 to coincided with International Lung Day on Wednesday, the EPA said an estimated 1,800 people died prematurely every year in the Republic as a result of poor air quality.The report found that although the State’s overall air quality for 2018 met the legal requirements of EU standards, it fell short of the tighter World Health Organisation guidelines.And in a commentary on the 2018 report and prediction for the overall 2019 results, the EPA said “in urban areas, transport-related emissions of nitrogen dioxide are increasing, and it looks probable that Ireland will exceed the EU annual legal limit value for nitrogen dioxide in the near future”.Frequent breachesThe Air Quality in Ireland Report 2018 is the latest in a series of EPA reports to raise concern about air quality, particularly in Dublin.In July the organisation said many areas of Dublin were affected by nitrogen dioxide, with indications that frequent breaches of EU limits were occurring due to large volumes of traffic.High levels of nitrogen dioxides are notable for their contribution to respiratory illness and asthma, with children and older people most vulnerable. The July report attributed the risk to “reliance on fossil-fuelled motor vehicles for transport”.The EPA said the worst areas in the capital were along the quays at the entrance to and exit from the Dublin Tunnel, along the M50, on Pearse Street and in the vicinity of Heuston station.EPA ambient air quality manager Patrick Kenny said the worst excesses, recorded near Heuston Station, were “due largely to our reliance on fossil-fuelled motor vehicles for transport”.In relation to pollution from domestic fires he said levels of particulate matter – fine particles – in air was a “growing concern”.“Levels of this pollutant are particularly high during the winter months, when people’s use of solid fuels such as coal, peat and wood impacts negatively on air quality, especially in small towns and villages,” the EPA report said.Two townsIt compared two towns – Bray in Co Wicklow and Longford in Co Longford – finding that Longford had more polluted air, at least in part because of the lack of a ban on smoky fuels.Mr Kenny noted that any changes to more air-friendly home heating and solid fuel products would have a subsequent improvement on air quality.In urban areas, it said, transport-related emissions of nitrogen dioxide are increasing, and “it looks probable that Ireland will exceed the EU annual legal limit value for nitrogen dioxide in the near future.”Mr Kenny said implementing the transport options outlined in the Government’s Climate Action Strategy would also help reduce air pollution caused by vehicles."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029731.1569389581!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"higgins urges us to reverse decision on paris climate accord","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins delivers his address at  New York University on Tuesday. Photograph: Maxwell’s President Michael D Higgins has urged the United States to revisit its decision to leave the Paris climate change agreement, as he argued that climate change is the most pressing issue facing the global community.In a speech delivered at New York University on Tuesday evening, Mr Higgins highlighted the threat posed by climate change.“Failure to take radical, urgent action in relation to climate change that will effectively subject future generations to an existence of threat in an ever more bleak and volatile planet, and in human terms one that is likely to lead to the forced displacement of millions of people including those at the front line in small island developing countries,” Mr Higgins said.He addressed the decision by the Trump administration to exit the Paris accord, expressing his “profound disappointment” at the move.“I do urge the United States Government to revisit and reconsider this decision to exit the Paris agreement, a decision which could take effect from November next year,” he said.“Unless we collectively take action to prevent catastrophic climate change, together with a real commitment and transfer of resources towards assisting communities to prepare for, and adapt to, changing climates, these population flows, driven by climate shifts, will take place in a context of old revived and emerging new conflicts becoming available to be exploited by extremists,” he said.Keynote addressMr Higgins was speaking ahead of a keynote address to the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. Earlier, the President said that he believed Ireland had a “good case to make” for securing a seat on the UN Security Council in 2021 and 2022.Noting that much of the decision-making is made by the five big members of the security council, he noted that small countries have historically been able to effect change on the security council. Noting that about 100 of the UN member states have populations the same or less than Ireland he said: “They are actually the ones who speak on issues like proliferation, cluster bombs, disarmament and climate change.”Mr Higgins defended his own practices in relation to climate change, as well as those practiced in Áras an Uachtaráin, noting that he planned to travel by ship to Athens and Cyprus in October, while he regularly travels to Belfast by train.In his speech at New York University on Tuesday evening, he also said that Ireland “believes profoundly” in the United Nations, highlighting how Ireland, like the United Nations itself, emerged from conditions of conflict. Ireland’s “long and painful” escape from a colonial past means that it can empathise with so many countries in the UN he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4029264.1569367150!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"students on thunberg at the end of the day it is our planet","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents at Dublin’s O’Connell Secondary School, from left, McKenzie O’Connor, Bepo Jacan, Tighe O’Driscoll and Arseniy Kuznecovs. Photograph: Tom HonanSixteen-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg might be just one inidual but for students attending Dublin’s O’Connell Secondary School, she is not alone. Her message on climate change broadcast from New York City last week, when she led the Global Climate Strike, and her comments delivered to the assembled leaders at the United Nations on Monday resonated deeply with students. “She is inspirational when you think of what she can do at such an age,” said Arseniy Kuznelovs (16). “I’ve seen a few talks of hers and she mentioned how much one kid can do. I think that is an accurate statement – can you imagine what all of us could do if we teamed up?” Fifth-year student Bepo Jacan, who is also 16, said: “I remember when she said the Earth was on fire. I really liked that point. When we think of the Amazon rain forest and everything that has happened there over the last few months, we need to do something or the Earth is going to die. Everything is going the wrong way currently. But she is really making a difference especially when it comes to the younger generation.”Teenagers see life through a different lens and students at the 191-year-old school on North Richmond Street agreed Thunberg’s age should not cloud opinions.Not like adults“It is different when you get an opinion from another age group who see things differently and not like adults,” says Arseniy. “They shouldn’t really be devaluing anything she says – they should be taking it into account like any other person.”The youngest of the students The  spoke to, 13-year-old McKenzie O’Connor, agreed, and while he thought the younger generation should be listened to more “they think young people are irresponsible”, he said. Tighe O’Driscoll (14), a second-year student, has helped plan an aquaponic garden for the school and, for him, no change is too small.“Of course there are changes people can make,” he said. “For instance, we bring in our own reusable water bottles which stops us from buying plastic water bottles. It’s the small things. It’s not going to save the planet – but it is us doing our part.”A year ago Thunberg was sitting outside a school in Sweden and just 12 months later she was at the head of a social movement that has held marches in 150 countries across the world. “I think what she has done is a great thing,” said Tighe. “From just one girl on her own to attracting millions of views and millions of people around the world trying to support her. “And, at the end of the day, it is our planet and we should be the ones that should save it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Police say situation returning to normal as rescue operation gets under wayRocks hurled at parliament over Bill to curb extramarital sex and insulting presidentHardcore group of protesters says extreme actions needed to get government\u0026rsquos attention\u0026lsquoThis can only be fantasy\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash Greta Thunberg in New York, responding to global actionCommunist Party gears up to dictate who will be reincarnated as the next Dalai LamaVerdict on Tokyo Electric Power bosses comes in only criminal case brought after 2011 meltdownFurther 40 injured after attack in which labourers and farmers accidentally targetedNeil Parker (54) fell down waterfall while walking alone on Mount Nebo in QueenslandOkinawa Letter: Growing resistance to a new military base is rooted in war-time traumaBillionaire Terry Gou\u0026rsquos withdrawal could help unite pro-Beijing opposition partySuicide bomber kills 26 in attack at rally for Afghan president claimed by TalibanPell is highest ranking Catholic in world convicted of child sex offencesHotel guests stuck in buildings and racing pigeons banned before October 1st celebrationsFears of escalating tensions as sensitive Chinese anniversary approachesShops close their doors as thousands take to the streets seeking pro-democracy reformsPro-Beijing and pro-democracy demonstrators exchange punches as police orders defiedFamilies face rupture after India declared some 1.9m people to be \u0026lsquooutlawed\u0026rsquoCarrie Lam\u0026rsquos withdrawal of the tabled extradition Bill was only one of five demands being called for by demonstratorsShops, schools and offices empty in response to lockdown and looming rule by New DelhiLaunch comes hours after North offers to resume nuclear diplomacy with US"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter -

The period granted is unusually short for a private hire licence. TfL could have granted a new term of up to five years.The transport body\u0026nbsppreviously removed Uber’s right to operate in the city in September 2017 due to alleged failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks.The decision prompted legal action, which led to a judge granting the Silicon Valley company a probationary 15-month licence in 2018 after it made several changes to its business model in London.London is one of the most important markets for the firm in Europe.A TfL spokesman said: “Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern \u0026amp Eastern Europe, said the decision demonstrated TfL’s recognition of the company’s “improved culture and governance”.\u0026nbsp“We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information,” he said.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our Clean Air Plan is helping to tackle air pollution.”Uber launches helicopter service between Manhattan and JFK airportHowever, unions claimed that TfL was still failing to properly regulate Uber.James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the\u0026nbspIndependent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB)\u0026nbspsaid: “Once again, TfL’s failure to regulate effectively and Uber’s unwillingness to play by the rules has led to the jobs of 40,000 Uber drivers being thrown into uncertainty. Sadiq Khan must use this two-month license review period to insist Uber respect UK employment law as a condition of license.”The London Taxi Drivers’ Association described Uber as a “threat to public safety”.LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: “Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator’s licence ever shows the Mayor doesn’t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.“It’s time the Mayor pulled the plug on Uber’s immoral operation for good.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The hosts were on the end of a thumping, as Australia won the first test by 251 runsWilf Gillett Coles, who is due to study physics at the university in October, was left without housing. He told Inside Out on BBC West: “Most people haven’t lived anywhere on their own and halls can be quite a nice transition period but we don’t have that.“We’ve just been thrown out into the wind.”Grace Whittaker, another student who had no accommodation, was told that there was\u0026nbsphousing in Langford, in North Somerset, and in\u0026nbspNewport – which is more than 30 miles away and in a different country.She said: “If you know how big the courses are, you know how many spaces you have for students and you know how many halls you have for students – so why give out so many offers and why let people through clearing if we are not going to have accommodation?”A record number of students across the country took up places on degrees through clearing this year.Competition between universities to recruit students, who pay £9,250 a year, has grown as there are fewer 18-year-olds in the population and yet student numbers at institutions\u0026nbspremain uncapped.\u0026nbspUniversities across the UK\u0026nbsphave been expanding in recent years – and the number of students at Bristol has risen by 15 per cent in three years, from 21,555 in 2014-15 to 24,850 in 2017-18.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Especially in first year it felt as if everyone was pushing into each other to sit there,” he said. “They are trying to stretch each course as much as possible.”Mr Braakman added that he thought the university was accepting too many people – similar to airlines overbooking flights.He said: “If I knew about the housing situation in Bristol, if it was transparent that there was not much accommodation in general, then I wouldn’t choose Bristol.”Mr Bemrose told The Independent:\u0026nbsp“There are still a number of postgraduate and Erasmus students who are struggling to find accommodation in the private market.”“I still think there is work that needs to be done to ensure all students are getting the help they need,” he added. “We need to prevent a similar situation happening in the future.”Eva Crossan Jory, vice president for welfare at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: “The fact that flying to and from university is a cheaper and simpler option than renting is a damning example of the housing crisis students are facing.“Universities are simply not doing enough to ensure all their students have access to affordable, safe and decent accommodation from the start.”Sarah Purdy, who is responsible for student wellbeing at the University of Bristol, said she was “really sorry” to hear students were anxious about a lack of accommodation.But she said the process was similar each year and it will be “same in every university” in the UK.Ms Purdy added: “I think this year there were larger numbers of students involved in the process in part because we had fewer students who decided to defer or withdraw from the guaranteed offer.”But she insisted that the university had not “let students in, over and above the numbers” it had planned to admit.A University of Bristol spokesperson said: “Colleagues in our accommodation team have been working incredibly hard over the past few weeks to inidually support those students who were not part of the 6,000 students we have already placed in university-owned or university-managed accommodation.“As each day has passed we have managed to bring down the number still looking for suitable accommodation and before our students started to arrive this weekend we were able to offer every student accommodation in Bristol or at our Langford campus.”They added: “We believe our website and the information we supply to students gaining a place at Bristol is clear about the accommodation we can offer and the processes we follow. We are sorry if Sohail or any other student feels it is not clear.“We always look to see where our processes can be improved and\u0026nbsp we will review our communications as part of this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is how our interactions in VR and AR can one day look. It can change the way we connect.”Mr Bosworth goes on to explain exactly how this technology works, stating: “You have neurons in your spinal cord that send electrical signals to your hand muscles telling them to move in specific ways such as to click a mouse or press a button.“The wristband will decode those signals and translate them into a digital signal your device can understand, empowering you with control over your digital life.”Following Facebook\u0027s announcement of the acquisition, CTRL-Labs shared a message across its social media platforms that it is thrilled  to join Facebook Reality Labs, however not everyone was happy about the news.Recent scandals involving how Facebook handles and uses people\u0027s personal data raised some questions about the ethics of such technology being used by the company.Great for them, disappointing for the rest of us, wrote tech analyst Azeem Azhar. Facebook needs to inveigle itself into our lives less, not more.CTRL-Labs’ wristband is not the only brain-computer interface that Facebook will be working on, having already unveiled a headset capable of transferring a person’s thoughts directly onto a computer screen.A paper describing the mind-reading technology was published in\u0026nbspNature Communications\u0026nbspearlier this year, revealing how the headset can decode brain activity to instantly transcribe what a person is saying into digital text.“We’re standing on the edge of the next great wave of human-oriented computing,” Facebook said at the time.\u0026nbsp“One in which the combined technologies of AR and VR converge and revolutionise how we interact with the world around us – as well as the ways in which we workm play, and connect.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It also raises questions about how to enforce differing jurisdictions when it comes to the borderless internet.The case stems from the EU court’s 2014 ruling that people have the right to control what appears when their name is searched online. That decision forced Google to delete links to outdated or embarrassing personal information that popped up in searches within the 28-nation bloc.One year later, the French privacy watchdog wanted Google to remove results on all its search engines on request, and not just those appearing on European country sites like google.fr.Now, the EU court said that such application to territories outside the EU was not legal. It said it was “not apparent” from the EU legal text “that it would have intended to impose on an operator, such as Google, a de-referencing obligation which also concerns the national versions of its search engine that do not correspond to the member states.”Those who wanted to see such an extension argue that on the internet it is easy to switch from the national versions of the website to ones outside the EU – by switching from google.fr to google for example – to find the information that must be removed within the EU.Since 2014, Google has received more than 845,000 requests to remove more than 3 million web addresses from its results. Around 45 per cent of “right to be forgotten” requests have been successful.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Usually, Apple releases the new version of iOS for its tablet and phone at the same time, but that was also delayed.This year is the first time Apple officially split the two different platforms apart, creating iPadOS as distinct from iOS for iPhone. That presumably helped Apple delay, since the two are now separate products.New iPhone update will include bugs and have missing featuresIt initially said iOS 13.1 and iPadOS would arrive on 30 September. It appears it has been finished earlier than expected, and will arrive later today – most likely around 6pm UK time or 10am local pacific time.It will be available to download as normal, by heading to the Settings app, clicking general and choosing the software update version. iPhones can also update themselves automatically, meaning that it will prompt a user to update overnight if they do not do so manually.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The period granted is unusually short for a private hire licence. TfL could have granted a new term of up to five years.The transport body\u0026nbsppreviously removed Uber’s right to operate in the city in September 2017 due to alleged failings in its approach to reporting serious criminal offences and driver background checks.The decision prompted legal action, which led to a judge granting the Silicon Valley company a probationary 15-month licence in 2018 after it made several changes to its business model in London.London is one of the most important markets for the firm in Europe.A TfL spokesman said: “Uber London Limited has been granted a two-month private hire operator licence to allow for scrutiny of additional information that we are requesting ahead of consideration of any potential further licensing application.”Jamie Heywood, Uber’s regional general manager for Northern \u0026amp Eastern Europe, said the decision demonstrated TfL’s recognition of the company’s “improved culture and governance”.\u0026nbsp“We will continue to work closely with TfL and provide any additional requested information,” he said.“Over the past two years, we’ve launched a range of new safety features in the app, introduced better protections for drivers and our Clean Air Plan is helping to tackle air pollution.”Uber launches helicopter service between Manhattan and JFK airportHowever, unions claimed that TfL was still failing to properly regulate Uber.James Farrar, chair of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the\u0026nbspIndependent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB)\u0026nbspsaid: “Once again, TfL’s failure to regulate effectively and Uber’s unwillingness to play by the rules has led to the jobs of 40,000 Uber drivers being thrown into uncertainty. Sadiq Khan must use this two-month license review period to insist Uber respect UK employment law as a condition of license.”The London Taxi Drivers’ Association described Uber as a “threat to public safety”.LTDA general secretary Steve McNamara said: “Over the last 15 months Uber was supposed to change its operations for the better, but the firm has continued to shirk its responsibilities. The granting of the shortest operator’s licence ever shows the Mayor doesn’t trust Uber, and neither should Londoners.“It’s time the Mayor pulled the plug on Uber’s immoral operation for good.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it were about science it would be led by scientists, not politicians and a mentally ill Swedish child who is being exploited by her parents and by the international left.”When challenged by left-wing pundit Chris Hahn, Mr Knowles reiterated that she “has many mental illnesses”.His comments came after the teenager gave a severe and impassioned speech to the United Nations climate change summit, telling world leaders and officials from about 60 countries “I shouldn’t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet, you all come to us young people for hope? How dare you.

Umar’s wife was among six Pakistani women and a Bangladeshi national arrested, and a huge cache of weapons was recovered.Tribal leaders, politicians and officials in Helmand, however, disputed this account and accused the US and Afghan forces of killing around 40 civilians, most of them returning from a wedding party on Sunday night, many of them women and children.Hamid Karzai, the former Afghan president, has been among public figures who has condemned the deaths and called for an investigation into what happened.Created with Sketch.Afghanistan war: lives of children devastated by the endless conflict Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andrew QuiltySave the Children220 Nooria*, 15 in the home her family has lived in for the past two years in Mazar-i SharifShe was forced to flee her home with her family after their town was attacked by armed groups.

It is not known to have a strong presence in India, but has received support from some Kashmiri separatist groups, including Anasurut-Tawhid Wai Jihad Kashmir.Four years ago, US forces raided an AQIS training facility in Kandahar, where they are believed to have established bases before branching out to Helmand, the former centre of British operations in Afghanistan.

Because of the heavy fighting, we did conduct targeted precision strikes against barricaded terrorists firing on Afghan and US forces.”US officials say that they are attempting to establish whether women, apart from the ones they had captured, may have been hiding in the compound when the shooting and air strikes were taking place.Mohammed Zaman Hamdard, an official with the Helmand police force, said that the al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters had fled into people’s homes during the raid and started shooting from there, drawing fire back in response. As a result “three women are among the dead, and three children are wounded”, he stated.Karim Atal, a member of Helmand’s Provincial Council, said it had not been possible to obtain reliable information because mobile phones were not working in the area. US-led forces jam signals as a matter of routine during operations. “Some say 14 civilians were killed, others says 60, many are saying 40,” he said.Abdul Majid Akhunzada, a fellow council member, claimed that at least 12 people from a wedding party were wounded in the air strike, but he was unaware of their identities. Omar Zowak, a spokesman for the Helmand Governorate, claimed that three cars had been hit from the air, but the numbers of wounded were unclear.Read the first part of the Conflict Without End series here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan election marred by bloodshed and corruption and the second part here:\u0026nbspAfghanistan families torn apart by deadly carnage: ‘My grandson will have to see more dead bodies when he grows up’Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The tribunal found evidence they were “being used as a bank of organs” and subjected to regular medical testing.China has repeatedly denied the use of unethical organ transplant practices, and said that it stopped using the organs from executed prisoners in 2015. In a statement earlier this year, it accused the London-based China Tribunal of perpetuating “rumours”.But Sir Geoffrey, also speaking on Tuesday at a separate NGO-hosted UN event, said the evidence collated by the tribunal meant the international community “can no longer avoid what it is inconvenient for them to admit”.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sir Geoffrey called on the International Transplant Society and national medical associations dealing with transplant surgery to “face up to what is revealed in the China Tribunal judgment and act”.\u0026nbspSome countries, including Italy, Spain, Israel and Taiwan, already have restrictions in place for those seeking to travel to China for organ transplant surgery.And the International Coalition to End Transplant Abuse in China (Etac), which initiated the China Tribunal, said it expects a private members bill to stop unethical organ tourism will be tabled in the UK parliament in October.Etac is hoping its findings will prompt the Human Rights Council to open up a UN Commission of Inquiry into forced organ harvesting in China, said Susie Hughes, the organisation’s executive director.In his speech, Mr Sabi said\u0026nbspthat the targeting of minority groups for organ harvesting amounted to a “possible charge of genocide”, and compared it to other examples of mass religious or racial persecution in recent history.“Victim for victim and death for death, the gassing of the Jews by the Nazis, the massacre by the Khmer Rouge or the butchery to death of the Rwanda Tutsis may not be worse than cutting out the hearts and other organs from living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people,” he told the Human Rights Council. “It is the legal obligation of UN Member States to address this criminal conduct.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

After a month-long tour of Europe, Trix is home in time for the opening of the new museum“It is quite simply a geological mess” Mr van Hinsbergen added, “everything is curved, broken, and stacked. Compared to this, the Himalayas, for example, represent a rather simple system. There you can follow several large fault lines across a distance of more than 2000 km.’Much of the rest of the remaining mass sank below the waters to the west of the country, covered by coral reefs, shallow seas and sediments. Those sediments went on to form rocks, which in turn were scraped off as the continent sank beneath tectonic plates leaving mountain ranges in the Alps, Apennines, Balkans, Greece and Turkey.The vast stretch of land covered by the continent\u0026nbspmeant the region\u0027s history required further unpicking by scientists, who combatted with each nation’s understanding of the geological backstory as they mapped its evolution from the Triassic period.Mr van Hinsbergen said: “This is not only a large region, but it also hosts more than 30 countries. Each of these has its own geological survey, own maps, and own ideas about the evolutionary history.“Research often stops at the national borders. Therefore, the region is not just fragmented from a geological perspective.”It is not the first time lost land masses have been discovered. In 2017 researchers from South Africa\u0027s University of Witwatersrand found the island of Mauritius was sitting on top of an undiscovered fragment of the 200-million-year-old super-continent Gondwana, which split to form Africa, South America, Antarctica, India and Australia about 180 million years ago.New Zealand was also found to have been sitting on top of a much larger mass\u0026nbspdubbed Zealandia -\u0026nbspmost of which sits underneath the South Pacific and so can’t be seen, according to researchers from the nation’s official geological body GNS Science.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We were promised that we would.But a half-hearted and incompetent strategy from Theresa May, alongside a well-funded, relentless campaign to undermine the referendum and the Government’s negotiating position, has left us still in the EU after three years of drt and doom-mongering.Matters have been made worse by Speaker John Bercow’s bias, which has brought Parliament into disrepute.But in response, Jeremy Corbyn is in danger of adopting a still more absurd and tragic position, urged by senior figures Emily Thornberry and John McDonnell.To renegotiate a deal, to put it to yet another referendum, and then to campaign against that deal and in favour of remaining in the EU after all.What a self-defeating proposition. To give credit to the EU negotiators, they have played hardball all along and used every trick to avoid concessions.Imagine how they would negotiatethey knew that our Government would be committed to telling the public to reject that deal afterwards!Unfortunately, this policy may become a reality. All too many activist delegates to Labour Conference are out of touch with the history and the values of the party, and do not respect traditional voters’ opposition to EU federalism and neoliberalism.This is leading to anger and disillusionment in leave voting areas, which a majority of Labour MPs represent. Many decent, patriotic Labour voters feel alienated by the suggestion they were at best foolish to vote to Leave and should know better next time.Labour should take warning. Labour voters in seats we must win to take seize power may never dream of voting Conservative. BUT they now have a credible option.The Brexit Party has a clear promise to follow through on the referendum vote. It includes left-wing MEPs and cannot be dismissed as simply UKIP mark II.If Labour does not recognise this danger and recommit to our existing policy of honouring Brexit, its future may be bleak.

It doesnt matter where you are, were all trying to power through and find some optimism.She and Prince Harry, who wore a green shirt and grey trousers, appeared in good spirits as they joined in the welcome Kilo - a welcoming call and response game.The couple later headed to Auwal Mosque, the oldest mosque in South Africa, to meet with representatives of dferent faith groups.Meghan wore a head covering for the visit to the religious centre as they were given a tour around the building.Harry also gushed about their amazing trip so far - saying: This Africa tour was always going to be fantastic, been looking forward to Cape Town - her first visit, I love this place.And again meeting the people, the energy, the fun, again the positivity, the optimism and the hope in the face of such incredible adversity.There are young people and older people, men and women trying to change what effectively has become the norm.He said he was particularly keeping track of violence against women, distressed to see numbers recently peak.Meghan looked stunning for the visit, but chose not to wear her engagement ring for the South Africa tour.Instead, she is wearing her wedding ring along with a thin ring with a turquoise stone.It is unclear why she has gone without wearing her ring, however it has been suggested she has wanted to be low key during the visit.The duchess also made sure to visit workers at the Lunchbox Fund, an organisation which provides daily meals for South African schoolchildren.The charity is one Meghan and Harry asked supporters to donate to after baby Archie was born in May.And after their visit to the beach, the couple then split off, with Meghan expected to stay back with baby Archie while Prince Harry set out for his duties of Captain General of the Royal Marines.The Duke was soaked in water as he travelled with the City of Cape Town Marine Unit by boat to learn about poaching of abalone.The couple are expected to be reunited at Bo Kaap in celebration of Heritage Day, a South African public holiday, later today.It comes after the couple gave royal fans a glimpse of baby Archie as they touched down on the continent yesterday.And surrounded by young women who have benefited from a female empowerment programme teaching them self-defence, the duchess took the unusual step of highlighting her mixed-race heritage.In a powerful speech to the hosts, Meghan said: “On a personal note while I’m here as a member of the royal family, I’m here with you as a mother, as a we, as a woman, as a woman of colour and as your sister.Please know that my husband and I have been closely following what you’ve been experiencing here — as best we can from afar.But now that we are with you, we are eager to learn and see first-hand the work that you’re doing, the vital work that you’re doing.And that everything that is being done on the ground is making the great change that you not only need but that you deserve. "},{"url":null,"title":"steve irwin family feud recluse bob australia zoo","story":"He has reportedly not spoken to his tragic son’s we and kids for more than ten years and lives behind a chained-up gate, with signs ordering people to stay clear.Bobs estrangement from his close-knit family is said to have happened after  when he quit Australia Zoo having fallen out with his daughter-in-law Terri over the running of the zoo.This was two years after Steve died aged  in Batt Reef when a stingrays barb pierced his heart.Hints of strained relations became apparent earlier this month, when -year-old Bob said he didnt expect to be invited to his granddaughter Bindis wedding.Bob now lives in a secluded  acre property called Camp Chilli, which borders a national park, reports Daily Mail Australia. Locals say Bob has become a “recluse” in recent years.One said: “Hes quiet [when I see him], just goes about his business and leaves.“I think he just wants to be left alone.”Bob opened the Beerwah Reptile Park on June , , with his late we Lyn. The pair started on just four acres of land, and lived in a caravan until they built the young family a home on the property.It was there that Steves interest in animals became apparent as he started helping his parents care for the crocodiles and reptiles.Daugher Bindi, now , has previously shared her views on the family feud and claims her grieving grandad cut himself off from her and her brother Robert who is .She reportedly said: Everyone deals with grief dferently.When my dad passed away hechose to distance himself from everything that dad loved the most.At the moment were really just respecting his wishes because he hasnt had anything to do with us for a long time and he decided his own path.Bindi even claimed Bob rejected birthday presents from them on one occasion.She said: He opened them up and he sent them back.Joy Muscillo, Steves older sister, meanwhile told the Daily Mail she has also fallen out with the family.In , she claimed Terri walked her husband Frank out of the zoo.

Prince Andrew would certainly be an obvious person to assist with this enquiry. He is clearly deeply involved in this case.Epstein was arrested on July  by FBI agents after he landed at Teterboro airport in New Jersey following a flight from Paris Le Bourget airport in his private jet.US prosecutors had alleged that Epstein  ‘sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls’ from  to  at his properties in New York and Florida.Epstein – who faced  years in prison – had entered a not guilty plea when he appeared before judges on July .Key witness Virginia Roberts said had also frequently been sent to France to serve as his sex slave when she was still a minor.Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said that Epstein’s victims also included two -year-old girls who had been sent to him from France by one of his friends as a surprise birthday present.Beyond Ms Maxwell, those alleged to have taken part in this sex trafficking included the French fashion scout Jean-Luc Brunel.Both Maxwell and Brunel have firmly denied any wrongdoing.Roberts claims she was first recruited by Maxwell, who has joint British and French nationality, to work as a masseuse to Epstein when she was aged .Following a criminal conviction in the USA in , Epstein was placed on a sex offenders register and served  months of a prison sentence.Epstein spent three weeks at his Paris apartment before his arrest, and had frequently stayed there before this time too.Referring to the time Epstein had boasted about abusing two -year-old girls, Roberts said: It was a surprise birthday gt from one of his friends and they were from France. I did see them, I did meet them.Jeffrey bragged afterwards after he met them that they were -year-olds and flown over from France because theyre really poor over there, and their parents needed the money, or whatever the case is, and they were absolutely free to stay and flew out.The girls, who may have been from Eastern European, would now be aged around .Ghislaine Maxwell has called Roberts a liar, prompting her to launch a defamation suit against Maxwell in .In legal depositions connection to this libel case, Roberts said:  I also had sexual intercourse with Jean-Luc Brunel many times when I was  through  years old.He was another of Epstein’s powerful friends who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world.In fact, his only similarity with Epstein and the only link to their friendship appeared to be that Brunel could get dozens of underage girls and feed Epstein’sstrong appetite for sex with minors.The libel case Roberts brought against Maxwell was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount in , and so never went to trial.Roberts allegations about Prince Andrew were struck from the US court record for being immaterial and impertinent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While a large percentage of the younger generation are genuinely concerned about the planet — and rightly so — how many of them are actually going to do their bit beyond the enviable opportunity to skip school on a sunny day and virtue signal with a hand-made banner Deliciously tempting though it may be to blame their parents, the simple truth is that up to  years ago, no one had even heard of climate change.Far from worrying about the planet heating up, I distinctly remember our geography teacher telling us that a mini ice age was coming.In the meantime, I walked or cycled to school every day, wore jumpers indoors in winter because we didn’t have central heating and baked in the stling heat of the summer of ’ in classrooms without the luxury of air-con.There were no ready meals, we ate simple food cooked by mothers who had grown up with rationing, the vast supermarkets of today didn’t exist and we didn’t have a freezer.The only “takeaway” in easy reach was a fish and chip shop and the first time we ever ate out was when I scraped a couple of O-level passes and my mum took me to the local Berni Inn to celebrate.Our milk came in glass bottles, we ate locally grown, seasonal fruit and vegetablesand I didn’t set eyes on an avocado or any other exotic foodstuff until well into adulthood.At school, I was taught to mend things, not throw them away, would wear something several times before my mother would even think about washing it, and only received new clothesat Christmas or on birthdays.We had one TV, didn’t even get a landline until I was and I didn’t go abroad until I was  — by boat, not plane.No one went on “a gap yah” and my mum would have killed meI left our tent at Glastonbury, because we used it for holidays in Wales.I could go on, but the younger generation’s collective eye-roll of boredom might cause a damaging tremor.Suffice to say,today’s kids are happy to strip their lives back to reflect the childhood we had, it would be a great step towards helping the planet. But it’s not going to happen.So, instead of the lame, “old people have ruined everything for young people”, mantra, all generations should be working together to not only do their bit at homebut to continue putting pressure on those who govern us and have the power to effect realistic, not idealistic, change for a planet that currently accommodates seven and a half billion people.Then the admirable young Greta can go back to school and get on with having a normal le.THE Duchess of Sussex has learned the hard way that making inclusive speeches and appearing accessible has its pitfalls.In other words, someone might ask you to dance.

Only a ­couple of weeks ago some Christian “End is nigh” nutter was roaming the market and the show had no qualms about introducing Rev Lucas Johnson, who was driven to kill by his Christianity.This slanted agenda defines EastEnders as much as all its murders, rapes and abductions.The only thing that’s changed here, since the dawn of time , is the amount of ­scrutiny and competition it gets, which, given that ratings have recovered, means the misery will probably continue indefinitely.Still, on the positive side, Adam Woodyatt’s tenderloin of Iberico pork, with parsnip three ways, has seen him through to the next round of Celebrity MasterChef.#PrideOfWalford.Sent in by the brilliant Reenie E.Picture research: Marta Ovod.STRICTLY Come Dancing came out of the traps like Johnny Vegas on the opening leg of a x metres relay on Saturday.Two weeks they’ve been rehearsing and viewers still aren’t trusted enough to vote.Instead, the contestants laid out their nervous credentials over  testing minutes.“Eighteen years in the Premiership and I’ve never been as nervous as . . . ”We know, we know.There was an awful lot of “great energy” flannel from the judges as well, including Craig Revel Horwood, who needs to ignore any “be more positive” instructions.This ’s already compromised enough by the fact Motsi Mabuse’s sister Oti has – by accident rather than design – ended up with Kelvin Fletcher, who’s one of the favourites.Mercully, there are two dancers no amount of “great energy” can save. One is James Cracknell, whose tango had more than a touch of the Boris Karloffs about it.The other is BBC reporter Mike Bushell, who did a sailor’s hornpipe to The Contours with double nork-grab to finish, accompanied by the insatiable Katya Jones, who sounds like she still won’t take no for an answer.“Even when I was in bed, next to my we,” complained Mike, “Katya’s saying, ‘Give me five, give me five, give me five’.”Mike.

Itaposs fair to say Labouraposs conference has been pretty overshadowed this week. And some of the time, it hasnapost even been the partyaposs own fault.Jeremy Corbyn moved his keynote speech forward by  hours and stripped out key policies to save them for a rainy day after he rushed back to Parliament.But even so, Labouraposs conference has been beavering away passing some of the most radical policies youaposve seen.Crisis or no crisis, these massive policies would become government policyLabour wins an election before Christmas.So just in case they passed you by, hereaposs a summary of what they actually are. . Make all NHS prescriptions free in England  Prescription charges will be abolished in England under a Labour government. The dramatic change would bring England in line with the rest of the UK and save money for millions of patients. Prescriptions are currently free for patients living in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but cost £ per item for those in England who do not qualy for an exemption. The party said the fees can be a burden for people with long-term conditions such as asthma and chronic kidney disease who can spend up to £ a year on medication - and pointed to research which suggested the charges put people off collecting prescribed medicine. Brits would work just  hours a week with no loss of pay within a decade under a radical new policy announced by the Labour Party.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell today vowed to drastically cut average full-time hourshe gets into  Downing Street.The proposal - which would cut average weekly hours from the current . - goes even further than a sensible target that was put forward this month in a review for Labour.John McDonnellaposs pledge stops short of making  hours a week compulsory - instead is says only average hours would be cut. And it does not explicitly mention a four-day week, focusing on hours per week instead. But Mr McDonnell said millions are exhausted from overwork and that must end.  Labour committed to scrap public schools after an abolish Eton motion passed overwhelmingly.  It means the election manesto will have to commit to integrate all private schools into the state sector. This would include withdrawal of charitable status and all other public subsidies and tax privileges, including business rate exemption. The policy, which came from the grassroots, passed overwhemingly on conference floor and was endorsed by the Education Secretary Angela Rayner.In he speech she said Labour will make “the whole education system fairer through the integration of private schools”.It went further than the partyaposs plan to close the tax loopholes used by the elite private schools.  After a major push by left-wing members, Labour committed to work towards a net-zero carbon emissions target by . The ambitious plan won a vote at the partyaposs annual conference after days of isive debates over the target. The Labouraposs Socialist Green New Deal motion calls for the party to work towards a net-zero target for carbon emissions by .The GMB union, one of the three largest who are affiliated to Labour , have consistently opposed the  target throughout the conference which began on Saturday afternoon.Instead they want to see a less ambitious target because of concerns about potential job losses without a plan in place to adapt heavy industry. But itaposs still a lot more ambitious than the governmentaposs target of net zero emissions by . Hundreds of thousands of frail elderly people will get free care in their own homes under a Labour policy.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell will set out plans for a National Care Service, which would more than double the number getting state-funded help in their old age. The new service, running alongside the NHS, is one of the key demands in the Mirror’s Fair Care For All campaign and would cost an estimated £billion in  . Those in need would get help with everyday tasks such as getting in and out of bed, bathing and washing, and preparing meals.    . Reparations for our colonial past Labour have begun outlining how they would make reparations for the UKaposs colonial past. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said that one way will be for the UK to share green technology with its former colonies. The policy comes out of the belief that the UK should take responsibility for the role its industrial legacy in polluting the world. It came after Shadow Women and Equalities Minister Dawn Butler also said there must be further reparations paid from slavery after Glasgow University agreed to make available £million. She said: Other banks and businesses must follow. Labour will begin with consultation hubs in Liverpool, Bristol, Glasgow and London.  Thirty-seven new offshore wind farms will be builtLabour enters government, the party has pledged. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said there would be a % public stake in the farms, with profits invested into coastal communities.The cost of offshore wind tumbled below £ per megawatt hour of electricity last week, but Labour said deployment was too slow and that jobs and revenue were being taken outside the UK.Instead, under Labouraposs plans, a peopleaposs power fund would be created with % of the profits from the publicly owned stake, which would invest between £ to £, million each year into infrastructure in held-back coastal communities. The rest of the public profits would be reinvested into new renewables, improvements to the energy system and climate transition. Overall £billion would be invested over a decade in a peopleaposs power initiative from multiple sources. . End all food bank use within  years Labour has set a dramatic target to halve food bank use a year after Jeremy Corbyn enters Downing Street. And the party will aim to end the need for food banks completely within just three years of office. The ambitious pledges were unveiled after the number of emergency food parcels handed out by the Trussell Trust charity soared to .million last year. The targets will not be legally binding and food banks will not be shut down to meet them.But they would lay down the gauntlet to an incoming Prime Minister to stop Brits going hungry under a Labour government.Green-fingered Jeremy Corbyn will also oversee a £m fund for allotments - alongside other measures like community kitchens and healthy eating classes in  deprived areas. And Labour will announce plans for a Fair Food Act to ensure everyone in the UK has a legal right to food, similar to other human rights. The new law would create a National Food Commission - an independent body that could take legal action against the government or councilsthey breached peopleaposs rights.    . Ending almost all -month or less jail terms A future Labour government would legislate for a presumption to end ineffective super-short sentences of six months or fewer for non-violent and non-sexual offences. An independent review into how the justice system is handling rape would also be launched, Richard Burgon said, amid concerns over low conviction rates.

Attorney General Geoffrey Cox also faces ­questions over his part in the suspension of parliament by advising the PM it was legal.As Mr Johnson sought refuge in the company of pal Donald Trump , Jeremy Corbyn led the chorus of criticism over his unlawful five-week prorogation – which  Supreme Court justices ruled had an “extreme” effect on democracy.Boris Johnonaposs  days is well short of Tory George Canning, who served  days before dying in August .

He is part of an elite that disdains democracy. I don’t think he’s fit to be Prime Minister.” Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson echoed Mr Corbyn’s words and added of Mr Johnson: “He’s misled Queen and country, and unlawfully silenced the people’s representatives.”   SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was Boris Johnson who took the decision to prorogue Parliament. It was Boris Johnson who acted unlawfully, and I do not say this lightly, but it is Boris Johnson who must now resign.”Others turned their anger on Mr Johnson’s key aide Dominic Cummings, widely thought to be behind the lurch towards a no-deal. Brexit Party Nigel Farage said: “The calling of a Queen’s Speech and prorogation is the worst political decision ever. Dominic Cummings must go.” Downing St refused to sayMr Johnson had apologised to the monarch for not being honest about why he wanted to suspend Parliament.  He had claimed it was simply so he could get a Queen’s speech together as a new PM – but a Scottish court ruled he closed the doors on the Commons and the Lords to “stymie” debate in a bid to run down the clock on a no-deal Brexit.

Commons Speaker John Bercow triggered urgent talks with party leaders within minutes. He said: “The House of Commons must convene without delay.” He declared Parliament would be open for business as usual at .am today.  Since taking the keys to No, Mr Johnson has lost all six Commons votes so far along with his ­Parliamentary majority, sacked  MPs and been caught misleading the Queen. That unenviable record would be enough to make most PMs quit. But Downing St insisted Mr Johnson had no plans to step down. Labour confirmed it would not table a ­confidence vote in the PM when Parliament s until they have a “locked in” guarantee against a no-deal Brexit.

Mr Hutchison, , his we Charrelle, , and their son, Leo, five, had to leave the hotel as they did not have enough cash to meet bossesapos demands.    Along with pals Leigh Crombie, his partner Vicki Butchart and their son Archie, four, the gutted holidaymakers spent yesterday trying to find somewhere to sleep.

And , tourists stranded worldwide are being brought back to the UK by the Civil Aviation Authorityunder Operation Matterhorn – a £million flight programme.  Dylan and his party, from Glenrothes, in Scotland, had flown from Edinburgh Airport to the Spanish resort last Wednesday for a week’s stay. They had booked the holiday last September and paid £, for each family-of-three. Dylan said: “It had been a great holiday until this happened. “Then we woke up and saw on the news that Thomas Cook had gone bust. We went to the hotel’s reception to try and check what was happening.    “We were then told by the head of reception thatwe didn’t pay €, for each of the families by pm, we would be removed from the hotel. She told us that was coming straight from the company director. “They claimed that was the hotel bill for the week even though we’d already paid Thomas Cook. “They said although we were Atol-protected, the hotel would be on the bottom of the pile to receive payment from any liquidators. “I contacted the CAA, who spoke to reception via my mobile phone but the hotel was adamant they were not accepting any guarantee of payment. It was pay €, or leave. “We didn’t have the money to pay it evenwe wanted to. “So we had to pack up our cases and hand over the room keys. We were left on the street.” The families went to a nearby bar to find shelter out of the C sunshine while they tried to find another place to stay. After a number of hours, they managed to find an apartment online costing £, along with a £ deposit, to stay in until they fly out.    Dylan, who works as a master technician, said: “It was all-inclusive package holiday with Thomas Cook which included meals, drinks and a shuttle transfer to Alicante Airport. “Our airline was easyJet so we’re told the flights back to Edinburgh Airport on Wednesday are still OK but we’ll have to get a taxi or something there. “We’ll also have to pay for food and everything until then. It’s ruined the holiday.” Last night the hotel said no one was available for comment. Transport Minister Michael Matheson MSP said: “We are saddened by the collapse of Thomas Cook which has a long history with many jobs in Scotland, the UK and overseas. “We are working closely with the UK Government and the CAA as the situation progresses and the CAA is providing detailed information for customers on their website, via a call centre and through representatives in the resorts and airports. “This will be a very worrying time for employees in Scotland, and Scottish staff based overseas, and we recognise these job losses will have a disproportionate impact on women.

The Duke of York refused to answer questions from The Mirror at the University of South Wales, in Newport, Gwent. It came as pressure intensied on Andrew to help investigations into the deceased billionaire’s sickening crimes. Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood told the Welsh Assembly she was “alarmed” by Andrew’s invite to the business event.    She added: “This member of the royal family has been accused of some very serious crimes and abuses of power. “Many believe his connections with the upper echelons of the British establishment will shade him from the justice system, eventhere is a case to answer.” The Prince denies any wrongdoing. Paris prosecutor Remy Heitz has launched a probe into alleged abuse by Epstein into victims as young as . He believes there is evidence he shipped girls to France as “sex slaves”.    Guests at Epstein’s £.million Paris flat, which reportedly had a massage room, included ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell who allegedly procured victims. Andrew and Maxwell, the daughter of late Mirror owner Robert Maxwell, were friends and travelled regularly together. Maxwell also denies any wrongdoing.

The Duke of Sussex, who has previously spoken of his mental health struggles, told hold how he feels so “overwhelmed” by global issues that he can’t rise in time. Harry, , made the comments during the second day of the his visit to South Africa with we Meghan and baby son Archie. The couple visited the Auwal Mosque in the Bo-Kaap district, the first and oldest mosque in the country, where the Duke spoke to students from the local community.    Among them was Peter Oki, , an Anglican Christian, originally from Lagos, Nigeria, who moved to Cape Town five years ago and attended a Jewish school. Peter, who now studies politics and sociology at the University of Cape Town, said he asked Harry and Meghan what they wanted their “legacy” to be.  “Harry said that he often woke up and felt overwhelmed by too many problems in the world,” said Peter. “That sometimes it’s hard to get out of bed in the mornings because of all the issues. “But he wanted to use their  to enable grass-roots change and to try and create a better society.”    The couple also heard from Banzi Bottoman, , a Christian who attends Gardens Commercial High School. He told them: “Just because someone looks dferent to how I do, that doesn’t make me inferior to anyone . We need to build bridges between people of dferent heritages.” Meghan, who wore a floor- olive dress and cream headscarf, told him: “That was just so meaningful, it gave me chills.” Harry, thumping his chest, said:“You can feel that you’re speaking from here.” Earlier, the couple had been welcomed to the mosque by Imam Sheikh Ismail Londt, the Muslim community leader Mohamed Groenwald and Father Weeder, the Dean of Cape Town. They also met Father Michael Lapsley, an Anglican who was born in New Zealand but moved to South Africa to campaign against segregation during the apartheid era whose hands were blown off in  by a letter bomb.  In April , three months after ANC leader Nelson Mandela’s release from prison, he was sent a letter bomb by the Civil Cooperation Bureau, a covert outfit of the apartheid security forces. It was hidden inside two religious magazines that he was expecting in the mail. The explosion resulted in the loss of both hands and the sight in his left eye, together with seriously burns which kept him in hospital for several months. He said: “Shaking hands is obviously not natural for me so I went to hug the Duchess and her response was “thank you”.  “I received a warm hug from both Harry and Meghan, I could tell immediately they are warm people who mean well. I was only invited the day before the event so I was very honoured to meet them. “Harry immediately motioned to my hands and said ‘letter bomb ’ It was instinctive on his part and it was a good conversation starter. “In terms of Harry and Meghan’s visit, I believe their tone, the way they are speaking has been quite beautul. There’s a naturalness, a warmth, a genuineness that is communicating from them and they have been very well received.” During their visit to the mosque, the couple viewed the first known manuscript of the Qu’ran in South Africa, which was drafted by Imam Tuan Gurufrom memory while he was imprisoned on Robben Island.  Earlier in the day the couple joined schoolchildren at the stunning Monwabisi beach near an infamous crime ridden township where an alleged murderer was shot dead by pilive just hours before the royals’ arrival. There Meghan and Harry meditated with youngsters from the Waves For Change collective which teaches mental health skills and surfing lessons. During a a ‘power hand’ bonding exercise, where the couple were asked to declare their personal strengths, Harry cheekily ducked the task and invited his we to share instead. Meghan looked bashful as she tried to think of something and was told she might consider dancing her strong point, but she laughed and said no.

She is extremely professional, with a number of nannying years under her belt, and has fitted into the family really well. Archieaposs nanny is part of Meghan and Harryaposs -people strong  for the -day trip - including travel coordinators and a social media operative.   She will be looking after the little royal, who is seventh in line to the throne, on occasions when Meghan and Harry attend events together. Archie and the nanny are based at the High Commissioner’s residence in Cape Town for the first part of the trip, and Meghan popped back there this afternoon when Harry went off to a solo event. It is normal for royal parents to take their nanny away with them on royal tour, and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs Norland nanny Maria Borrallo is a regular on overseas trips.    The nanny joined the family when they went to Nice to stay in Elton Johnaposs villa last month. Royal fans are desperately hoping weaposll get to see Archie at some point during the trip, however Meghan and Harry havenapost announced when we will see him. Unlike the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who include child-friendly engagements into their itineraries, the Sussexes donapost have anything for Archie in their trip.However he could make a surprise appearance at some point - with Meghan and Harry saying they will see how they feel .   A palace source said: The Duke and Duchess are very much looking forward to experiencing South Africa as a family but have no concrete plans as to when those opportunities will arise. Archie is only five months old so it’s very much a case of seeing how they are all feeling when they arrive and of course there are the security issues to fully consider when travelling with a small child.

The large female living in the Arctic Ocean took a disliking to a naval boat that appears to have crossed into a path between her and her cubs. According to reports, the walrus attacked a small rubber landing craft carrying a team of scientists from their tugboat and sank the vessel. According to Russiaaposs military news, the team of researchers were on an expedition to the Franz Josef Land archipelago to study its flora and fauna when the walrus attacked.During the landing at Cape Heller, a group of researchers had to flee from a female walrus, which, protecting its cubs, attacked an expedition boat, the Russian Militaryaposs Northern Fleet statement said.   While multiple reports claim the inflatable boat sank, the fleet did not say what became of the vessel in its press release. It said serious trouble at sea was avoided thanks to the fleetaposs servicemen who were able to move the boats away from the mammals without harming them. The military appeared to have been flying a drone above a herd of walruses on a nearby beach to take scientic photographs in recent weeks. Photos posted by the Northern Fleet last week showed massive walrus colonies sighted on the icy archipelago and in surrounding waters.

The patient was in a clinic in South Korea for a routine appointment, but instead awoke still under anaesthetic to find she was no longer pregnant. Authorities say the woman, who was six weeks pregnant, was supposed to be having a nutritional shot at the treatment centre.However a mix-up over her medical charts and failure to check her identity led to her having the termination, reports CNN .   The doctor and nurse in charge have acknowledged their fault and now face an accusation off negligence resulting in bodily harm, a Gangseo Police official told media. The nurse is alleged to have injected the woman with anaesthesia without checking her identity, and the doctor had performed the abortion without checking either. Police reportedly announced the investigation on Monday and will be referring the case to the prosecutoraposs office. This April South Koreaaposs courts overturned a -year ban on abortion. The landmark ruling said the law banning terminations curbed womenaposs rights and was unconstitutional. The countryaposs top court also found the law making doctors liable for criminal chargesthey performed abortions was unconstitutional.    However the reversal of the restrictive laws are not due to take effect until lawmakers revise them, which they must do by the end of December . Under existing laws in the country, abortion remains illegal and is punishable by up to a year in prison. Exceptions are made for cases of pregnancy due to rape or incest, where parents have hereditary diseases, or where the pregnancy is threatening the le of the mother. However  abortion remains under-reported the laws remain largely unenforced, with an estimated , terminations carried out in South Korea last year according to official statistics.

If they hadn’t disallowed so many goals, it surely would be a record. Mind you, - is one almighty score’.“A disconcerted O’Kane feared the worst. Arbroath had really scored  goals.“Tom slept little and, at first light, he was up and out the door.

The two practices are run separately but with many shared resources. We don’t think the time is right to merge the practices completely but we do want a new logo and a name that recognises that we work very closely together.The winning entry will receive a cash prize and will then become the public image of our practices for the foreseeable future.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

Haylodge Park has always been a well-manicured park and this is what makes it such a beautul place to visit and use.He questioned whether the plans had been ldquoproperly thought through given that such meadows require upkeep and maintenance.He added: ldquoThese proposals seek to change the very nature of Haylodge Park which is central to recreational le in Peebles.ldquoThe intention to increase bioersity is a noble one, but where needs to be carefully considered.ldquoThe areas identied are heavily used, particularly along the waterrsquos edge and, in my view, should not change. I recognise that others may have a dferent view and hope thatthey do they let us know what they think.SBC leader Shona Haslamis supportive of the plans, she said: ldquoThe way that we manage our green spaces is a hot topic at the moment but one that requires reflection and a reassessment of how we view these essential parts of our town.ldquoOur knowledge of bioersity has increased hugely in the past few years and we are all very aware of the challenges that we are facing with regards climate change.ldquoWe all have to do our bit to ensure that our wildle has the space that it needs, balanced with ensuring that our public spaces remain popular and useable.ldquoWe are all very used to carefully manicured paths, but actually how wildle-friendly are they  Or are they actually sterile green spaces that, while pretty, are not actually doing anything much good ,params: .pushldquoBy leaving the grass and wildflowers to grow we are creating valuable habitats for our wildle, we are protecting our river banks.ldquoWouldnrsquot it be amazing to see otter families back in that stretch of the river as we have seen in other stretches  It also helps to limit access to the river without the need for unsightly fencing.Councillor Haslam said a mown path would ensure everyone could still enjoy the space and walk along the riverside.ldquoWe cannot continue to do what we have always done and expect a dferent result. We have to look at new ways of improving our public spaces, for the benefit of all, including our wildle.Councillor Stuart Bellsaid he welcomed the introduction of bioersity but warned that the council must be wary of making changes simply to save money.He added: ldquoIrsquove seen the introduction of bioersity areas in other parts of the Borders and these do need on-going and specialist care and attention or they just become an unsightly mess of weeds.I trust that the councilrsquos neighbourhood services team have the skills to manage the changes."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-week","story":"This weeks Pet Of The Week, from Borders Pet Rescue, is a bonded pair of rabbits called Mfy and Boo.The charity told us: \"Mfy is a seven-year-old neutered brown girl and Boo is a two-year-old black and white boy.

have already been expressed by the UK Department for Transport over the benefits of the reintroduction of tracks all the way to Carlisle.Momentum has been growing since funding was announced for a feasibility study earlier this year into taking the Borders Railway through Hawick, Newcastleton and across the English border.But the papers released by the Scottish government in response to a Freedom of Information request reveal that they cant give the go-ahead.And that support from south of the border is not universal.Among the released files and emails is a previously confidential Transport Position Paper from September, .It states: \" It should be noted that Scottish Ministers do not have the powers to construct a cross-border railway line as they only have the powers to construct a railway which starts, ends and remains in Scotland.\"Accordingly, the power to construct a railway line from Tweedbank to Carlisle in its entirety would rest with the UK Government.\"The signing of the Borderlands Inclusive Growth Deal partnership, which is made up of five local authority areas either side of the border, was seen as a major boost for the extension going ahead.The newly released papers show the partnership wrote in June  to Hamza Yousaf, then Scottish Transport Minister, regarding the Borders Railway extension.According to that letter: \"The Settle-Carlisle line shows the benefits of having alternative routes to support the resilience of the rail network.\"The line was threatened with closure in the s but following a successful campaign to keep it open the line was reprieved in .\"Since then the line has played a key role for re-routed main line passenger services when the West Coast or East Coast Main Lines have been closed and for freight services between Scotland Cumbria and the rest of England.\"The Borders Railway between Carlisle and Edinburgh could be equally successful in providing this vital role as an alternative route to the West and East Coast Main Lines for freight and passenger traffic and through this help maximise the growth of the Scottish and UK economy.\"But the enthusiasm and optimism wasnt shared by the UK Department for Transport.Feedback provided by the Department in July  stated: \"We are not convinced an extended Borders Railway would help with capacity issues on the West Coast Main Line.\"Assuming any such extension would have similar characteristics to the existing line i.e. slow and un-electried, it would not be attractive for re-routing any of the existing services using the West Coast Main Line.\"Diesel hauled trains not in a hurry already go via Dumfries so having another ersionary alternative route would not add

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us.

Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule.

And contrary to Mr McDonnellrsquos rhetoric, both job satisfaction and feeling they have the right work le balance is higher among zero-hours workers than employees as a whole.But Mr McDonnell would like to impose costs and government restrictions on private business, to create additional costs and restricted public services for the taxpayer, to prevent iniduals from making their own choices, and to let trades unions dictate terms and conditions of employment.We had something of the sort in the early s, in the days of wage councils, the closed shop, widespread nationalisation, currency crises, state-mandated industrial policy, private sector pay caps and government held to ransom by hugely inflationary wage demands and constant industrial action, which was why we were known as ldquothe sick man of Europe.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn.

As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather.

That cost more than pound,.Mr Livingstone told the Scottish Police Authority in Falkirk yesterday: ldquoThis has been demanding at an operational level but a strategic level as well.ldquoIs it sustainable  No, it is not. The capability of the single service comes in to bear. One of the officers injured was based in Dunfermline. We are drawing officers from right across the country away from their key role to respond to this.ldquoIn terms of sustainability, it is a signicant challenge. In terms of officer safety, there is a growing trend of attacks. There has been a signicant increase in the west of Scotland in particular. They are up by more than a fth.ldquoThe recent manestation of these marches, walks and protests seems to me to be part of a growing trend where our officers are coming under attack and it is utterly unacceptable. It is not part of the job.Referring to the last weekend in August and the first in September, Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said: ldquoThose are officers who are not involved in investigating ndash as we want them to be ndash domestic abuse incidents across the city and tackling drug and traffic offences, and dealing with normal police business.Speaking of the first weekend in September, he said: ldquoSo there are a whole range of opportunity costs which are attendant and added on top of that pound, pure cost of the operation itself.ldquoThat being said, the chief has made it clear that to protect the city of Glasgow and its citizens we will deploy as many police officers as we need to do to make sure the city is both safe and feels safe.ldquoWe have set up an investigation team led by a detective inspector ndashover  detectives are involved in that ndash who are robustly investigating all the offences involved.ldquoWe have made  arrests so far. There will be more arrests over the coming weeks and months.ldquoWe will not accept that sort of behaviour. We certainly wonrsquot accept assaults on our police officers.ldquoOne of those arrests has been for the throwing of the pyrotechnic and one of our officers being injuredby that.Police have also been hurt at football matches, including at Rangers Europa League home game against Feyenoord of the Netherlands. Mr Kerr listed problems: ldquoWe had six officers injured before and during that match.Throwing coins at officers. hitting them in the head and legs. Spitting on officers faces, kicking at their legs, throwing stones, one of which hit an officers in the face, punching officers to the face.ldquoThat is just wholly unacceptable. It cannot be right in  that we have officers deployed to protect their communities subject to that level of violence both at parades and associated protests or at football matches.Mr Kerr urged a sense of perspective. Citing his  years in Belfast policing, he stressed that only a tiny minority were involved in trouble. But he added: ldquoWe do need to have a clear, hard look at ourselves as to whether that is acceptable. We should not be putting officers in that position in the first place."},{"url":null,"title":"papers-digital-journalism-contributing-bottom-line-herald-ever","story":"But that was the position I found myself in on day one when I started as Digital Editor at The Herald in November . Naturally, the filming crew didnrsquot miss a beat, capturing the everyday frustration and the ongoing issues faced by all departments amid a digital transformation.While the transition to a more digital focus for the paper has had its own challenges, as alluded to in the documentary, there have also been a number of positives as part of our digital transformation.There is a perception that the growth of online journalism has resulted in newspapers ldquochasing clicks and impacted the quality of the product, but the reality is that we know exactly what people read and what they want to engage with.:The Papers: Economic reality of trying to compete in new media landscape is under harsh spotlightEvery click on our site is monitored, we can tell what subscribers read, how long they engage for and what stories pick up traction on social media.The simple fact is that we need a ing site that generates income to pay for the high-quality journalism that we strive to produce. Media reflects society and in this digital age, with news consumed quickly, on mobile and through social media, we have tried to change our digital offering to reflect this.Online we continue to publish the same content The Herald is known and loved for, with all print copy going on the website, but we couple it with more analysis on hot topics, breaking stories and pieces that we know our readers want to read.It is this strategy that has seen a signicant growth in The Herald with our unique visitors almost doubling in a year, and . million more articles read online between September  and August .Year on year, The Herald is up byaround  per cent in online readership. Last month more than two million people visited heraldscotland, a record high for the year.The Papers also gives an indication of the challenges faced by the digital desk and the modern-day media overall, with The Herald being one of many papers facing cuts.While there is a perception by some that digital is simply giving content away, the reality is that digital is contributing to the bottom line more than ever before.

As part of our overall focus on digital, we have appointed a Head of Audience who oversees all social media, as well as bringing in a number of multimedia reporters both on news and sport.Training has been rolled out to all of our reporters and rather than creating separate digital teams across dferent titles, we have merged to become one digital desk that drives forward both heraldscotland and eveningtimes, providing consistency and more dedicated staff to the Scottish Newsquest sites than ever before.While improving traffic is key, we have never hidden that The Herald sits behind a paywall and more focus has been emphasised on premium content and building on our growing number of subscribers.We have continued to operate behind our subscription model and have seen a signicant uplt in the number of people subscribing to read The Herald since our new premium model was launched.With more readers supporting our journalism we have also added to the site navigation subsection, improved our video player on site, and carried out an in-depth analysis on our newsletters with changes expected soon.Regardless of the changes we make, no newspaper is without criticism, however, we strive to respond to our readers, and it is that transparency and engagement that we have tried to use to build our brand and trust online.While readers may not necessarily agree with an opinion piece or certain story, we have constantly looked to be open with our readers and to give them a deserved insight. And that was also a motivating factor in the decision to open The Heraldoffice to the BBC cameras in the first place.The filming allowed our readers to see behind the looking glass and an insight into le for staff at The Herald and the everyday problems we faced, but what it also showed was the dedication and passion that staff have for the product both in print and online."},{"url":null,"title":"sainsburys-closing-100-stores-major-business-overhaul","story":"The grocer said it expects to close up to  supermarkets,  convenience stores and  Argos branches.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.buchanobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A body recovered near Boddam is believed to be that of Ruairidh Sandison\"  A body recovered from the coast near Boddam is thought to be that of missing man Ruairidh Sandison. viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BUCH | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

However, the current figure stands at around %. In addition to benefiting the environment, recycling is also much cheaper than landfill.Throughout the week-long campaign, the council is helping residents to recycle more.During the initiative, the local authority’s community waste officers are hosting information sessions at ious locations.They are Tuesday, September  - Banchory Library, am-noon Morrison’s supermarket, Peterhead, am-pm Wednesday, September  - Fly Cup Catering coffee shop, Inverurie, am-pm Thursday, September  - Alford Library, am-pm Friday, September  - Community Coffee Shop at Kemnay Village Hall, .-.am.Residents can drop in and ask questions, learn about all forms of recycling, and find out what happens to their recycling once it has been collected.New stickers are also being placed on the blue-lidded recycling bins throughout September. The labels specy what can be recycled at kerbside and give details of where more information can be found.Crews will aim to cover all recycling bins by the end of the month, but stickers will also be available for residents at household recycling centres .More information about recycling can be found on the council’s website, from checking recycling bin day to an A-Z recycling guide and what happens to the materials afterwards.Councillor Peter Argyle, chair of the infrastructure services committee, said: “Recycle Week is a great opportunity for householders to make a positive contribution to Aberdeenshire’s recycling efforts. “We hope the information provided during the week will encourage residents to make a push towards increased recycling rates.”For a complete guide on the materials that can be recycled in Aberdeenshire, see the A-Z guide at http:bit.ly AshireAZ.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

He said: #We want to thank our residents for doing a great job in increasing the amount of metals they recycle at the kerbside.#However, we want to take that even further now by focusing on foil. I was amazed to learn that an average household can expect to use  foil trays and  metres of foil wrap each year.#The good news is that recycling a tonne of aluminium saves nine tonnes of C emissions and four tonnes of bauxite, the raw material from which aluminium is made. And aluminium can be recycled indefinitely.“So it’s clear that each household converted to foil recycling really does make a dference environmentally. The council also gets a goodfor metals recycling, which helps offset the costs of all our waste disposal activities in Orkney.“But we know from speaking to the public that some people are unaware they can recycle foil in Orkney, or aren’t aware of the benefits. That’s why, with Alupro’s help again, we’ll be highlighting foil recycling during Recycling Week and beyond.”As part of awareness-raising, the council will be installing banners provided by Alupro at recycling centres and other public places around Orkney.OIC’s waste team are also featuring facts and figures about foil recycling on the EcoActive Facebook page, and carrying out visits to schools over Recycling Week.In Orkney, householders can put aluminium foil and foil trays in the metal recycling banks at one of the council’s Household Waste Recycling Centres , or into their recycling bin. The advice is to just rinse off food residue and put in your recycling binalongside other metals you can recycle such as food and drink cans and tins, and metal lids and tops from jars and bottles.For smaller pieces of foilit#s best to make a larger ball of foilby scrunching pieces together # it will prevent smaller pieces falling through machinery during the recycling process.For more information about waste and recycling visit the council#s website or email recycling@orkney.gov.uk .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

So when they retire the feeling of sadness is akin to a death in the family.John Humphrys of the Today programme was the irascible uncle, the kind who at dinner would be very likely to start an argument while grace was being said – but first thing in the morning his rigour and tenacity as he, metaphorically at least, pinned an evasive politician under the wheels of the radio van until the poor sap answered the question would set me up for the challenges of the day.: Jackie Bird reveals she has quit Reporting ScotlandFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereBut we in Scotland are soon to suffer a loss far more grave. When we bid farewell to this bitter and isive year Jackie Bird won’t be around to point the way towards a hopefully better . Stop all the clocks. Stop them around .pm on  December. Cancel Hogmanay!Bird has fronted BBC Scotland’s Auld Year’s Night shindig since back in the auld century. If Humphrys was the grumpy uncle then she was the whoop-it-up aunt in the sparkly dress, capable of embarrassing you in your teens with slobbery festive-season kisses, but who you’d eventually come to appreciate was a good laugh and crucial to every party.Well, the party’s over. Hogmanay Live is to be revamped – it will probably get a name-change – and won’t be hosted by Bird. Unlike Humphrys who has gone willingly and was granted a long goodbye last week and one final opportunity to rough up David Cameron, Bird had rather hoped to stay involved, despite having quit newsreading duties earlier this year. But she was only offered a ten-minute slot leading up to the bells in Edinburgh – “You’ll have had your black bun” as they sometimes say in the capital – and has declined. Now I can’t get out of my head the sad image of Bird trudging the streets on a broken heel, her carryout bag about to burst, as she peers up at tenements looking for a light in a window, flickering to the beat of Prince’s , the year she first presented Hogmanay Live. Oh, and she’s got Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain propping each other up behind her as it doesn’t look like the trusty duo will be part of the new-look show either.Maybe Bird hasn’t been your glass of warm prosecco these past  years. If that’s the case, then it’s typical of the complex relationship Scots have with Hogmanay. It’s summed up for me by memories of my mother looking out the Crabbie’s Green Ginger Wine in anticipation of first-footers on that specially Scottish night of nights – and at the same time my father bolting the door.Everything about Hogmanay is complex, including the black bun. It looks luxurious but after you’ve gorged on it you feel like you’ve swallowed a depth-charge. The idea of a gigantic party sounds great but before too long you’ll be stuck in a corner having zoned out of a conversation with a woman about schools – this is an Edinburgh party – but becoming more and more morose as you reflect on the year ending and the diddly-squat you’ve achieved during it.For a long time Scots liked being viewed as unofficial world champs at Hogmanay, partly because our dear friends in England seemed to struggle with the concept. But when that status became official and Edinburgh started hosting the biggest open-air rave-up on the planet some of us thought: “This isn’t us. This rampant exhibitionism, frolicking in the Firth of Forth and all that, isn’t Scottish. Let’s get back to drinking an estuary’s worth of beer in the privacy of our own parlours then sleeping off the hangover while everything’s shut for two whole days.”Putting Hogmanay on TV is certainly complex. As any film director will tell you, party scenes are tricky to pull off. The nightclub looks half-empty because not enough extras have been hired and when the party is in a house, actors can prove themselves surprisingly bad at dancing, though I suppose the glass heron figurines can be inhibiting. When the programme is live, the date is  December and the entertainment are pished, though, then you’re asking for trouble. There was one notorious show, Live into ’, where comedian Chic Murray “died” and actor John Grieve “corpsed” and a drunken reveller groped singer Maggie Moone mid-song. Actually there were quite a few notorious shows, presenting a portrait of Caledonia that we thought the rest of Britain and, by extension the world, wanted to see. BBC Scotland producer Iain MacFadyen was the master of these hoary heather ’n’ haggis-stuffed heuch-athons, earning him the nickname of the Ayatollah Hogmanay.To minimise risk Grampian used to drape country houses in tinsel and pre-record their New Year celebrations in August. But, you know, I reckon Bird could have coped with one of those Hogmanays from hell. I can see her smiling sweetly while Tennent’s Lager Lovelies cavort with men dressed as Lee’s macaroon bars and a flying caber knocks out the foremost authority on William McGonagall just as Simple Minds roar into a medley of their hits.Unfortunately I’m not going to see this. I’m not going to see Bird again on Auld Year’s Night and that’s a great pity. In a dignied farewell, she says she knows what’s in the re-styled show but won’t comment on it, simply wishing Beeb Scotland well with their new endeavour. Should the rest of us be worried  Perhaps. Much as I would like to be more like my mum, I fear I’m turning into my dad. Thus, not only will the door be bolted, I might have to switch off the TV as well.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"leader comment there is no travel insurance for the thomas cook employees","story":"Within hours of the Thomas Cook collapse, accusations were surfacing about rival holiday firms cashing in by hiking their prices. Meanwhile, the UK’s largest peacetime repatriation swung into action as the Civil Aviation Authority worked out how to bring , stranded tourists back home. Families turned up at airports not knowingthey were going to get to go on holidays, other stories surfaced about honeymoons and weddings thrown into chaos. It is, however you look at it, an appalling situation, and our sympathies are with everyone affected. Amid all the rolling coverage yesterday, however, one element appeared all but overlooked. The fact that , people, , of whom are in the UK have not lost their holidays with Thomas Cook’s failure but their livelihoods. While the £ million Operation Matterhorn is bringing tourists home, another looming challenge for the governments in both London and Edinburgh will be the thousands now out of work. The arguments over whether the UK Government was right to refuse a bail-out to the stricken travel giant will continue. There are questions around what it knew when and whether it could have stepped in sooner to prevent catastrophe. There is further anger over the lack of scrutiny of its actions caused by the proroguing of parliament. But none of that changes the simple fact that a -year-old business, a mainstay of the British high street for so long, has disappeared forever.

It is reassuring to see the Scottish Government has already made an offer of support through its Partnership Action for Continuing Employmentinitiative, and the support available on a UK-wide scale should be far greater.The thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos can retain some comfort that their holidays were protected by law and they will be refunded, albeit they may face a long wait.

Well done to all those who bothered to go out to make their feelings known, rather than sitting at home making supercilious comments online.Surely all Shetlanders are either incomers or the descendants of incomers John Ridland presumably wants to see some form of Apartheid with multigenerational residents receiving greater recognition and status.This rednecked social exclusionary nonsense just gets so tired. It might helpit can be appreciated that there are dferent types of Shetlanders, with all Shetlanders being equally valid.Maybe Shetlander is a state of mind, of wanting to care for, share in and build the community for the greater good, doing weel for the common weel and persevering.I sincerely hope John Ridland’s atypical attitude will one day be consigned to the dustbin of history.It should be challenged wherever it raises its ugly head.So far as he knows John did nothing worthy in a past le to be born in Shetland.He could equally have been born where.It’s the lottery of birth that entitles him to don that mantle and there is no need for him to be making others who also care for where they live feel unwelcome.Can he not see this inward and backwards looking approach is harming his community, not strengthening or celebrating it Shameful. #xenophobiasucks#getoveritYes Peter totally agree.Becauseyou went to live with the Pigmy people of equitorial Africa for several months you would be just as big a Pigmy as they are.That is because they #are just incomers or the descendants of incomers#.There is obviously no dference.The IPCC calls for collective international action and condemns unilateral actions e.g. #declaration of climate emergency#, as ineffective.

Shetland folk music would never have developedthose playing it only ever stuck to listening to and playing the original tunes.Let’s remember the accordions came in fae sooth. If, in times past, the small-hearted and narrow-minded had called the tune, well there certainly would not have been so much Shetland culture to celebrate.Shetland culture has always developed in relation to other influences.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

Gareth Bronte on This MorningIt was to be the first time the family had met Gareth and his we Kirsty in the flesh.It made for an emotional segment on the show as presenters Phil Scholfield and Holly Willoughby introduced the story which was captioned ‘A Random ‘Slice’ Of Birthday Kindness’. Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  . The Kolbe South Africa double is also available at  , while those looking a patriotic punt could do worse than back Iain Hendersonto score the first try for Ireland in Sunday’s opening game against Scotland with the Ulster ace available at  ."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38047661.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/patch.jpg","title":"get ready for the transfer tests with the belfast telegraph and transfertests co uk","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Find out when the exams are and get the advice that the schools give out, but don’t waste your energy following rumours about what the grade is. It’s better to spend your time helping your child.It’s always worth practising. Whatever schools say, it’s worth it. Children can improve their performance by  -% by careful practice.Start earlyyou can, but don’t worryyou haven’t. Ideally it is best to start preparation for the Transfer Test exam at least one year ahead. However, don’t panicyou don’t have that much time even a few weeks can make a dference.Make a simple action plan. However long you’ve got, have a clear, simple strategy. There are two key principles: . Start from your child’s present level of knowledge. . Help your child to learn from their mistakes.Motivation, motivation, motivation! You have to take your child with you on this journey. A simple rewards system can be highly effective.Don’t just practice. There’s a tendency to think that just practising one test after anther will do the trick. It’s far more important to learn from mistakes. Going through the test afterwards with your child and filling in the the gaps in learning is crucial.Stay calm, manage stress, build confidence. Don’t talk about the Transfer test all the time. Use breaks, treats and bite-sized learning sessions to keep things fresh. Be realistic about your child’s potential. Pass or fail, it’s important to try to make this process a positive one.Manage the exam day. Make sure that you have everything ready for the day, that your child tries to get a good night’s sleep, eats breakfast and gets there in good time.How and when to use our testsIt’s best to use them as real exam practice. These tests are mock exams. They are set out in a style as close as possible to the real thing – though the format will y from year to year. It is best to use them as authentic exam experience rather than for general practice. Follow the instructions and advice in the sections before starting the test.What a score means and how to boost itIt is unfortunately impossible to say that a certain score can guarantee a pass in the actual exams. However, we suggest that a score of % would be a standard to aim at. It is important not to present this to your child as a concrete benchmark though, as the best motivator for them is to see the scores going up. Here are some tried and tested tips for improvement.Go over any incorrect answers. Always go over incorrect answers so that your child can see what went wrong. To help with this process, some of our harder Maths questions are explained.Use an action planner inside. This will provide a plan for what to do next when a test has been marked.Improve basic exam technique. Work on improving speed, working efficiently – coming back to trickier questions later – and pacing within the time limit.Improve general English skills. Ensure the foundations are strong enough. Use a range of checklists to help reinforce your child’s English skills.Target what is not fully understood. The secret is not to keep blindly practising but to target the areas of English Maths that your child is weakest in. This is where crucial marks can be picked up.Once your child has completed the papers you can download the corresponding answer sheets here:Answer sheets: Monday rd SeptemberAnswer sheets: Tuesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Wednesday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Thursday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Friday th SeptemberAnswer sheets: Saturday th SeptemberIf you would like to access the answer sheets for the transfer test practice papers from April May , you can access them here.Answer sheets: Monday th AprilAnswer sheets: Tuesday th AprilAnswer sheets: Wednesday st MayAnswer sheets: Thursday nd MayAnswer sheets: Friday rd MayAnswer sheets: Saturday th May"},{"url":null,"title":"20k for woman sacked by northern ireland firm for","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I was very worried that the stress could cause complications or even a miscarriage.\"We were in a very bad situation for a time and it is a great relief to me to have this all finished.\"Ms Gruzdaites case was supported by the Equality Commission. She added: \"I am very grateful to the Equality Commission for helping me.\"No woman should lose her job because she is pregnant and it is important that women challenge such treatment.\"Ms Gruzdaite and her husband Andrius Jasinevicius started work at McGrane Nurseries Ltd, a wholesale suppliers of plants, in January , and were given a blank contract to sign with no start or end dates.She believed she was coming to Northern Ireland for a permanent job but at no point was she told it was to be a seasonal job.When she announced her pregnancy and showed the appointment letter for her first antenatal appointment to one of her managers on September , , he forgot to tell the other manager about it.Ms Gruzdaite was called to a meeting on September  with both managers to explain why she had not been at work.She also told a manager on October  about a later scan appointment on October , and she was called in to a meeting about her absence on October .The tribunal found that she was unjustiably questioned about her absence on September  and October  when she had told her manager that she was off for antenatal appointments.The employer accepted that they failed to pay Ms Gruzdaite for her time off attending the antenatal appointments.The tribunal found that a manager was less friendly to Ms Gruzdaite after she announced her pregnancy.On October , while she and her husband were at that antenatal appointment, their employers held a meeting at which a group of seasonal workers were given one weeks notice of termination.The couple were subsequently called in to meet with their employers on October  and were informed of their dismissal.Other seasonal workers were kept on by the employer and carried out the duties previously performed by Laura.On that day, her manager said to her: \"You will need more days off for your pregnancy doctors appointment... you already skipped work on Wednesday when you had your ultrasound scan.\"At tribunal, Ms Gruzdaite said: \"On that day I got very upset because both of our contracts had been terminated.\"We were waiting for our child to come into this world but both of us were unemployed and had no additional income.\"When I ed to my place of work following this conversation, I felt nauseous, my hands were shaking, and I felt a dull pain and a stretching sensation in my stomach.\"The tribunal concluded the decision to terminate Ms Gruzdaites contract was tainted by discrimination in that it was connected to her pregnancy.Her dismissal was both unfair and an act of unlawful discrimination, it ruled.Dr Michael Wardlow, the chief commissioner of the Equality Commission, said around a quarter of all the complaints of discrimination made to its advice line each year are to do with sex discrimination.Of those, consistently the largest number, around % of the total, are about pregnancy and maternity discrimination.Mr Wardlow said: \"It is dispiriting that we are at tribunal once again supporting another case of pregnancy discrimination.\"Im afraid this is still all too common and, in spite of the legislation being in place for more than  years, some employers still seem to be unaware of the law and the consequences of breaching it.\"Laura Gruzdaite was  weeks pregnant at the time she and her husband were dismissed.\"They had arrived in Northern Ireland ready and willing to work and have started to make their le here.\"Lauras husband has since found other work and she is caring for their baby.\"A spokesperson for McGrane Nurseries said: \"We acknowledge the findings of the Equality Commission.\"We have engaged the services of a professional HR company who are assisting us in implementing a series of policies and practices to ensure we meet the highest standards in relation to the issues highlighted in the judgment of this case.\"This situation should never have occurred. We apologise to Laura for the upset caused to both her and her family and hope that this ruling will allow them to move forward.\""},{"url":null,"title":"all northern ireland paper 5 and 10 banknotes to be withdrawn from circulation","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year. His report, published on  January , raises challenging, long-term, strategic and cross-cutting questions with major financial implications.Amongst other issues, it recommends expanding medical training places by at least  per year, potentially costing up to an additional £m per year when fully implemented. This report is a key consideration of UU in putting forward its proposal for a medical school in Derry.While DoH has been assisting UU in the development of its Outline Business Casefor a Graduate Entry Medical School at Magee Campus, this is separate from any decision on medical student expansion in Northern Ireland. Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry public invited quiz karaoke holywell trust support honesty cafe","story":"The Derry public have been invited to a quiz and karaoke night in support of the Holywell Trusts Honesty Cafe this Friday night, September .The cafe, which is the first initiative of its kind in Derry,  allows people to pay what they can.  It has been warmly welcomed by locals for its inclusive ethos and has been running successfully for three months.It is based in the Holywell building on Bishop Street but people can also enjoy their lunch in the Garden of Reflection.There is no till but instead three honesty boxes so people can pay whatever they decide its worth or contribute what they can afford.  If they have no cash they can donate online on our website.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshWith many people in poverty who have to make use of food banks it is a positive scheme which relies on public generosity and kind-heartedness - something Derry people are known to possess in abundance.Customers are able pay it forward so that someone in greater need can eat for less or for freeneeds be.Antoin OHara who frequents the cafe has organised the fundraising event and would urge people to come along and donate what they can.The event begins at pm and people can bring their own refreshments."},{"url":null,"title":"door now wide open independent nw university derry university group","story":"A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has responded to the report on higher education published by Julian Smith.We welcome the clarity provided by this report and intend to respond in full in due course.At the outset, we wish to thank Lord Andrew Adonis, the Shadow Employment Minister Mike Amesbury MP and the Shadow Schools Minister Mike Kane MP for championing this issue at Westminster, and also the authors of this report.The Shadow Education Minister Angela Rayner has also raised the prospect of Derry availing of Transformation Fundingand we thank her for that proposal.On initial reading, this report provides a roadmap as to how the North West can develop its own autonomous university.

Last year she protested for more than a month prior to Swedens parliamentary elections by sitting alone on the steps of the parliament building in Stockholm.Following the elections she spent Fridays there demanding the government undertake a radical response to climate change.She has since inspired a mass movement supported by people, young and old, around the world.On Saturday Derry people continued to champion her cause by carrying placards reading, The Sea is Rising and so are We and We Need to Change the Politics not the Climate.Linda O Sullivan of Friends of the Earth told an audience gathered in the Guildhall that we are facing an \"existential crisis\" and people \"need to be held accountable\".And Paddy Nash, musician and environmentalist, sang a song inspired by the Save Our Sperrins campaign against gold mining.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening.

I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development

Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued

In the fth minute a free was given away by the lsquoFin defence and Cormac Venney slotted over from the m line.In the sixth minute a superb full-pitch move from the lsquoFin was finished by Breannain McComiskey, restoring the two-point lead.A minute later Garland was clinical when he drove to the net to put the lsquoFin firmly in the driving seat. Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game. Excellent game management from the lsquoFin as they saw out a first ever championship win over their derby rivals.Impressive performances from Garland and Flanagan in attack while in defence the full back line of Brannigan, Dillon and Willoughby was superb with McComiskey putting in a big sht on the .Dundrum were best served by Eamon King in goal, Hurley, McShane in defence and their key forward Glavin.Dundrum: E King, R Carey, R McGuigan, C Miskelly, T McShane, J Hurley, A Doyle, N Rogers, Odhran McKibbin, P Curry, A Fegan , K Glavin , Oisisn McKibbin, C Venney , C Mulholland.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July . Before then they had already spent four years attempting to trace owners.This week councillors decided to end their six-year search and apply for vesting mdash a statutory power which enables a Government department to buy land compulsorily, despite the wishes of the owner.But they were warned by council administrative officer, Mr Owen OrsquoConnor, that it would be a dficult vesting order and he could not guarantee that the whole of the inner bay of Killough would be acquired before December.The last-ditch attempt to beat the deadline was sparked off by Downpatrick councillor, Mr John Ritchie, who has been trying to push the council into buying the harbour since .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Our little boy Caleb, who is four, came up with the idea of letting a helium balloon go so that it would make its way up to heaven. That was something we had planned.“I’d said to Kirsty I wanted to do something dferent, maybe a little random act of kindness to share a little joy.

So, do I belong to the IRA  I did not, never have, am not, and have no intention.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button However, based on his own words in a BBC Spotlight film to be broadcast tonight, those denials were lies.Ryan, who is almost , was the critical link between Libya and the IRA as Colonel Muammar Gaddafi happily supplied guns and explosives to republicans so that they could attack their common enemy, the British.Speaking in the third instalment of Spotlight’s seven-part series on the Troubles, Ryan is explicit about his own role in illegal activities.Spotlight did not state whether Ryan still lives in Ireland nor did it explain why he has now decided to self-incriminate himself as has done.During the interview with the BBC, Ryan praised the Libyan dictator who was killed in an uprising in . He said: “He was a fine fella. One of the best I ever met. We got on very well.”Ryan had been a Catholic missionary in east Africa but was back in Ireland working as a parish priest when the Troubles began at the end of the s.He said that he financially contributed “as much help as I could – some of it out of the mission boxes – to the situation up north” and then was “approached by some of the IRA leaders down here [to ask]perchance I could work for them permanently. They asked me to travel the world and try to get help for them.”Ryan eventually fell out with the church and left the Pallottine order in .That year he was instrumental in securing a five-tonne shipment of weaponry from Tripoli but it was intercepted before arriving in Ireland. He said that the original plan had been for a -tonne shipment but that at the last minute the load had been slashed by the Libyan authorities for reasons which were never explained to him.No Deal Brexit: As many , people in Republic of Ireland with U.K. driving licence could be driving illegally Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"It was Ryan who realised that a gadget used in continental Europe to remind drivers toto their cars before their parking tickets ran out could be used as timers in bombs.Hundreds of the Memopark timers were bought by the former priest on the continent and sent to the UK or Ireland for IRA use.The fragments of a Memopark timer was recovered from the rubble of the Brighton Hotel bombing which almost killed Margaret Thatcher in  and did kill five others, as well as injuring more than , some very seriously.In a declassied government document, Margaret Thatcher was shown to have described Ryan as “a very dangerous man” who had “an expert knowledge of bombing” and had been the key conduit between the IRA and Libya for over a decade.When Mrs Thatcher’s accusations were put to him and he was askedhe was involved in any of those incidents, he said: “I would say most of them one way or another, I had a hand in most of them. Yes, she was right.”Askedshe was right to link him to bombs such as Hyde Park and Brighton, he said: “Absolutely – %. Oh yes.”When askedhe had any regrets, he said: “Oh, I have, yes. Big regrets. Of what nature  I regret that I wasn’t even more effective. Oh yes absolutely. I’d like to have been even more effective than I actually was. But we didn’t do too badly, no.”l Spotlight on The Troubles: A Secret History will be broadcast tonight on BBC One Northern Ireland and also simultaneously on BBC Four at pm.try catch  TrendingN.I.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a long waiting list.ldquoWe have to make sure these are properties we have finance for and they are up to our standards as well. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/catherine_1.jpg","title":"word from the wise kathryn collie","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business How did you start out in your business  I followed the fairly well trodden path of completing my legal practice course at the University of Law in Guildford, having graduated with a degree in law from university in England. Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London.
