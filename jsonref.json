Nevertheless, a bit of rapture or ecstasy wouldn’t go amiss for any of us.Even if it isn’t quite the physical thing, there is always art. Armchair tours of the world’s museums, now that we can’t go anywhere, will have to do. The experience is in some ways far from second best. Have you ever tried muscling your way through the crowds gathered in front of Rembrandt’s Night Watch in Amsterdam’s Rijkmuseum? Mostly, they are letting their smart phones do the watching.You can home right in or back away, without bumping into anyone. If you want to get closer still, the Night Watch is being restored, and you can watch (there is even an accompanying children’s tour). The Rijkmuseum, along with more than a thousand other museums worldwide, is now partnering with Google Arts \u0026amp Culture, where you can get inside everywhere from MoMA in New York to the Munch Museum in Oslo, from the British Museum to the Musée d’Orsay in Paris to the Today Art Museum in Beijing. Not only that, the website also allows you to zoom in far closer on inidual works than you ever could in real life. Like a dragonfly, you can alight on Monet’s pond, lose yourself in the sky beyond the branches in a Cézanne landscape, or get personal with the ruffs and jerkins, the bulbous noses and elephant eyes of the Night Watch.Fancy a trip to the Prado and its 936 Goyas, some of which come with extensive commentaries and videos (with English subtitles). The same approach is applied to Velázquez, Bosch, Rogier van der Weyden and the other artists in what is my favourite museum, and you can spend days on the Prado website, just as you can in the museum, and fall down the rabbit hole of its interactive timeline.

Based at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, in Humlebaek, Denmark, its website is full of good, sometimes alarming, things. As well as poets, novelists, architects ad thinkers, artists discussing single works, artists talking about outer space and the Arctic, artists who use water in their work, writers on facing the blank page and a section devoted to advice to the young. Whether you want to watch David Hockney talking about space, Marina Abramović discussing Giacometti, painters winding each other up or just terrific conversations, this is a very good place to find yourself.While you are at the Louisiana Channel you can also find conceptual poet Kenneth Goldsmith performing verbatim traffic reports to President Obama at a White House poetry reading. Goldsmith is founding editor of Ubu, a cornucopia of sometimes arcane and historical delights. I have been dipping in and out of this essential resource for years, with its old radio conversations and interviews, the punk rock of Martin Kippenberger and pop songs by Joseph Beuys, readings by John Ashbery and Roni Horn, a huge reservoir artists’ films and videos, from Bruce Nauman to Agnés Varda, John Akomfrah to Martha Rosler. I have barely scratched the surface.For more instant delights, the Instagram feeds of Alice Rawsthorn and Stephen Ellcock are worth a follow. Rawsthorn writes about design (what she really focuses on is the material pleasures and strangeness of the world, design is just a way in) while Ellcock, who is described as “an image hunter and social media art curator”, posts the most astonishing images.

There are only so many podcasts released each week, and streaming TV shows and films for 18 hours straight is no more practical than reading books all day, if one has to be moving around cooking, exercising, or preventing small children from maiming themselves with unexpected household objects. So perhaps the long-form audiobook deserves a top slot in the menu of, I’m sorry, quarantainment.This might be a good chance to catch up on classics from previous centuries. An unavoidable monument here – and already a recent bestseller on Scribd, which has just announced that all its books and audiobooks will be available free for 30 days — is The Plague by Albert Camus. This is the tale of a small French-Algerian town cut off from the outside world after an outbreak of bubonic plague, which its citizens at first refuse to believe is a serious threat. The central character, a doctor, remarks that his fellow townspeople in this respect “were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves in other words, they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences. A pestilence isn’t a thing made to man’s measure therefore we tell ourselves that pestilence is a mere bogy of the mind, a bad dream that will pass away.”Long celebrated as a masterful allegory of Nazi occupation, The Plague is also a story of qualified hope, as a kind of existential solidarity persists while the storm rages outside. Some British listeners might, however, find themselves irritated by the American-accented narration in the only audiobook edition, which has a certain amount of trouble with the French names, and opt instead for Daniel Defoe’s grisly yet also undespairing A Journal of the Plague Year (1722), as narrated in the reassuringly Beebish tones of Andrew Cullum.A more purely escapist experience might be the great epic of comfortable society in France. If there is an ultra-endurance champion among audiobook readers, it must be the late actor Neville Jason, who recorded every single word (there are more than a million) of Proust’s great novel sequence, In Search of Lost Time (or, in the Scott Moncrieff translation used for the audiobook, originally Remembrance of Things Past). It runs to 150 hours, or a bit less than a couple of hours every day for 12 weeks. At one point in the third volume, Proust’s narrator remarks: “It is illness that makes us recognise that we do not live in isolation but are chained to a being from a different realm, worlds apart from us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body.”The vagaries of this being from a different realm are the subject of Bill Bryson’s most recent book, narrated with his usual charm by the author himself. The Body is ideal for the audio format, being a warm and engaging tour through the amazing facts of human physiology, with plenty of “did you know?” moments to keep the household entertained. Did you know, for example, that scientists have determined that scratching your back gives the most long-lasting relief, but scratching your ankle brings the most pleasure?The more you learn about your body, the more of a miracle it seems, if you’re lucky enough to have one that is still more or less in working order, even if no pandemic is raging. At one point Bryson, who throughout assumes a rather portly audience, exhorts you to “get up and move around a little”. This is rather difficult if one is reading, and wants to continue reading, the print version, but it’s fine advice for the shut-in listener.More purely escapist comfort listening is the classic BBC dramatisation of all of John le Carré’s classic George Smiley books: nowadays the cold war represents a simpler, even cosier time in the popular imagination, and Smiley himself, an owlish wanderer through the world’s shades of grey, represents in some ways the kind of prime minister we are not allowed to have any more. He is played in this “full-cast audiobook” (jargon for, essentially, a repackaged radio drama) by the great Simon Russell Beale.And if that still proves a little too this-worldly, there are more fantastical options. Those who like their medieval fantasy nonsense with a side order of sarcastic wit and catchy songs will have been bereft once they’d finished bingeing on the first season of The Witcher, starring as the grey-ponytailed monster hunter. A ersion for the ears while fans wait for the second TV series are the audiobooks of the original novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. They begin with the gloriously titled Blood of Elves, which may recall the deathless comment of literary scholar Hugo Dyson, who was one of the “Inklings” to whom Tolkien used to read instalments of Lord of the Rings. On one such occasion, Dyson is said to have groaned: “Oh fuck, not another elf.”A serene attitude towards the undesired appearance of elves, as well as towards much else, was cultivated by the great Stoics of classical times, among them the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. His Meditations, read in suitably imperial manner by Duncan Steen, are more authentically inspiring than any modern “inspirational” memes – and often quite funny. “The object of life is not to be on the side of the majority,” he wrote, “but to avoid finding oneself among the ranks of the insane.” And remember: “The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall.”If, as a kind of exercise in meditating upon how things could be even worse, you wish to catch up on the latest expert thinking about alternative apocalypses, there is Stuart Russell’s excellent Human Compatible: AI and the Problem of Control, read by Raphael Corkhill. Russell, a pioneer in machine intelligence, here considers the increasingly fashionable subject of what to do if a superintelligent AI is created and then takes over the world – or rather, how to stop that from happening.He provides a vivid and clear history of computing, and explains the problems inherent in trying to “load” values into AI so as to prevent it from trying to destroy us. He concludes that trying to give it any values at all is a mug’s game. Instead, the AI should be taught a humble attention to humans’ wishes. Particularly apt at the moment, when Facebook is “accidentally” censoring reliable news while blithely enabling the transmission of misinformation, is Russell’s argument that we all have an inalienable right “to live in a largely true information environment”, the draconian enforcement of which cannot come soon enough.A celebrity reader, meanwhile, is often a powerful draw for an audiobook. Margaret Atwood’s dystopian The Handmaid’s Tale is available in editions read by Claire Danes or Elisabeth Moss, star of the TV series, while none other than Meryl Streep has recorded Nora Ephron’s Heartburn. And in case you have never got through, or started, Homer’s Odyssey, perhaps the existence of an audiobook of the Robert Fagles translation, read by Ian McKellen, will finally render the prospect irresistible.Most authors are not the ideal readers of their own work – and why should they be? Writing prose and being able to read aloud in such a way as to hold a listener’s attention are two entirely different skills that happen to coexist in one person only by pure coincidence. One delightful such coincidence is novelist Anne Enright, whose performance of her own widely admired new novel, Actress, brings out all the mischievous empathy of her writing. Perhaps it is something to do with being Irish, because Marian Keyes also reads her new book, Grown Ups, with a nicely understated wit.In a way, David Cameron is also the ideal reader of his own work, if only because you would feel sorry for anyone else who had to do it. For some light comic relief, it is possible to listen to the architect of Britain’s last disaster before the present one reading his own memoir, imaginatively entitled For the Record, as though carefully holding a quail’s egg in his mouth while insisting that the Brexit referendum he didn’t have to call was “necessary” and “inevitable”. From the somewhat rustic ambience of the recording, one may happily imagine him narrating it from his expensive wheeled shed in the Cotswolds, the kind of civilised retreat to which we might all wish we now had access.• Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus.

The Greater Depression beckonsIn other words, every component of aggregate demand – consumption, capital spending, exports – is in unprecedented freefall. While most self-serving commentators have been anticipating a V-shaped downturn – with output falling sharply for one quarter and then rapidly recovering the next – it should now be clear that the Covid-19 crisis is something else entirely. The contraction that is now under way looks to be neither V- nor U- nor L-shaped (a sharp downturn followed by stagnation). Rather, it looks like an I: a vertical line representing financial markets and the real economy plummeting.Not even during the Great Depression and the second world war did the bulk of economic activity literally shut down, as it has in China, the US and Europe today. The best-case scenario would be a downturn that is more severe than the financial crisis (in terms of reduced cumulative global output) but shorter-lived, allowing for a return to positive growth by the fourth quarter of this year. In that case, markets would start to recover when the light at the end of the tunnel appears.But the best-case scenario assumes several conditions. First, the US, Europe and other heavily affected economies would need to roll out widespread Covid-19 testing, tracing, and treatment measures, enforced quarantines, and a full-scale lockdown of the type that China has implemented. And, because it could take 18 months for a vaccine to be developed and produced at scale, antivirals and other therapeutics will need to be deployed on a massive scale.Second, monetary policymakers – who have already done in less than a month what took them three years to do after the financial crisis – must continue to throw the kitchen sink of unconventional measures at the crisis. That means zero or negative interest rates enhanced forward guidance quantitative easing and credit easing (the purchase of private assets) to backstop banks, non-banks, money market funds, and even large corporations (commercial paper and corporate bond facilities). The US Federal Reserve has expanded its cross-border swap lines to address the massive dollar liquidity shortage in global markets but we now need more facilities to encourage banks to lend to illiquid but still-solvent small and medium-size enterprises.But these deficit-financed interventions must be fully monetised. If they are financed through standard government debt, interest rates would rise sharply, and the recovery would be smothered in its cradle. Given the circumstances, interventions long proposed by leftists of the Modern Monetary Theory school, including helicopter drops, have become mainstream.Unfortunately for the best-case scenario, the public-health response in advanced economies has fallen far short of what is needed to contain the pandemic and the fiscal-policy package currently being debated is neither large nor rapid enough to create the conditions for a timely recovery. As such, the risk of a new Great Depression, worse than the original – a Greater Depression – is rising by the day.Unless the pandemic is stopped, economies and markets around the world will continue their freefall. But even if the pandemic is more or less contained, overall growth still may not return by the end of 2020. After all, by then, another virus season is very likely to start with new mutations therapeutic interventions that many are counting on may turn out to be less effective than hoped. So, economies will contract again and markets will crash again.Moreover, the fiscal response could hit a wall if the monetisation of massive deficits starts to produce high inflation, especially if a series of virus-related negative supply shocks reduces potential growth. And many countries simply cannot undertake such borrowing in their own currency. Who will bail out governments, corporations, banks, and households in emerging markets?In any case, even if the pandemic and the economic fallout were brought under control, the global economy could still be subject to a number of “white swan” tail risks. With the US presidential election approaching, the Covid-19 crisis will give way to renewed conflicts between the west and at least four revisionist powers: China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea, all of which are already using asymmetric cyberwarfare to undermine the US from within. The inevitable cyber attacks on the US election process may lead to a contested final result, with charges of “rigging” and the possibility of outright violence and civil disorder.• Nouriel Roubini is a professor at NYU’s Stern School of Business and was senior economist for international affairs in the Clinton White House’s Council of Economic Advisers.

Such a sharp slump is confirmation that Germany is heading for a steep recession.“This is the steepest fall ever recorded since German reunification and the lowest value since July 2009.The German economy is in shock.Of course, we did know that already....The pound is also rallying this morning, up 1.5 cents against the US dollar at $1.19 - its highest level this week.It’s also up nearly one eurocent at €1.099.The dollar and the euro have been treated as safe-haven assets in recent weeks. So sterling’s recovery indicates that the markets are becoming less anxious about the future.Mark Haefele, CIO at UBS Global Wealth Management, says the mood is brightening, thanks to the recent measures taken by central bankers and governments.We think the actions of monetary and fiscal policymakers should help us prevent a Global Financial Crisis (GFC) style credit crunch. Tuesday’s sharp equity rally shows that the combination of central banks’ entire GFC playbook and substantial, direct fiscal support can be well received by markets.”That’s quite a recovery from Monday, when the FTSE 250 fell below 12,770. But it was trading over 21,000 points in mid-February...With shares up sharply this week, some investors will be wondering if they should ‘buy the dip’ before it’s too late. Well, we certainly don’t do investment advice here! But Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal \u0026amp General Investment Management, has to make such calls... and he advises caution.Van den Heiligenberg writes that he’s “wary on the outlook for risk assets like global equities”.This due to uncertainty over the economic impact of COVID-19 and how effective policymakers will be in cushioning the damage.I hope that everyone’s families, friends and businesses are weathering these difficult times well. Health is such a precious thing and it is all too easy for us to take it for granted, so in that respect the coronavirus is a jolt for us all as iniduals as well as for global economies and markets.As central bankers and governments unveil increasingly powerful measures to mitigate the economic and financial impact of the coronavirus outbreak, many investors are asking: is now the time to buy the dip in equities?We believe the answer is “no” – for now – and are increasing our cautious tactical stance on stocks.Eventually there will be “fantastic buying opportunities”, he adds, but probably not yet...They’ve both suffered badly from the Covid-crisis given their respective exposure to the Chinese luxury market and the UK domestic economy.Boom! The UK stock market has jumped at the start of trading, as investors cheer the overnight breakthrough over America’s $2trn stimulus package.Karen Ward, chief market strategist at JP Morgan, says such fiscal stimulus packages are a crucial step forwards..... but probably won’t prevent a jump in US unemployment: “The Senate’s approval of the $2trn package should provide a positive lift to investors’ moods in the near term, complementing the U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive action in the past four weeks. This is particularly important given the aggressive fiscal stimulus from European and Asian governments in the past two weeks. The US government needs to be seen as not just counting on the Fed to do all the heavy lifting, especially when cutting rates and providing liquidity alone are not sufficient to help businesses and households to get through such tough times. “The key question is whether these policies will be enough to facilitate a rebound once the virus is contained and shutdowns are removed. To answer this question we are following the employment data closely. If government policies prevent people from losing their jobs then a bounce back looks feasible. We are more confident that the stimulus policies put in place in Europe will adequately support employment. We suspect - and believe the jobless claims data out tomorrow will testify - that US unemployment is already on the rise which will prolong the period of weakness.”Recruitment firm Staffline reports that the UK jobs market has been changed dramatically, if maybe only temporarily, by Covid-19.It told the City this morning....There is a marked increase in demand in the food sector, including food processing, logistics and supermarkets....Conversely, demand from other sectors such as retail, automotive and manufacturing has diminished considerably with the Group’s limited exposure to white collar and permanent recruitment also impacted. Pest control firm Rentokil has warned the City that the coronavirus is having a much deeper impact on its firm than previously thought.It says that “in the last 10 days the outbreak has escalated rapidly impacting businesses around the globe in an unprecedented manner”. This has forced Rentokil to withdraw its previous profit guidance for 2020, as the company cannot predict the impact of Covid-19 on its business. The firm is also suspending idends, cutting board pay, cancelling executive bonuses, reining in its M\u0026ampS activity, freezing hiring and scaling back its marketing. This is quite a change of tact -- last month, Rentokil thought the outbreak would only have limited impact on its operations, partly thanks to “strong” demand for its hand hygiene services. Now, though, many of its customers are shut down!It told the City that it now faces “a difficult second quarter”, and maybe beyond:Some customer sectors have been substantially closed due to government and voluntary actions taken to limit the impact of the virus. This includes the HORECA sector (Hotels, Restaurants and Catering), the airline industry, schools and some offices.Conversely demand for our services in areas such as food production, food retailing and healthcare have been strong with increased demand.Another flurry of UK companies are updating shareholders about the impact of Covid-19 on their business.Persimmon, the house-builder, says its sales offices will close tomorrow “until further notice”, with its construction sites now in an “orderly shutdown” (responding to UK rules on physical distancing) Like many other companies, Persimmon is now trying to hoard capital rather than hand it to investors. So, it is cancelling its interim idend payment that was due next week, and postponing its annual idend due in July.European markets are on track to build on yesterday’s strong gains:Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, cautions against too much exuberance: It is worth noting that we still have very little visibility on what may happen in the weeks and months to come. With an almost certain worldwide recession looming, the virus-infected economic data will sour the mood practically on daily basis for at least the first half of the year.In this respect, the preliminary PMI figures released yesterday were cataclysmic for most economies in March, with the services sector which accounts for an overwhelming majority of the developed economies taking an unprecedented hit due to a complete shutdown of activity.But in the long-term, the equity markets have always recovered from the harshest shocks and came out stronger, at least in terms of pricing, following financial crisis.NEWSFLASH: Inflation in the UK has fallen, given some support to households struggling to cope with the impact of Covid-19.Cheaper petrol helped to pull inflation down.This data, incidentally, would normally be released at 9.30am. But the ONS has brought such market-sensitive data forward to 7am, because its usual ‘lock-ins’ (which allow reporters time to digest data) have been suspended due to Covid-19 isolation rules.Marketwatch say US lawmakers have agreed a “massive stimulus measure to try to keep Americans whole”: The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.CNN says Capitol Hill could vote on the plan later today: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell described it as “a war-time level of investment for our nation,” and said that the Senate would move to pass it later in the day on Wednesday.The Senate will re-convene at noon. An exact time has not yet been set for the vote.The full details have yet to be released But over the last 24 hours, the elements of the proposal have come into sharper focus, with $250 billion set aside for direct payments to iniduals and families, $350 billion in small business loans, $250 billion in unemployment insurance benefits and $500 billion in loans for distressed companies. The Financial Times, though, says investors should be cautious:Markets are putting faith in unprecedented intervention by governments around the world. Senior Senate Republicans and Democrats said late on Tuesday that they had agreed on the biggest congressional bailout in US history after the support package had twice been delayed by arguments over what to include.But Robert Carnell, head of Asia-Pacific research at ING, described the equity gains this week as a “sucker rally” in light of the challenges still facing global markets. The rapid increase in coronavirus cases worldwide was “eye-watering”, he said. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal.”Those words, from White House director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland, are cheering investors - and may help to turn the tide in the markets.Ueland revealed a couple of hours ago that US Senate leaders have reached a deal with the Trump administration on a nearly $2tn stimulus package.It’s designed to protect Americans from the worst of the looming recession.The package will include direct payments for US families, and support for businesses.The text of the deal isn’t quite finalised, but all sides appear to be behind it, as my colleague Lauren Gambino reports from Washington: After days of around-the-clock negotiations amongst senators and administration officials, a bipartisan compromise was struck over what is expected to be the largest US economic stimulus measure ever passed.“We have a deal,” said Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, just before 1am, adding that the text of the bill still needed to be completed. “We have either, clear, explicit legislative text reflecting all parties or we know exactly where we’re going to land on legislative text as we continue to finish.”The bill will then go to the House, and then to Donald Trump, who is expected to ratify it.Markets have rallied in Asia today too, amid relief that governments and central banks are throwing their weight behind stimulus measures, as economic activity slumps.But this surely isn’t the end of the coronavirus pandemic? Older City heads will remember that bear markets often see such wild swings. Investors really want to see signs that the medical crisis is being brought under control - and we’re a long way from that position in the UK, the rest of Europe, or America (where president Trump is keen to end lockdowns despite medical warnings).So the markets will probably remain volatile for a while.As Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group puts it:Two ways it could easily all go pear-shaped is 1. The virus spread just gets out of hand andor 2. The stimulus isn’t enough to give the economy a shot in the arm after being laid comatose in lockdown.Trump would like to see US ‘reopen’ by Easter Sunday on April 12, which seems optimistic.Today we learn how UK inflation changed last month, how much retail sales have fallen this month, and how badly German business confidence has been damaged by the crisis"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f96b5ca75c76c48827dea05932bd5be727931904/0_232_6964_4179/master/6964.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2bf8092a83e271289f4b0d4a41d1a0f8","title":"britain benefits rishi sunak claimants austerity","story":"A decade of cuts has ripped apart the safety net. People on decent salaries hit by the Covid-19 fallout are in for a shockMillions of people are about to discover something they didn’t know about British life. There is no longer a safety net. People who have paid tax and national insurance for years and never been near the social security system will be turning to it in their hour of need yet far too late, like trapeze artists falling through the air, they will find that the net beneath them has been lowered dangerously close to the ground and is badly torn.If these people once believed relentlessly misleading tabloid tales of benefit scroungers, they will have a rude awakening. They will find that when Iain Duncan Smith turned the screw on social security in 2012, he was right to warn claimants: “This is not an easy life any more, chum.” As if it ever was.Let’s hope that injustice is fixed. But even then, watch the shock as millions fall on the untender mercies of the Department for Work and Pensions, to discover what happened to benefits in the past decade. While never over-generous, by 2010 Labour had greatly lifted living standards for low earners, especially for children: Gordon Brown’s tax credits raised a million children and a million pensioners out of poverty. Since 2010, according to new research by Kerris Cooper and John Hills, a professor at the London School of Economics, children have lost a quarter of the support they had chancellor George Osborne and his successors took out a staggering nearly £40bn from benefits. Never “all in this together”, Osborne justified it by raining down abuse on low-paid families. The hypocrisy: as the current editor of the London Evening Standard, he ran Christmas collections for poor families! The Resolution Foundation predicts a third of children falling into poverty by 2023.Some cuts were secretive, uprating benefits by a meaner CPI not RPI inflation rate, a four-year freeze, and axing council tax support. Some made a noise – such as the bedroom tax, costing some families £14 week for a spare room. An early case was a Hartlepool family whose empty room belonged to their recently deceased 10-year-old. Housing benefit for renters was cut brutally. Introducing the two-child limit was exceptionally unjust.Torsten Bell, head of the Resolution Foundation, says people on £50,000 salaries have been anxiously asking him about benefits rates. They’re in for a shock, he says. Unlike the previous tax credit system, universal credit only allows savings of £6,000 (it takes steep deductions from savings up to £16,000). People hoping this is only temporary will be distraught at having to use up their rainy-day funds, often saved for years for a deposit on a home. The foundation is lobbying urgently to have this savings means-test dropped.Hills says a couple with two children will get £266 a week. And take from that £115 – the average amount that housing benefit falls short of rental payments. Many new claimants will run up rent arrears. Expect them to plunge immediately into poverty, miles below the £384 minimum income standard for a family of four, says Hills. Some singles will get a shock too. Under-35s will be living on £73, and only funded for a room in a shared flat, in the cheapest third of rentals in the area. Many who see themselves as middle class will confront the reality of Britain’s nonexistent safety net. It is, says the IFS’s Paul Johnson, “extraordinarily low”. One piece of advice from all these experts I’ve talked to: apply immediately, to limit these delays and debts. “Too many will wait, borrow from family, deny it’s happening to them, feeling the stigma. Apply at once,” says Torsten Bell.These millions discovering DWP brutality at first hand will no longer be deceived by the old poison shaming those on benefits as loafers, frauds and “not people like us”. Benefits offer penury, not a life of Riley. Rishi Sunak has been lavishly praised, not least for his empathic language: “We will be judged by our capacity for compassion”. But his compassion will be judged by how far he keeps benefit rates below the most basic poverty line."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/551b1fe4e53e18d9ab0d1f570e176b257b2c69fc/0_0_5064_3038/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=946001468bfeb765688bcc011d0f2bcb","title":"deliveroo driver coronavirus help contract government hardship fund","story":"People like me are key workers, yet we still have no safety net from the government and face poverty if we self-isolate• See all our coronavirus coverageIf you order in with Deliveroo, I’m the guy who brings it to you, day or night, no matter the weather and whatever the risk. And those risks are greater now than I ever imagined they could be. With the UK on lockdown, I and thousands of other delivery workers are still out there trying to get provisions to people who need them – and at the same time keep roofs over our heads.Yet it sometimes feels like we’re working with a timebomb in our backpack. And the government is not taking our role in the Covid-19 crisis seriously.I’m a father of three and I’m used to working 12-hour days. It was June 2018 when I swapped my green Starbucks apron for a bulky backpack and a pushbike. Like many, I was lured in by slogans like “Earn great money”, “Choose when you work”, “Make as much as £120 a day”. The dream of flexible, well-paid self-employment was real and I was ready to pedal after it. I’d been pedalling ever since, until two weeks ago when I developed a cough and breathing difficulties.Even though I was desperate to protect those around me, making the decision to self-isolate was extremely difficult because my partner is on statutory maternity pay and the family relies on my income. We’re not eligible for statutory sick pay at Deliveroo, so I was relieved when the company announced a multimillion-pound Rider Support Fund that promised financial support for those forced to self-isolate. I wasn’t expecting much from Deliveroo but at least, in these extraordinary times, it was offering something. So I went into isolation.Yet I didn’t see a penny. Deliveroo asked me to submit medical proof but after calling 111 it was madeclear that for someone like me, getting proof was not feasible. So for practical purposes, the promise of hardship supportturned out to be an empty one: Deliveroo did not pay out. I have since found out that many other delivery and driver companies have promised sickness support to their workers but failed to deliver. With no real rights and protections for gig economy workers like me, it’s going to get harder and harder for people who should self-isolate to make the right choice. In the end I was lucky to be able to rely on friends and family for help with essentials, but have still had to cut back on a lot of basics.The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said that workers on zero-hours contracts are eligible for help under the job retention scheme. But that doesn’t apply to people like me because we’re not on contract. So he basically said I have to keep on waiting. That is not good enough. I can’t feed my family on promises from the chancellor, I need certainty and I need cash.Last week the government classified couriers as key workers. The job we do is vital to the protection of public health, whether we’re delivering food or medical supplies. Every day of waiting could cost lives. That’s why the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain  is taking legal action against the government for failing to protect precarious workers like me.And it’s not just the couriers. It’s the cleaners, the minicab drivers, the care workers, and many others who are all on the frontline, every day. We’ve been campaigning for years to win recognition of our basic employment rights. It shouldn’t be such a struggle to rectify this injustice, especially during a pandemic with so many thousands of lives hanging in the balance.As long as self-isolation is a privilege for those who can afford it, there is a danger that workers will turn up for a shift when they shouldn’t, with all that risks that entails. It’s clear that many gig-economy employers won’t give sufficient priority to public health. The government says it will stand behind businesses – but how many people have to die before they finally step up and stand behind us too?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c64aa984044dfec0a6dca10f06ace89f479b501f/0_175_4256_2555/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4bfcb8e7c7fe8f3d02d62aed012c32c9","title":"social distancing government covid 19","story":"In the Covid-19 crisis, iniduals must act responsibly. But weak and complacent messaging has had predictable results Backed into a corner, Boris Johnson has announced an unprecedented lockdown on Britain’s public life. The solemn tone of last night’s address carried the heavy weight of reluctance. For days, the government’s messaging has been that the public were failing to practice social distancing of their own accord, with sources saying there was “total fury” across Westminster over people flouting orders and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, accusing those still gathering of being “very selfish”.You don’t have to be too cynical to feel that this language sounds a lot like the government preparing to play its get out of jail card, whereby it offers vague and unenforceable “advice”, points disapprovingly to those ignoring it, and is then free to shift blame for the inevitable rise in coronavirus cases on to the public.From the beginning, the government’s communications strategy has bordered on lethal complacency. It told the public its plan was “herd immunity”, which required many to catch the virus, only to backtrack as if it had never said it. Johnson only closed pubs and restaurants at the weekend, having previously offered social distancing guidance that never cut through. Until Tuesday’s address, ministers have used paywalled articles and a 5pm briefing to get information across, rather than the blanket national TV ads and billboards you would expect. It has even emerged that the government can’t send advice on coronavirus directly to Britons’ mobile phones because it repeatedly ignored its own findings that an emergency messaging system could help in times of crisis. Instead, it had to rely on mobile network operators.The result has been all too predictable. People in the UK have flocked to seaside towns and beauty spots in recent days as many families appeared to view schools closing as an opportunity for an early Easter holiday. Parks were filled with groups of friends obliviously meeting up in the sunshine. New data confirms the UK has been lagging behind other countries in measures such as cutting down our restaurant visits and working at home.The social distancing shambles has led to some uncomfortable “punching down”, such as high-profile online accounts mocking people for queuing at supermarkets. But a focus on blaming the public risks letting the government – the party with power, resources and reach – off the hook. There is a middle ground, however. It is possible to think adults have a personal responsibility to consider their high-risk neighbours while believing the government has heavily influenced their failure to do so by poor communication and slow action.The theme of personal responsibility often becomes toxic when used politically – whether it’s claiming that “the poor wouldn’t need food banks if only they budgeted properly”, or “the long-term sick would get off benefits if they had enough motivation”. But you don’t have to be a libertarian to understand that inidual behaviour is key in a pandemic, or to believe that we have a duty to think of each other. While political structures strongly determine our choices, free will still means we hold some responsibility for them. To put it another way: leisure venues being open for so long in the UK was a psychological nudge that gave many people “permission” to still use them – but it was still up to each of us if we chose a fun outing with mates over listening to calls to protect someone else’s life. An 18-year-old with underlying health problems died this weekend. I wonder how many nights out at the pub they’ll miss out on.Public behaviour in the light of Johnson’s hands-off approach could be compared to smoking, in that smokers were well aware of the risk of cancer but it took legislative action to discourage many of them. But it’s actually more like passive smoking: continuing to socialise in the face of coronavirus, and the state refusing to strongly step in, didn’t just endanger iniduals themselves, but other people at higher risk. Perhaps instead of photos of damaged lungs on fag packets, the government should be running ads of grandmas in ICU gasping for air. If this is hard to hear, it should be. People are dying. People are trapped inside their homes afraid. Others have enjoyed a day trip to the beach.For years, Britain’s political culture has stoked a dog-eat-dog inidualism, just as it has cast doubt on experts. We should not be shocked that those particular chickens are now coming home to roost. The government is finally introducing the state-led intervention this pandemic requires. But in the coming weeks values, as well as the law, are going to be what helps us get through this. A recognition that we are all more interconnected than appeared to be case. That inidual want doesn’t trump community need. That disabled and older people’s lives are worth protecting. Some things should not need legislation.• Frances Ryan is a  columnist and author of Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c9c1b386c4192826a182e64de29b7c845ab5153/427_165_3394_2036/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5b96f858b9078b6ae302e5b2562372","title":"the guardian view on the coronavirus big state its here to stay","story":"To combat the pandemic government will have to get larger and more intrusive. That will need careful handling in the long runBoris Johnson’s declaration of war on an invisible, elusive and advancing foe was long overdue. His reluctance to wage an effective campaign left the nation dangerously exposed to the deadly threat coronavirus posed. The prime minister had given the impression that this episode was a test of Darwinian fitness for the public and it would be possible to get through it without any upheaval to the post-election order. That was a substantial error of both judgment and ideology, the scale of which was laid bare by the government’s own analysis that an unmitigated epidemic could lead to 510,000 deaths.Panic gripped and enlarged Leviathan, the sovereign power meant to protect us from one another. Harried by the bond markets, seeing parts of the economy approaching collapse and with the Covid-19 death toll creeping upwards, Mr Johnson’s government first created £200bn to stave off a run on its bonds, then nationalised the railways and finally ordered the population to stay behind locked doors.During the crisis, Mr Johnson has been forced to implement measures – such as limiting movement and policing quarantines – that infringe on liberties to preserve life. Covid-19 has already disrupted economic, social and spiritual life. Iniduals will submit to restrictions. But that consent is conditional on sacrifices being equally shared. It’s no good expanding the state to save businesses but not people. That is why Labour is right to push the government to produce a support package for the self-employed and to get protective equipment to medics.While the prime minister looked all at sea, his opponents within and without the Conservative party have been admirably clear about the gravity of the situation. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, is beginning to establish himself as a prophet who had been right all along. He has been ahead of the curve with his warnings about the scale of the crisis. This is not something to cavil at, even when there is a general agreement over the need for national purpose. In our democracy, government is accountable to parliament, and politicians’ reputations are built by their arguments being vindicated by events.The habits of mind that need to be cultivated by government to succeed with this approach are transparency and trust, neither of which come easily to Mr Johnson’s team, who sometimes view criticism as unpatriotic. What is required is a high level of candour and accountability. Mr Johnson has to act decisively. He will probably adopt policies to combat the pandemic so intrusive and big they would be considered bizarre in normal times. But these are not normal times. In the longer term his expanded state must be a supportive – rather than corrosive – one."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd7fb896db07248e1eefa024ce8d48b9aff82d8b/0_0_6149_3691/master/6149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93ab9687b2dc9273227e3ce7870dd12c","title":"covid 19 is natures wake up call to complacent civilisation","story":"A bubble has finally been burst – but will we now attend to the other threats facing humanity?We have been living in a bubble, a bubble of false comfort and denial. In the rich nations, we have begun to believe we have transcended the material world. The wealth we’ve accumulated – often at the expense of others – has shielded us from reality. Living behind screens, passing between capsules – our houses, cars, offices and shopping malls – we persuaded ourselves that contingency had retreated, that we had reached the point all civilisations seek: insulation from natural hazards.Now the membrane has ruptured, and we find ourselves naked and outraged, as the biology we appeared to have banished storms through our lives. The temptation, when this pandemic has passed, will be to find another bubble. We cannot afford to succumb to it. From now on, we should expose our minds to the painful realities we have denied for too long.The planet has multiple morbidities, some of which will make this coronavirus look, by comparison, easy to treat. One above all others has come to obsess me in recent years: how will we feed ourselves? Fights over toilet paper are ugly enough: I hope we never have to witness fights over food. But it’s becoming difficult to see how we will avoid them.A large body of evidence is beginning to accumulate showing how climate breakdown is likely to affect our food supply. Already farming in some parts of the world is being hammered by drought, floods, fire and locusts (whose resurgence in the past few weeks appears to be the result of anomalous tropical cyclones). When we call such hazards “biblical”, we mean that they are the kind of things that happened long ago, to people whose lives we can scarcely imagine. Now, with increasing frequency, they are happening to us.In his forthcoming book, Our Final Warning, Mark Lynas explains what is likely to happen to our food supply with every extra degree of global heating. He finds that extreme danger kicks in somewhere between 3C and 4C above pre-industrial levels. At this point, a series of interlocking impacts threatens to send food production into a death spiral. Outdoor temperatures become too high for humans to tolerate, making subsistence farming impossible across Africa and South Asia. Livestock die from heat stress. Temperatures start to exceed the lethal thresholds for crop plants across much of the world, and major food producing regions turn into dust bowls. Simultaneous global harvest failure – something that has never happened in the modern world – becomes highly likely.In combination with a rising human population, and the loss of irrigation water, soil and pollinators, this could push the world into structural famine. Even today, when the world has a total food surplus, hundreds of millions are malnourished as a result of the unequal distribution of wealth and power. A food deficit could result in billions starving. Hoarding will happen, as it always has, at the global level, as powerful people snatch food from the mouths of the poor. Yet, even if every nation keeps its promises under the Paris agreement, which currently seems unlikely, global heating will amount to between 3C and 4C.Thanks to our illusion of security, we are doing almost nothing to anticipate this catastrophe, let alone prevent it. This existential issue scarcely seems to impinge on our consciousness. Every food-producing sector claims that its own current practices are sustainable and don’t need to change. When I challenge them, I’m met with a barrage of anger and abuse, and threats of the kind I haven’t experienced since I opposed the Iraq war. Sacred cows and holy lambs are everywhere, and the thinking required to develop the new food systems that we need, like lab-grown food, is scarcely anywhere.But this is just one of our impending crises. Antibiotic resistance is, potentially, as deadly as any new disease. One of the causes is the astonishingly profligate way in which these precious medicines are used on many livestock farms. Where vast numbers of farm animals are packed together, antibiotics are deployed prophylactically to prevent otherwise inevitable outbreaks of disease. In some parts of the world, they are used not only to prevent disease, but also as growth promoters. Low doses are routinely added to feed: a strategy that could scarcely be better designed to deliver bacterial resistance.In the US, where 27 million people have no medical cover, some people are now treating themselves with veterinary antibiotics, including those sold, without prescription, to medicate pet fish. Pharmaceutical companies are failing to invest sufficiently in the search for new drugs. If antibiotics cease to be effective, surgery becomes almost impossible. Childbirth becomes a mortal hazard once more. Chemotherapy can no longer be safely practised. Infectious diseases we have comfortably forgotten become deadly threats. We should discuss this issue as often as we talk about football. But again, it scarcely registers.Our multiple crises, of which these are just two, have a common root. The problem is exemplified by the response of the organisers of the Bath Half Marathon, a massive event that took place on 15 March, to the many people begging them to cancel. “It is now too late for us to cancel or postpone the event. The venue is built, the infrastructure is in place, the site and our contractors are ready.” In other words, the sunk costs of the event were judged to outweigh any future impacts – the potential transmission of disease, and possible deaths – it might cause.The amount of time it took the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games could reflect similar judgments – but at least they got there in the end. Sunk costs within the fossil fuel industry, farming, banking, private healthcare and other sectors prevent the rapid transformations we need. Money becomes more important than life.There are two ways this could go. We could, as some people have done, double down on denial. Some of those who have dismissed other threats, such as climate breakdown, also seek to downplay the threat of Covid-19. Witness the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, who claims that the coronavirus is nothing more than “a little flu”. The media and opposition politicians who have called for lockdown are, apparently, part of a conspiracy against him.Or this could be the moment when we begin to see ourselves, once more, as governed by biology and physics, and dependent on a habitable planet. Never again should we listen to the liars and the deniers. Never again should we allow a comforting falsehood to trounce a painful truth. No longer can we afford to be dominated by those who put money ahead of life. This coronavirus reminds us that we belong to the material world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5471cd5414a097d233dfeb5d11ff6a837b64771b/0_473_6401_3841/master/6401.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b51a4b46b37e7a0edfa3a56f5f728aa4","title":"arts workers what effect has coronavirus had on your job","story":"As redundancies are suddenly made across arts venues forced to close their doors, we want to hear from youAs the UK government introduces measures to protect workers who will lose earnings during the coronavirus, amid calls to introduce similar measures for the self-employed, there are reports of employers letting staff go with little or no notice.The arts sector is particularly at risk: cinemas, concert venues, theatres and galleries have all been closed.

It could be that the device has stopped working or that, sadly, Sally is no more.Phil Sheldrake, species recovery officer with the RSPB, said: “It’s great that we have an egg – and quite a bit earlier than last year.”The female on the nest does not have an identity ring, meaning that it is not known if she is the same one that produced four eggs last year, but Sheldrake said it was highly likely that it was the same bird.“Peregrines do not like to be overlooked,” he said. “Salisbury Cathedral sticks out like a sore thumb above the rolling countryside. It’s like a five-star hotel for them.”There are generally three or four eggs in a clutch and incubation doesn’t start until the last egg is laid. Once that has happened, the female – and male - will sit on the nest at intervals to keep eggs warm. Incubation lasts 29-32 days, so if all goes well, chicks should appear in early May.Meanwhile, the tracker attached to Sally, who became a television star after featuring on BBC’s Springwatch in 2017, last pinpointed her on 3 November 2019 above the village of Coombe Bissett, three miles from Salisbury – but no signal has been picked up since.Sheldrake said: “We don’t know if she’s alive or whether the tracker has simply stopped working. We haven’t seen her on the cameras at the cathedral and it’s quite possible the tracking device has just stopped working after nearly three years.“She is possibly 10 now, and whilst the oldest peregrine known was at least 24, the average life is around 10.” The tracker works on solar power, so if Sally has died it would probably not receive enough light to carry on working.Salisbury Cathedral has a historic bond with peregrines, which was broken in the 20th century because of persecution and pesticides. The first pair to breed in modern times arrived in 2014. The birds have done well there since then, apart from in 2018 when no eggs were laid following an unholy scrap between Sally and an unringed female."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e447f81dea87b8015e7ce585bab66d122ad4fa1/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8a4c7016bdefca570a5fb4f7aa7487c","title":"parts of england could run out of water unless urgent action taken report","story":"Auditor general predicts drought in 20 years as demand rises and climate crisis reduces supply England is in danger of experiencing droughts within 20 years unless action is taken to combat the impact of the climate crisis on water availability, the public spending watchdog says.The National Audit Office (NAO), in a report published on Wednesday, says some parts of England, especially the south-east, are at risk of running out of water owing to decreased rainfall and a need to cut the amount taken from natural waterways.Water companies will have to reduce the quantity of water they take out of rivers, lakes and the ground by more than 1bn litres a day, creating huge shortfalls in the coming decades, the NAO warned.Parliament’s auditor predicted that 4bn litres of additional water supply would be needed each day by 2050 to counter the growing risk of drought from the climate emergency.The amount removed will need to be slashed by almost 500m litres a day to ensure sustainable bioersity can continue, while drier weather is expected to see a 600m litre daily reduction in rainfall.According to NAO figures, the daily demand for water in England and Wales is 14bn litres, with the equivalent of 3bn litres of that lost through leakage. People on average use 143 litres of water every 24 hours.Gareth Davies, comptroller and auditor general of the NAO, criticised ministers in his report for failing to lead on the issue of water sustainability. He said personal water consumption had risen every year for the past five years. He called on the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs (Defra) to co-ordinate a national approach to encouraging consumers and public bodies to reduce their water usage in an attempt to avoid water shortages in the coming decades.He said: “The government has made limited progress on reducing water consumption, tackling leakage and sharing water resources between regions in the last five years, but rapid progress is now vital for the government to deliver its objective of a resilient water supply.“Defra needs to provide stronger leadership to water companies, regulators and consumers.”The report said during the past five years water companies had made little or no progress in reducing water consumption and cutting leakage.The report said ministers in 2018 committed to announcing a personal water consumption target but had yet to follow through on the promise.The NAO said it wanted Defra to promote a “more coherent and credible message” about water efficiency and develop a plan to evaluate its impact, with Whitehall leading on getting the message to consumers that they needed to save water.Defra should work with other government departments to reduce water consumption by large public sector users, such as hospitals and schools. The NAO said Defra should also better understand how willing the public were to pay higher water bills in order to improve water infrastructure.The regulator Ofwat and the Environment Agency should also have a role to play in regularly reviewing water companies’ progress on reducing consumption and leakage, the report recommended."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d342ef39b19a7637c0b27513afbb27d49b2174b1/0_85_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5a2ac8619555181d735254ea2246c02","title":"prada the latest fashion brand to make medical face masks","story":"From hospitals to hand sanitiser, a number of big names from continental fashion capitals are turning their efforts towards the fight against the coronavirus. Will the British industry follow suit?Prada is the latest big-name fashion brand to turn its production lines, usually focused on elegant blazers and blouses, to meet needs arising from the coronavirus crisis. Yesterday it said it would produce 110,000 masks by 6 April, while Gucci has said it will make more than 1m and Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga – both of which, like Gucci, are owned by Kering – will also begin manufacturing them.High-street brands are similarly shifting their focus. Last week, Spanish-owned Zara pledged to produce surgical masks, saying it had already donated 10,000 masks and a further 300,000 were due to be sent by the end of this week. Over the weekend, H\u0026ampM Group said it would be rearranging its supply chain to produce protective equipment for hospitals and healthcare workers.It is hoped that brands might soon follow suit in the UK, with the British Fashion Council the not-for-profit organisation that promotes British design globally, last week asking those with “production capacity” to help with shortages. NHS workers in the UK have been speaking out against shortages of protective gear, with London paramedics being rationed to one face mask between two, despite the under-fire UK health secretary Matt Hancock saying yesterday that he had ordered “millions of masks”.The move to make masks follows on from LVMH’s announcement, earlier this month, that it would convert three of its factories, which usually manufacture perfumes under labels such as Givenchy and Guerlain, to the production of hand sanitiser.Donatella Versace last week pledged more than $200,000 to the intensive care unit of Milan’s San Raffaele hospital Mayhoola, the parent company of Valentino and Balmain, yesterday pledged $2m to the coronavirus effort Giorgio Armani donated $1.4m to four of Italy’s busiest hospitals and the chief executive of Gucci, Marco Bizzarri, gave $100,000 to hospitals in the northern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna, another of the hardest hit areas of the country. Money from a crowd-funding project promoted by the fashion influencer Chiara Ferragni brought in more than €4m for a new intensive care ward Milan’s San Raffaele hospital.So far, in the UK, altruistic fashion initiatives have been on a much smaller scale, with social enterprises launching T-shirts emblazoned with slogans from “Isolate, Just Do It” to raise money for the food bank network Trussell Trust, to “National Hero Service” to raise money for the NHS. The London-based sustainable designer Phoebe English announced last week that she would be making face masks for medical professionals. While stores are shut, the shoe brand Kurt Geiger is asking its 2,500 staff to volunteer in local communities and has partnered with Age UK to help – all staff, apart from the company’s CEO, will continue to be paid."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f46dc4c413e6d0a6b29404c19864aac8984db360/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30249ab30fd1bfdedb236d14e7fe6206","title":"best running kit reflective night in pictures","story":"From tops to bum bags, socks and trainers, here are reflective pieces for running at night "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b445db160d98b21ba3af023fa36a25c13c70e6f/63_1551_3379_2025/master/3379.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eaae52de40b782375874a222dab3ef06","title":"is reheated rice safe to eat","story":"So long as you store it properly, there’s no reason to be afraid of reheating cooked rice. It’s the building block for many a great dishCan you explain the dos and don’ts of cooked rice? I thought it was dangerous to eat unless it’s chilled straight after cooking, but I know people who ignore this with apparent impunity.Tiff, Bath, SomersetCan reheated cooked rice cause food poisoning? Yes, is the straight answer – though it’s not usually poor reheating skills that are to blame, but bad storage practices. As food scientist extraordinaire Harold McGee notes in his epic tome On Food \u0026amp Cooking, “Raw rice almost always carries dormant spores of the bacterium Bacillus cereus, which produces powerful gastrointestinal toxins.” These, in turn, can cause unpleasantness, though thankfully only a relatively mild dose compared with other forms of food poisoning.Those spores can even survive the cooking process, so the longer rice is kept at room temperature afterwards, the more likely bacteria are to thrive. Which is one reason, among many, to be thankful that those pea and sweetcorn-flecked rice salads so beloved of 20th-century buffets are rarely seen these days. To prevent bacterial growth, McGee advises chilling any cooked grains within four hours, though the NHS suggests even greater caution, saying to cool it down as fast as possible and get it in the fridge inside an hour it also recommends binning cooked rice after 24 hours, never to reheat it more than once and to make sure it’s piping hot all the way through, which McGee, in typically thorough fashion, sets at 73C or above.All that said, many wonderful dishes, from Asian fried rice to Indian rice pakora and Italian arancini, rely on cooked rice as their starting point, so please don’t be too put off, Tiff. As Ben Curtis, head chef at Thai restaurant Smoking Goat in London, says: “To make good fried rice, you need to start with ‘old’ cooked rice.” To meet food safety requirements, Curtis chills his rice to below 5C within 90 minutes of cooking, but once you’ve ticked that safety box, he says, the next day the fried rice world is your oyster.As noted in this column before, the secret to great fried rice is a well-seasoned wok. “The aroma, or ‘breath’, of the wok lends the rice a slight char and smokiness,” Curtis explains. “And keep the wok very hot throughout, to avoid ending up with something upsettingly claggy.” Don’t be shy with the fat or oil, either: “You need a decent amount to make sure you fry the rice, rather than sweat it.” Hot and quick are key here. The Chinese tend to keep additional flavourings to a mimimum, but Thais have no such qualms, Curtis says. He adds lardo for richness – “You can get something similar at home with salted chunks of belly fat or lardons” – and tempers the fatty pork with a nam prik chilli relish, sweet fried onions, garlic, Turkish green peppers and fish sauce. “The more layers of spice, aroma and texture you have, the better.” (He adds that Thais also love fermenting fish or pork in sticky rice by leaving it somewhere humid and warm before frying, but wouldn’t recommend trying the same unless you really know what you’re doing.)As for arancini, the rice may be a different variety, but the same food hygiene standards apply to arborio and carnaroli as to long-grain, says Francesco Mazzei, who runs the kitchens at Sartoria, Fiume and Radici, all in London. “Risotto is a north Italian dish, anyway. Down south, where I’m from, you hardly see it anywhere. We make riso, not risotto, and the rice tends to be boiled from scratch, often in just water with a little saffron, though I prefer stock.”There’s a lot more to cooked riso than arancini, too, Mazzei adds. “We use it in all sorts, from croquettes to stuffed peppers to sartu di riso, a kind-of-lasagne pie made with layers of vegetables, meat and rice instead of pasta.” Mind you, in his family the appearance of rice at the table was usually bad news: “Whenever Mum made rice, we all knew it meant someone was ill. Though how rice with lentils can cure anyone is still a mystery – it’s so boring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be8fb456011e6000fe9000278c99d228b0f5dd5/0_117_3447_2068/master/3447.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4fe7a2c490d1c8868ced1f1f1bb0be0","title":"a letter from italy stop and go inside football coronavirus united","story":"We watched in horror as football continued elsewhere despite the coronavirus monster that has united us as never beforeA few days ago it felt as if the light was finally switched off and since then we have been living in the dark: stopped in our tracks and scared of the silence that has engulfed us. The only sound breaking the silence is that of the ambulances, too many of them, and every single one a punch in our collective gut.I normally report on the transfer market for the  but at the moment I am not writing about that. Which player is on the move is not important at a time like this, but I would still like to share my experiences of what we have been through here in Italy in the past few weeks.As a journalist I have seen all of Italy, from Naples, where I was born, to Milan, where I live. As a nation we are all about enjoying ourselves and smiling. Our smiles were not supposed to be kept inside. For the past two weeks we feel as if it is always nighttime: every day, every hour, every moment. Luciano De Crescenzo – a famous Neapolitan philosopher who died last year – told us that time is two-dimensional and that the secret is not to count the days you will live but to make them as special as you can. Mankind studies how to prolong life, when we should be thinking about making the most of it, expanding it.In the past month or so our days have become horribly similar and so, so long as if time is suddenly travelling at a slower speed.I am telling this story from Milan, Italy’s pulsating heart and the most European and thriving city in our country. It is also in the middle of Lombardy, the region most impacted by this pandemic. But from the north to the south our windows tell the same story: look outside and you can see only a few cars and a few people hurrying to buy food.Everywhere people are praying for their loved ones. There is suffering in the hospitals, which are completely full and on the brink of collapse. Every night the updated statistics on the coronavirus feel as if they belong to a war-time era: 500, 600, more than 700 deaths a day, cities on their knees and Italians stuck in their homes.In the hospitals there are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, and sons and daughters working without a break, risking their lives to save others. We take pride in our medical system, like it was a World Cup trophy, and we thank the nurses and doctors from far away, giving them virtual standing ovations from our balconies, singing our national anthem together at times scheduled on social media.Meanwhile, grandparents are having to learn skills to say hello to their grandchildren, whether through Skype or WhatsApp. Others meet friends for chats online. Still, it is not the same and we miss each other terribly.The last football match feels as if it took place a lifetime ago. As it turned out it was a taster of what was to come: games behind closed doors, with no fans and emotions. We were already scared during that awful first weekend in March in Italy when they played football here before the country shut down. We watched in horror as more than 50,000 fans went to Anfield to watch Liverpool play Atlético Madrid on 11 March, when more than 800 people had died here in Italy. That figure has now gone beyond 6,000.We asked ourselves how they were still playing football games and how fans were still allowed to travel. As we were barricading ourselves in our homes, we saw Neymar, Mbappé and their PSG teammates defeat Borussia Dortmund behind closed doors and then some of the players celebrated with a big group of fans outside the stadium. Two days later, they were wearing masks.Normally Italy lives off football every day and every hour, in every bar and on every street corner. “Italians lose football matches like they were wars and lose wars like they were football matches,” Churchill once said and he could not have been more right. But right now, nobody cares about it. When will Serie A come back? What will happen with the Champions League? It does not matter.Maybe it will matter as much again, maybe even more, but at the moment football needs to wait. We were screaming this message to the world when some countries kept playing and carried on living normally: look at what is happening to us! You need to stop and go inside. It was painful to watch England go about their business as if nothing was happening. “What are you doing?” we kept shouting but only belatedly has the prime minister acted.Coronavirus is a battle that must be faced together.

Spoiler: he missesThere’s not much left to say. It wasn’t an epic match - but it was an epic occasion, and we’ll be talking about that first period of extra-time forever. In the end, just as at Italia 90, it ended in the cruellest possible way. For the last two and a half weeks, England’s euphoric Euro 96 campaign has been our entire world. And like that, it’s gone.Terry Venables runs straight over to Gareth Southgate, whose life has just taken the most horrible turn. Jurgen Klinsmann also limps over to console him - and then Tony Adams drags him over to start a lap of honour before beckoning the rest of the England team to join them. There are no tears, as far as I can tell, but a few of the players are close. A lot of them look in shock.It’s over. Moller smashes his penalty down the middle and then mimicks Gascoigne’s peacock celebration. England are out in the most heartbreaking circumstances, again.KOPKE SAVES FROM SOUTHGATE! Germany 5-5 England It was a tame penalty, and Kopke pushed it away as he ed to his right. Now Germany are one kick away from putting England out of Euro 96.It’s Gareth Southgate in fact...KUNTZ SCORES! Germany 5-5 England An unbelievable penalty from Kuntz, who clips it high into the net. Now it’s sudden death. Who’s next for England? It can’t be Ince, surely. You’d have to think it’ll be McManaman or Anderton.SHERINGHAM SCORES! Germany 4-5 England Sheringham curls it into the top corner as well! If Stefan Kuntz doesn’t score, Germany are out.ZIEGE SCORES! Germany 4-4 England Yet another great penalty. Seaman went the right way but it was right in the corner. The standard is stratospheric.GASCOIGNE SCORES! Germany 3-4 England A majestic penalty from Gascoigne, steered into the top corner. He celebrates with a peacock pose and tries to whip the crowd up even more.REUTER SCORES! Germany 3-3 England Seaman got hands on that! He’s furious with himself for not saving it.PEARCE SCORES! Germany 2-3 England Pearce completes the exorcism of 1990, sending Kopke the wrong way. This time he celebrates with a modest thumbs up rather than the full Psycho of Saturday. And now it’s Stuart Pearce...STRUNZ SCORES! Germany 2-2 England Strunz, who came on right at the end of extra-time, places a brilliant penalty into the top-left corner.PLATT SCORES! Germany 1-2 England I was worried about Platt but he has tucked his penalty away, just as he did in Turin six years ago. Kopke went the right way, ing to his left, but the ball had too much height for him to reach. Good penalty.HASSLER SCORES! Germany 1-1 England A terrific penalty, dragged right into the bottom corner. Seaman went the right way but had no chance.Nerveless stuff from Shearer, who curls it high to the right. Paul Ince, by the way, can’t watch. He is sitting down in the centre circle, looking away from goal. He looks like he’s about to vomit.England will go first, as they did on Saturday.“Hi Rob,” says Ruth Purdue. “Hope you’re well. What is England’s record with penalty shoot-outs?”They’ve won one and lost one. GermanyWest Germany have won three and lost one. Of course, those records include the Italia 90 semi-final, when Pearce and Chris Waddle missed and England were beaten.Some England players look more relaxed than others. Shearer looks fine, Gascoigne is chatting away with Venables. It looks like he’s demonstrating what happened with that agonising near miss in the first period of extra time. Jamie Redknapp, most of the back-up players in fact, look relieved that they won’t be facing the firing squad.We know four of the England penalty takers: Shearer, Platt, Pearce and Gascoigne, in that order, all scored against Spain. Robbie Fowler was down for the other one on Saturday. I suppose the man he replaced, Teddy Sheringham, will take the fifth tonight.For the second time in five days, England’s hopes and dreams depend on a penalty shoot-out. It’s a great way to win a game, let’s just say that.120 min Dieter Eilts, who has had an amazing game defensively, makes one last intervention. A bouncing ball from the right kicked up towards Platt, who improvised a neat, speculative header over the defence. Anderton was just about to reach it in the area when Eilts came across to thigh the ball away and run it to safety. The whistle had gone for offside against Anderton, but nobody knew that at the time. 119 min It’s a poor corner, cleared at the near post.119 min England get a very generous corner on the right. Platt was already apologising to his team-mates for cocking things up when the decision went in England’s favour. Matthias Sammer asks the referee what the feck is going on. We’ll never hear the end of it if England score from this. Before the corner is taken, Thomas Strunz replaces the injured Freund.118 min Both teams are still trying to win this. Kuntz’s reverse pass from the right just runs away from the unmarked Bode in the area.116 min Another German injury! It’s Freund who is struggling now, after a challenge from Anderton. He’s stretchered off, so Germany will be down to 10 men until they can sort a replacement.115 min: CHANCE FOR McMANAMAN! Sammer, deep inside the England half, gave the ball away for one of the few times tonight and England charged forward on the counter-attack. Gascoigne, McManaman and Shearer combined before Shearer guided a through pass down the inside-right channel. McManaman got to it first on the edge of the area, just ahead of Eilts, but his first touch took him slightly away from goal. The angle was tight and he could only hit a weary low shot that was easily held by the tumbling Kopke. The break was so fast that McManaman had no support, so he had to go for goal.114 min: INCE HEADS OFF THE LINE! I think Seaman had it covered, but Ince didn’t take any chances. Moller’s deep corner from the left was pulled down on the thigh by the substitute Bode, who hooked it back towards goal on the turn. Ince, standing in front of Seaman in the six-yard box, used his loaf to get the ball clear.113 min Compared to the first half, the second period of extra-time has been an oasis of calm. I wouldn’t say either side has settled for penalties, but they look like they have accepted it’s the likeliest scenario.110 min Another Germany substitution: the limping Thomas Helmer is replaced by the utility player Marco Bode. Germany have had such bad luck with injuries throughout this tournament, and now they have two players - Reuter and Moller - suspended from the final should they get there.107 min Southgate plays a nervous, underhit pass across the face of the England area. For a split-second it looks like Kuntz is going to get there first and move through on goal - but then Adams throws himself at the ball to boot it clear.107 min: ZIEGE MISSES AN EXCELLENT CHANCE! Dear lord, make it stop. This is too much to bear. Ziege, this strutting left-back from Bayern, zips infield and finds Moller in the D. He controls the ball and plays a return pass to Ziege, who gets on the inside of Southgate but pokes the ball wide of the far post from 10 yards. That was another great chance.106 min England begin the second period of extra time. This is it: 15 minutes to score a Golden Goal or it will be penalties, just as it was at Italia 90.Still no sign of any England substitutions. I’d be really tempted to introduce the youthful dynamism of Robbie Fowler or maybe Steve Stone. It would give the crowd a lift as well. Half time in extra time: Germany 1-1 England That was one of the great periods of extra time.105 min Shearer runs Babbel down the right – it’s been a brilliant contest between those two - and crosses low. Sammer’s clearance comes to Anderton, who drags a volley well wide from 25 yards.104 min Another fine interception from Adams, who has been immense. England race down the other end, where McManaman’s curling cross is again just in front of the stretching Gascoigne in the six-yard box. That was nowhere near as close as the earlier chance. Gascoigne’s fitness was criticised earlier in the tournament but he looks England’s liveliest player at the moment.102 min A couple of uneventful minutes. It’s as if both teams are having an unspoken timeout after that astonishing start to extra-time.101 min “Hi Rob,” says George Wright. “I’m only 12 and yet to get any sense of perspective, which I’m sure will come any day now. It’s so tense that I’ve already cried once and I spent the break before extra-time playing an aggressive game of wall-ie in my friend’s back yard to let off some steam.”100 min I’ve never seen anything like these last few minutes, never in all ma puff. Replays show what happened with Gascoigne’s chance. He was in front of Sammer and Freund – but then he half stopped, because he thought Kopke was going to get a touch on the ball. Had he kept going he would have run the bal into the net, and he’d probably still be celebrating in the dentist’s chair come the new millennium.99 min: HOW DID GASCOIGNE NOT SCORE THERE?! Gascoigne is a stud’s length away from winning the match! He started the move by winning the ball off Hassler on the England left. Anderton then gave it to Sheringham, who drove a crossfield pass towards Shearer on the right of the area. He pulled away from Babbel, watched the ball onto his right foot and belted a volley back across goal. It bobbled past the ing Kopke in the six-yard box, leaving Gascoigne in front of an open goal – but somehow he missed the ball as he lunged with his left foot. I have no idea what happened. It was an open goal, and he seemed certain to score. Gascoigne ended up in the net, face down. If only the ball was with him. Nobody scripts this stuff, nobody.97 min Germany burst forward again. Hassler finds Moller, whose cross is brilliantly headed away by … McManaman. This is incredible. A chess match has suddenly morphed into basketball.97 min Having seen a replay, I think that probably was a foul by Kuntz, who dragged Southgate out of the way as the corner came in. It was still a brave decision from Sandor Puhl, because I don’t think anyone spotted it at the time. Kuntz’s lack of complaint probably tells a story.97 min: KUNTZ HAS A GOAL DISALLOWED! I thought England were out of Euro 96. Moller’s inswinging corner from the left was headed into the top corner by Kuntz, despite Gascoigne attempting to punch it clear on the line. Time stood still … until everyone realised the referee had blown for a foul by Kuntz on Southgate. That looks really soft to me - I don’t think Luntz did anything wrong. “The country’s pulse rate,” says Barry Davies, “must be beyond natural science.”96 min: GOOD SAVE BY SEAMAN! This is heart-stopping stuff. Moller gets a lucky ricochet off Ince in his own half and surges into a very big gap. It’s a three-on-three break, with the central player Adams trying to hold things up for as long as possible. Eventually Moller gets to within 25 yards of goal and hammers a rising drive that Seaman tips acrobatically over the bar.95 min And now Anderton’s snapshot is blocked by Babbel. So much for the Golden Goal promoting caution. Both teams are swinging haymakers all over the place.94 min Now Germany threaten to win it! Eilts, on the left wing, stabs a pass inside to the marauding Helmer. He looks up and absolutely leathers a cross that flashes across the six-yard box, just in front of Kuntz.93 min: ANDERTON HITS THE POST!!!! England were this close to winning the match after just 80 seconds of extra time. Platt played an excellent pass infield to find McManaman in space on the right of the area. His pull-back was missed by the ing Kopke and reached the unmarked Anderton, who screwed it off the near post and back into the arms of Kopke! That is unbelievable.The ball from McManaman was slightly behind Anderton, which is why he hit it onto the post rather than into the net. But had he put it in front of Anderton, Kopke would have got to it. Sammer punches the air in the direction of the linesman – he was busy appealing for offside against McManaman, which is why Anderton had so much space in the middle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fbc8650362ff8870dfd5a6e321d9294ac3876c6/0_495_3397_2038/master/3397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bf17b438c93cf2031b63325b05d0b3e","title":"the philippines and the struggle to maintain physical distance in lockdown in pictures","story":"The Philippines has taken drastic measures to combat the spread of Covid-19.

Warning: you may cryIt only takes a fraction of a second, but a smile has the power to change everything. And that’s not just for those on the receiving end. According to a 2019 meta-analysis of data from more than 100 studies, smiling makes the person who’s doing it feel happier. From the flash of a grin by a stranger on the bus to the beam of a parent as their children stride through the door, even the most casual smiles have an emotional weight that we feel on an almost cellular level. Here, we chart the power of smiles, from birth to old age.My wife seemed to bond with our daughter immediately. I loved her from the off – I mean, it helped that she looked a lot like me – but it wasn’t in that overwhelming way that I’d hoped for.Mainly, I felt out of my depth. Our baby was so tiny, I was terrified of damaging her. I only got two weeks of paternity leave and because she was breastfeeding I wasn’t as hands-on as I’d hoped. In a way, I was jealous of the bond my wife had with her.But then, when my daughter was two months old, she smiled at me. I experienced this huge rush of love I remember thinking: “I’m your dad …” and it blew my mind. It was the first time I felt properly like a dad. I’m pretty sure I had a tear in my eye. Now our daughter is one and she smiles at me all the time. I still can’t really get over it. And I suppose it helps that she still looks a lot like me.The second time my best friend asked me to be her bridesmaid, I accepted with trepidation. She’d got engaged to her first partner very soon after they met, and afterwards she spent years dealing with the emotional fallout of the breakup.So when she met someone new, I cautioned her to take it slow. Within a few months, though, she announced their engagement. Though I was delighted that she was happy, I feared history would repeat itself.The wedding took a year to plan and my worry wouldn’t subside. I kept my distance from my friend’s new partner. A few times I tried to say that maybe they should slow down or postpone the wedding. “It’s different this time,” she said. But I could see my advice was bothering her.Eventually, I decided it wasn’t a good idea for me to be a bridesmaid. As the big day drew closer, the gap between us seemed to widen and I worried that I’d lost my best friend.The thing that finally convinced me that this time was different was seeing her smile as the marriage was made official. She was so obviously, radiantly happy. I burst into tears and ran to hug her and her new wife. Five years later, they’re more in love than ever and her partner has become one of my best friends too. I think of that as the smile that saved our friendship.Six years ago, I collapsed face first into the porcelain bathroom sink. My bottom teeth came clean (well, bloodily) through my lip. My top teeth splintered like ice on a frozen puddle. It turned out that I was haemorrhaging internally due to a duodenal ulcer it was so bad that I was in danger of a heart attack. An emergency surgery, two blood transfusions and five nights in hospital later, I’d pulled through.But what about the shrapnel formerly known as my teeth? For a few agonising weeks, I waited to find out if there was any hope of turning my stumps into anything even slightly approximating my old smile. “The teeth may die,” the dentist warned.I don’t recall that time very well, I think I was in shock. But I clearly remember the day that I finally got my teeth fixed. I looked in the mirror and felt so relieved to recognise myself again. That smile represented the end of an ordeal. It was the first time I realised how amazing it was that I’d survived.As a palliative care nurse, my patients are often unresponsive. It’s very hard for their families. “Do you think he heard me?” they ask. “Is it worth us talking to them?” The truth is, we can’t know for sure. But I also tell these families the story of how I ended up in my job.The day I decided to apply, I was caring for an elderly patient who’d been unresponsive. I chatted to him but he didn’t seem to hear me. Then his wife – they’d been married for about 60 years – came in and said: “Hello”. The moment he heard her, he smiled.I’ll never forget his amazing smile – I felt incredibly privileged to have witnessed that moment. I immediately put in a request to join the palliative care team and, four years later, I still absolutely love what I do.Read more at tepeuk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/371e2e9e97c20b46d5f2e169c365d44bf353a1a9/4989_1431_6696_4019/master/6696.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8db95dd48512597d572aa913861f67f","title":"be toothful eight fascinating facts about smiling","story":" We smile when we feel good and we feel good when we grin even more.

Whatever the reasons, one thing is undeniable: it’s just absolutely adorable.The UK cosmetic dentistry industry is worth £2bnAccording to market research group Mintel, we’re so obsessed with having the perfect smile that, each year, as a nation it is estimated that we collectively spend billions on whitening, straightening and generally primping our teeth.

Which is happy news, as new research shows smiling can really improve our mood, spurring a chemical reaction in our brains. As adults, we smile 20-40 times a day – finding joy in small moments that matter is as important as taking care of your teeth and gums. Here, six people share what makes them smile.Hazel Gardiner, 41, floral artist“My dog, Ringo, has made me smile from the moment we met. He was the puppy in a lively litter of goldendoodles who came straight over, desperate to be near me. Ringo is really loving but has some funny quirks. He’s not scared of lightning, but if he sees a luggage trolley he freaks out. He’s also a ball stealer at the park. He can hold three in his mouth, so you need an extra ball to get him to drop them. There have been times when I’ve walked him in the morning and been late for work because he won’t drop someone else’s ball. Now, we take five with us just in case. If I’m working on my laptop, Ringo will nudge my hand with his nose for a cuddle. I’m smiling just thinking about him. I’ve made it my mission to look after my teeth and, as a result, I’m a big smiler.”Sukhi Wahiwala, 45, small business coach“In the Sikh faith we believe that, at a certain point, the roles reverse and children look after their parents. Sadly, a year ago, my mother passed away. Helping my father deal with the loss after 65 years of marriage has been challenging, but positive too. My four children call him Papaji. Because we’re so close, each one of us has been able to be a part of my mum for him. I’m my father’s sounding board. I love listening to stories from his youth. We often talk about my mum’s encyclopedic knowledge and we laugh when I prompt him in the same way she would, bringing his memory back to life.”Nick Gaskell, 35, mortgage adviser“I’ve always struggled with my teeth. I have weak gums from lack of brushing as a child, and my two front teeth cross over. Now I pay serious attention to cleaning my teeth thoroughly and I smile with more confidence. And it shows when I’m doing what I love – gardening. My girlfriend and I recently bought a flat in a mansion block in north London, complete with an overgrown garden. Suddenly, I’m that person who watches gardening tutorials on YouTube, invests in fairy lights and visits the garden centre at the weekend. Now I look out of my kitchen window and see lavender, pieris and my favourite blue hydrangea. There’s a huge sense of achievement.”Christine Brown, 59, housing officer“My oldest daughter had lots of allergies as a child, so I’ve always made everything from scratch since then.

We’re playful together he makes me feel young. I often forget I’m in my 40s. Remembering when we met brings me joy – though, actually, I wasn’t interested at first.

This legislation does not stop people losing their homes as a result of coronavirus, just gives them some extra time to pack their bags.”The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the claim that it was rowing back on promises was “absolute nonsense”.A spokesman said: “As soon as legislation is passed, no new possession proceedings will begin – in either the social sector or the private rented sector – for at least the next three months. We have the power to extend this notice period if necessary.”Advice groups called on the government to implement a stronger ban.Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Simply extending notice periods to three months cannot be seen as ‘job done’. It means that people dealing with unimaginable financial uncertainty still face the prospect of being served with an eviction notice.“Over the coming days, the government must keep their promise and add to these changes to make sure no one loses the roof over their head as a result of coronavirus.”Tenants fear they will be left with huge debts, after they lose their jobs, are chased for arrears on rent, and then forced out of their homes with eviction notices.Caitlin Wilkinson, of Generation Rent, said: “This legislation fails to deliver on these promises in every respect. All these measures do is extend the notice period for evictions to three months, which will provide little comfort to those faced with losing their homes in the midst of a pandemic.“Equally worrying is the lack of provision made for rent arrears, which will stack up in the three-month period. Many renters will end up with thousands of pounds worth of debt and no means of paying it off. Landlords and tenants are expected to ‘work together’ to find a solution to suit both parties from June onwards – but there’s absolutely nothing to stop landlords from evicting tenants if they can’t pay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9dbd2dad138d2efc92deb00f90096898cb32d8f/0_479_4100_2461/master/4100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96da78cf0af6ac9ddd6d50cb9fd46e3c","title":"how far do the governments new emergency powers go podcast","story":"A new government bill that brings sweeping new powers to shut down mass gatherings, potentially detain people with coronavirus symptoms and weaken the social care safety net is being rushed through parliament. ’s Peter Walker explains what is at stakeA government bill being fast-tracked through parliament will bring with it sweeping new powers to restrict public gatherings and even detain people who show symptoms of coronavirus.

The jury later found him not guilty of 12 of the charges and said one was not proven, a verdict that also acquits the accused.“It’s pretty clear he intends to sue the Scottish government for damages,” said one ally. “He believes this came from the top.”His allies also believe prominent officials in Sturgeon’s office and the Scottish National party should be fired after text messages and emails came to light that Salmond argues raises serious questions about their role in the case, and their handling of allegations against him.One close friend of Salmond’s said the former SNP leader is also very keen to give evidence to a Holyrood investigation into a botched Scottish government internal inquiry into complaints of misconduct brought against him by two civil servants in 2018.The special committee of inquiry at Holyrood was set up after Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, admitted in January 2019 the internal investigation had the appearance of bias because the official in charge of it had prior contact with the complainants.The alleged assaults against the two civil servants were investigated by Police Scotland detectives and included in the charges levelled against Salmond during his trial. He was acquitted by the jury of both those sexual assaults on Monday.Salmond won his judicial review in January 2019 and in August 2019, the Scottish government paid out £512,000 to cover the legal fees he had incurred.The specially convened Holyrood committee, with includes three former SNP ministers, is due to start hearing witnesses later this year after the coronavirus outbreak has subsided. The Scottish parliament’s sessions have been significantly curtailed by the crisis.In the interim, the committee has asked to be given copies of non-confidential evidence used during the trial so MSPs can study the background papers during the lockdown period and spring recess next month.Before the trial, Salmond’s lawyer, Gordon Jackson QC, presented in closed court details of text messages between senior figures in the Scottish government and SNP, which Salmond argues proves there was orchestration. Joanna Cherry QC, an SNP MP who is one of Salmond’s closest allies, said on Monday: “Some of the evidence which has come to light raises very serious questions over the process that was employed within the Scottish government to investigate the alleged complaints.”Sturgeon told reporters on Monday she was ready to give evidence after the coronavirus crisis was over. “The court has given a verdict, a decision, and that must be respected,” she said.“I have no doubt there will be further discussion around this issue in due course, and I will welcome that, but that time is not now. This country faces a crisis right now, bigger than we’ve ever faced before.”A close ally of Sturgeon’s dismissed claims by Salmond’s supporters that the first minister would be forced to resign due to the controversy. He said there were few MPs or MSPs who believed that was justified.“There are going to be difficulties ahead as we navigate through this,” he said. “Is this going to bring the first minister down? No, it’s not. I don’t see that they’ve got a mechanism to do that. It’s not great, but we will get through this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37360f939b399fd2477f3efb8a23fb8c1497a2e4/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cd8fd7d4dce1d91cd0d5492f876f409","title":"uk app aims to help researchers track spread of coronavirus","story":"Covid Symptom Tracker will also help experts understand who is most at risk of diseaseUK researchers have launched an app to help track the spread of Covid-19 and explore who is most at risk from the disease in an attempt to better understand the pandemic.The free Covid Symptom Tracker app asks users to fill in data including age, sex and postcode as well as questions on existing medical conditions, such as heart disease, asthma and diabetes and whether users take drugs such as immunosuppressants or ibuprofen or use wheelchairs.The app then asks participants to take one minute a day to report on whether they feel healthy and, if not, to answer questions on a wide range of symptoms, from coughs and fever to fatigue, diarrhoea and confusion.The team behind the app – a collaboration between researchers at King’s College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals as well as the health data science company ZOE – hope it will provide real-time information on how the disease is spreading in the UK, including hotspots.“Speaking to clinicians in the hospital, especially in the elderly you get very different symptoms to the young so this idea there is only two types of symptoms – fever and long-term cough – is wrong. It can occur in many different ways,” he added.Spector said the app would shed light both on symptoms and the geographical spread of the disease.“The immediate thing is we will get known clusters of disease at different levels of severity all over the country and we will know what is going on,” he said.While the app is available to the general public, the team has also asked 5,000 twins and their families across the UK – who are already part of a wider research project – to use the app. Should these participants show signs of Covid-19, they will be sent a kit so that they can be tested for the disease.With the twins already having shared a large array of data with the team, from their genetic information to the makeup of their gut microbes, the researchers say they hope the work may help to shed light on why only some people become infected, and why some develop more severe symptoms than others.“What we will be able to do is, very fast, work out whether genes play a role or not, because we just compare the identical and the non-identical twins – we can do that in a few days,” said Spector.“The speed of what we are trying to do here is important – we put this whole project together in five days which would normally take about five months,” he added, noting there is no NHS equivalent. “If we got a million people reporting every day, that is an amazing tool for the epidemiologists.” In South Korea an app developed by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety allows those placed under quarantine to report their symptoms. The app also makes use of GPS tracking to alert both users and officials to see if quarantined iniduals stray outside their permitted zone – a move apparently designed to help reduce super-spreading events."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672a37ae6fead972f74e5b1f02da491713f3aa91/0_79_3196_1917/master/3196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e75aaba84c41c641c4e8d09f93b5e576","title":"coronavirus benefits sick pay and lost hours your rights in the uk","story":"Most UK support has focused on employees and those who are ill with Covid-19The coronavirus crisis has shut down many workplaces in the UK and forced the government to make major changes to the benefits system to support those who are unable to work.The self-employed have been told that they can expect more help, but most of the announcements have focused on employees and on anyone who is unable to work because they have the virus.Depending on which category you are in, here are your rights as things stand currently.Some employers have told workers that they will pay them as usual, at least for the next few weeks. If you are in that position and you do not usually receive any benefits, then you will not need to make a claim.The money has not yet been paid to companies – the Treasury has said it will be paid out “within weeks”. The payments will last up to three months and will be backdated to 1 March 2020.The maximum payment will be £2,500 a month.This is worth up to £29 a day but typically the payment is limited to only five days in any three-month period. At the moment no change to this has been announced.The pay pledge is designed to stop people losing their jobs. By covering their pay, the government hopes that firms will keep positions open so that eventually as many people as possible can return to work.If your employer has chosen to make you redundant despite this, there are rules that they need to meet – they cannot ignore your usual rights.The company may have its own policy which is more generous than the statutory minimum. If it does not have its own policy and you have worked for your current employer for at least two years you should be entitled to:• Half a week’s pay for each full year you were under 22.• One week’s pay for each full year you were 22 or older, but under 41.• One and half week’s pay for each full year you were 41 or older.You can calculate how much you are entitled to here.The chancellor has said he is working on pay measures for the self-employed but these have not yet been announced.In measures announced so far, Sunak has said that he will delay the date at which self-assessment tax payments are due. If you were due to pay a second instalment by 31 July you will not have to do so until January 2021.He has also removed the minimum income floor for universal credit claims – this should increase what you are entitled to. The standard allowance for a single universal credit claimant aged 25 or over is usually £317.82 a month but it is being increased to £409.89, and there are other elements you may be entitled to.Couples can claim more if your partner is still earning that will affect how much you can claim.You can apply online here.You should be eligible for sick pay. If you are an employee, your employer may have a scheme that is more generous than that offered by the government. If it does, it should pay you that.Otherwise you will be entitled to statutory sick pay. The payment is worth £94.25 a week and is paid for up to 28 weeks.The rules have also been changed so that statutory sick pay can be claimed from day one rather than day four as previously.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Many countries are now enforcing or recommending curfews or lockdowns. Check with your local authorities for up-to-date information about the situation in your area.\u0026nbspIn the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should\u0026nbspstay at home for at least 7 days.If you live with other people,\u0026nbspthey should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.If you are self-employed you cannot claim statutory sick pay but you can claim universal credit worth the same each week.You can get the isolation note that you need to show your employer or make a claim here.Employees are entitled to time off to look after dependants in an emergency – this includes a partner or parent as well as children.The time off is unlimited but employers are not obliged to pay you for this. Speak to your employer to find out its policy. If it does not pay, it may agree to let you use holiday or rearrange your working day to limit the financial impact.You can use the mortgage payment holiday scheme announced by the chancellor to stop your payments for three months and give yourself some breathing space.Lenders have been told that they must not charge fees for this, but there will be an additional cost over the term of your mortgage as interest will be building on the money you haven’t paid off.Your lender should outline the financial implications if you decide to take up the mortgage holiday. You need to contact them directly. Phone queues are very long but some are offering the service online so check your bank or building society’s website.Lenders have been told that they must not repossess anyone now.If you do not already claim a benefit and you are losing your job, you will be able to claim for support for housing as part of a universal credit application.There have also been moves to prevent landlords from evicting tenants, although these just prevent eviction for three months rather than the usual two.Speak to your landlord if you are having problems. Buy-to-let landlords have the option of taking a payment holiday and passing it on. It will cost them more for their mortgage in the long term, but they may be willing to accept that extra cost or negotiate a way to share it.The sums available through universal credit standard allowance and the basic element of working tax credit are both being increased by £1,040 a year for 12 months.Local councils have been given a £500m hardship fund so that they can help vulnerable households by reducing council tax for those who receive local council tax support.To find out what your circumstances make you eligible for, use one of the benefits calculators offered by charities.

To go so hard in preparing for the Olympic Games only to be told weeks out that it would be postponed would be so much worse.“And whereas at the start of the month a six-week suspension in sporting events seemed a long time, now it is completely foreseeable for us to think that nothing will be on for the rest of the year. So my approach will be about a change of focus – about staying healthy, and making the right decisions to keep the people around me healthy.”Peaty, who was expected to win 100m breaststroke gold again in Tokyo, said the IOC had made the only decision it could. “As an athlete, I am obviously extremely disappointed but this is more important and bigger than me or any of the athletes that would have been taking part,” he added. “This is a matter of life or death and we all need to do the right thing.”Johnson-Thompson, the heptathlon world champion, concurred, writing: “Waited eight years for this, what’s another one in the grand scheme of things? As an athlete, it’s heartbreaking news about the Olympics being postponed until 2021, but it’s for all the right reasons and the safety of everyone! Stay indoors!”Responding to the news, the BOA’s chief executive, Andy Anson, said: “It is with profound sadness that we accept the postponement, but in all consciousness it is the only decision we can support, in light of the devastating impact Covid-19 is having on our nation, our communities and our families.”Meanwhile UK Sport insisted that it would discuss ways to support Olympic and Paralympic athletes following the delay. “Given the unprecedented global challenge we face, today’s news means that athletes, their coaches and support staff can now fully focus on what really matters at this terribly difficult time, keeping themselves and their families safe,” its chief executive, Sally Munday, added.Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, said his organisation would be willing to move its world championships, scheduled for Oregon in August 2021, to make way for the Olympics next year. “The decision the IOC has taken is absolutely the right one,” he added. “You can’t have athletes locked in their houses, not able to train or use public facilities, then clearly the integrity of the competition was going to disappear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/677be74461bb85d5c4968e5beb5229609dbaa586/77_121_2679_1606/master/2679.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b2af408909cdea0ca5e16bbca3c92d0","title":"johanna konta dwelling on uncertain future with olympics delay","story":"Tennis, already frozen in the sunshine, took another hit on Tuesday – along with the rest of sport – when the Tokyo Olympics were postponed, and Johanna Konta is feeling the chill more than some.The British No 1 is no more than “hopeful” about Wimbledon, which is due to start on 29 June, shortly before the now delayed Olympics.Konta, still working through rehab on a knee injury that has slowed her progress for more than a year, said: “Even just a few weeks ago, who knew we would be in this situation, constantly changing – and changing rapidly? Everyone is hopeful that the constant change could bring us a change for the better as well.”That, at least, was her agenda linked to the recent past, when Indian Wells was cancelled a month ago and the European clay season then put on hold. Konta has to dwell now on the inconvenient present and an uncertain future. She carries on in isolation – protecting against coronavirus, of course, but also in the absence of the backup normally available for elite players with injury.“I got back from the US about 10 days ago. I have some equipment at home so I am able to train, but it’s by no means ideal. I am trying to make the best of the situation. This is not ideal for the knee. I don’t have access to the equipment that I specifically need: team, physio, fitness trainer, the best method to get the kind of stimulus that we want for the body and the knee. But I’m not getting too stressed over it.”Until Monday, Konta was visiting the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton but the facility has closed in line with government guidelines on isolation. “I can’t bring what I need into the flat. I need a leg-press machine. That specific knee exercise, I can’t do right now. In this country, athletes still have access to our respective training grounds, as long as the necessary precautions are observed. But the goalposts are moving.”As for Wimbledon, she said: “I think more than anything it’s important to be hopeful. Nothing wrong with being hopeful. For me, it’s about not looking too far ahead we don’t know how it is going to develop. Now we know we are not playing until the beginning of June, that’s the date we are working towards. When that changes, if it changes, we react to whatever comes next.”Meanwhile she and her photographer partner, Jackson Wade, are holed up in their London flat as Konta keeps in touch with her parents in Eastbourne, and she is desperate to see them once travel restrictions are lifted. She is baking a chocolate chip banana loaf – which she’d like to share, but can’t – and trying to keep her dog, Bono, from upsetting her 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.“The next few months could be quite long,” she says with a smile. “Who knows?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d84d8fee9fd4ec256e73e1efcc4458b2247db9a/0_52_4415_2649/master/4415.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6d13927cd02911d75784d6375172847","title":"olympic postponement inevitable but finding right way to do it caused delay","story":"The inside story of how it went from ‘no plan B’ to postponement in little more than a week – yet with hopes of eventual resurrectionIt sounds preposterous in hindsight, especially now the Tokyo Olympics has joined the ranks of the sporting postponements, but barely a fortnight ago organisers could still see a rickety route towards hosting the Games in 2020.Japan and China appeared to be over the worst of the coronavirus epidemic, so the thinking went, and most of Europe was still open. So a decision was made: to push on, to wait, to hope.That hope continued to flicker, even as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, major sports shut down, and more countries entered lockdown. The Olympic flame was lit on a still March morning in Olympia, Greece and Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, insisted there was “no plan B”. But on 17 March, there was a subtle, almost imperceptible, shift missed by almost everyone.Speaking after chatting to G7 leaders, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, said: “I want to hold the Olympics and Paralympics perfectly, as proof that the human race will conquer coronavirus, and I gained support for that from the G7 leaders.”To most people that sounded innocuous. But in the IOC and elsewhere, ears started to tingle. It was not what Abe had said. Rather, it was what he had not. For the first time, Japan’s leader did not mention hosting the Games in July 2020.From that moment on the decision to postpone the Games was inevitable, according to multiple conversations with those inside the Olympic movement about how the world’s greatest sporting event came to be put back a year. The big question now was when – and how – it would happen.But it appears it was actually the Japanese who were the most reluctant to move the Games – while Bach was actively if quietly pushing for a postponement for some time. The problem was that the IOC could not move unless it got the Tokyo organisers on board. And that, to put it mildly, was not straightforward.The greatest difficulty was that the Japanese could not be seen to lose face. Another was that organisers were keen on holding the Games in October, while Bach felt it had to be 2021 because there was no guarantee that the Covid-19 virus would be under control by the autumn. A third problem was that Tokyo wanted a four-week deadline to work through the issues – something the IOC reluctantly granted on Sunday.But that did not stop Bach stealthily putting the wheels in motion to bring the deadline forward. It was not a coincidence that the Australian Olympic Committee was one of the first to call for the Games to be moved to 2021. The AOC’s president, John Coates, is a close friend of Bach – and chair of the IOC’s coordination commission for Tokyo. Bach knew he needed more negotiating cards. This was one of his strongest.As Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the IOC who still has close ties to the Olympic movement, explains: “The IOC was both officially and through its back channels clearly applying major pressure to get to a quick decision, because it realised that the delay was damaging to athletes and their preparations.” Payne, who handled the $1bn deal between Chinese group Alibaba and the IOC, adds: “But there was also a lot of political negotiations and delicate diplomacy involved to make sure the Japanese don’t lose face.”That explains why the IOC was happy for Abe to “propose” a delay on Tuesday – which, of course, Bach quickly accepted. How could it not be, given the ever-sharpening criticisms from athletes who questioned why the IOC needed so long to reach a decision. Dina Asher-Smith, the world 200m champion, was particularly blunt: “Does this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training – whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff, and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway?”Meanwhile, Dai Greene, the former 400m hurdles world champion, said he was having to flip tractor tyres on his partner’s farm and use bales of hay for box jumps because gyms were shut. “On Saturday morning, I went to recce the local 400m track by one of the private schools near where I live,” he added. “I even had a look at the fence and wondered to myself – can I jump over it?”Greene was lucky. With Britain in lockdown, most athletes could barely train at all. understands the British Olympic Association also took a strong position in talks with the IOC last week. While offering its support for hosting the Games in July, it came with a heavy caveat: if British athletes were unable to train because of the Covid-19 outbreak, the BOA would publicly call for the Games to be postponed.The BOA also increasingly felt that morally there was no way it could take a team to the Olympics in the midst of a pandemic. How, as one source put it, could they justify taking team doctors away from a national health crisis? Especially when its chief medical officer, Niall Elliott, was on the front line in Scotland?It would almost certainly be easier to try again in July next year. World Athletics has already indicated that it will be happy to shift its 2021 championships, which are due to take place in Eugene, to 2022, and Fina, the organisers of the 2021 swimming world championships in Japan in July, has indicated it too could reschedule.Of course there will still be major headaches – not least ensuring that venues can be freed up for whenever the Games take place. As Sebastian Coe, who ran the London 2012 Games and now heads World Athletics, put it after the IOC’s announcement: “There is no project management that challenges a city or country like the Olympics does,” and the cost to organisers from the delay is expected to be at least £2bn.Some of the headaches, however, may not be as great as assumed. The IOC will still get millions in broadcasting and sponsor revenues so long as the event takes place, much of which it will pass on to the sports movement. And while there has been some ill-informed speculation about whether a new athletes’ village will have to be built, that is not a major concern given the 5,500 apartments in the village sold on to private owners for use after the Games do not have to be delivered to them until 2023 – and, as yet, only 500 have been sold. Meanwhile, among those in the Olympic movement there is a hope that the Tokyo Games in 2021 will become a joyous celebration of humanity and harmony after the devastation of coronavirus – much like the Salt Lake City Winter Games in 2002 helped America heal after September 11.“The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times, and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present,” the IOC said in a statement.Such pronouncements usually sound trite. But, in these dark and uncertain times, it struck pretty much the perfect note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b10390c870cc7be55d7121729ba02cbde505b2d0/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fd1daad0509cf5eba15fef0a97d96c2","title":"talking horses pm leo varadkar calls halt to racing in ireland","story":"The country’s attempt to host one meeting per day behind closed doors turned out to be a shortlived oneIreland’s attempt to continue racing behind closed doors during the coronavirus crisis came to an abrupt end on Tuesday when Leo Varadkar, the country’s prime minister, announced that all sporting events would be cancelled from Wednesday as part of further measures to control the spread of the virus. The country’s betting shops will also be closed.Ireland had staged one meeting each day behind closed doors since Friday after Horse Racing Ireland (HRI), which administers the sport both north and south of the border, decided last week to continue racing with strict measures in place to ensure physical distancing.The Irish Flat season on turf got under way at Naas on Monday but the latest restriction, which is due to be in place until 19 April, will mean the cancellation of both the Irish Lincolnshire on the Flat this weekend and the Irish Grand National meeting at Fairyhouse over the Easter weekend on 12 and 13 April. Prospects for the five-day Punchestown Festival, the climax to the Irish jumping season which is due to open on 28 April, also seem increasingly bleak.Ireland had been the only major racing nation in Europe still staging meetings after the BHA decided to suspend the British programme until at least 1 May last Tuesday. France, which had raced behind closed doors from early March, suspended all meetings until mid-April a day earlier.South Africa, which had also been staging regular meetings behind closed doors in recent days, also announced on Tuesday that racing in the country will end from Friday for at least three weeks.“Everyone has to do their job,” Gordon Elliott, the trainer of dual Grand National winner Tiger Roll, said on Tuesday. “If we get back after a month, it won’t be the end of the world.

In her dressing room, she talks about the pain of theatre, acting in English and #MeTooIn 2005, days before my 17th birthday, I saw Isabelle Huppert in Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler at the Odéon theatre in Paris. It felt like being let in on a secret: I lived in a small town, and Huppert stood for the artistic life I imagined was available only to Parisians. Not only was she the first A-list actor I’d ever seen on stage, but she was the most fearless woman I could remember. In a diary entry at the time, I described her – admiringly – as “witch-like”.Fifteen years later, back at the Odéon, she is equally imposing, one-on-one. We met on a grey February morning, before the coronavirus crisis shut down the venue and closed the French capital. Huppert was in rehearsal for Ivo van Hove’s new production of Tennessee Williams’s The Glass Menagerie: the run was cut short after a week of performances, and a scheduled transfer to London’s Barbican in June remains in doubt.The French star was gearing up to play Amanda Wingfield, an ageing southern belle with a quicksilver temperament, who hopes to find a suitor for her frail daughter Laura. On paper, the role is right up her alley: few actors have so consistently sought out difficult, neurotic characters. Unlike many of her peers, Huppert has never seemed interested in being conventionally likable. It is part of her aura, and outside France, it would make her a prime candidate for flying the #MeToo flag within the film industry. Yet the day before Roman Polanski’s triumph at the Césars, the country’s equivalent of the Oscars, when I ask her about gender inequality in her profession, Huppert gets up and briskly shows me the door.Things had started well enough. Sitting in her dressing room, Huppert – often described as a guarded interviewee – is practically animated when discussing Tennessee Williams and her first collaboration with Van Hove, one of the world’s most in-demand stage directors. “Things fall into place without us realising it,” Huppert says of his directing style. “He doesn’t tell me much, but I like it that way.”Later, when I sit in on a rehearsal for The Glass Menagerie, I see Huppert’s vast experience in action. Even when she snaps her fingers repeatedly to get help with her lines from an assistant, she acts through it, the hesitation hardly registering on her face. Not that gearing up for a stage run is a walk in the park, she says. “At this point, there isn’t really any pleasure, just immense fatigue and fear. Theatre is really like climbing a very painful mountain. Of course, once you reach the summit, the view is beautiful. By comparison, cinema is just a nice, effortless stroll.”Huppert has made her mark as an eclectic screen presence, as comfortable in period costumes as she is in the French auteur world and in boundary-pushing international projects. If you grew up in France from the 1970s onwards, chances are you feel like you’ve always known her. Some remember her in Bertrand Blier’s Les Valseuses, the 1974 film that made her famous, or as Claude Goretta’s introverted Lacemaker. To me, she was Flaubert’s Madame Bovary (Claude Chabrol cast her in the role in 1991) and, above all, the repressed, masochistic Erika Kohut in Michael Haneke’s The Piano Teacher.It’s not unusual for her to have up to four or five feature films released in a given year. When she played herself on Call My Agent!, a French comedy series about a fictional talent agency with a roster of real-life stars, the joke was that Huppert was a workaholic who shot one film by day and another by night.When I ask how true to life that frantic schedule was, Huppert equivocates with a clipped laugh. In 2019, she appeared in films by Eva Ionesco and Anne Fontaine as well as in Ira Sachs’s Frankie, which garnered mixed reviews at Cannes and is due to be released later this year. Huppert plays a terminally ill French actor who takes her extended family on holiday in Portugal, and the film capitalised on her ability to flit between different languages (here, French and English). “You’re always a little different when you’re not acting in your mother tongue,” she says. “You’re kind of a stranger to yourself. It’s sometimes limiting, but it can also give you more freedom.”Huppert has also acted in Italian and in Russian, and for her next film, Jean-Paul Salomé’s Mama Weed, she spent a few months learning Arabic. In this adaptation of an award-winning French novel by Hannelore Cayre, The Godmother, a translator for the justice system becomes involved in a drug deal to provide for her ageing mother and children.While Mama Weed’s release, initially scheduled for late March, will have to wait, the trailer drew some criticism on social media because Huppert’s character, as part of her Breaking Bad-style transformation, takes to wearing a headscarf and pretends to be of Arab descent. Still, it’s in keeping with the spirit of The Godmother, which highlights the race and class bias in French drug cases: in the book, her character is able to bamboozle police investigators because they don’t speak Arabic and won’t suspect a white woman.Regardless of the language at hand, you can trust Huppert to do Huppert. “I don’t conform. The way I act is my own, still,” she chuckles. Listening to her, it feels a little as if she is ready to jump into a role at any time. She might as well have been in character as Frankie’s film star when we meet: that day, a photographer was following her for a magazine spread, and on the way to her dressing room, up to the stairs and down a corridor, Huppert had paused our convoy every few metres to make time for a shot, with unapologetic confidence.Surely, I think naively, Huppert is uniquely well-positioned to talk about women’s experiences in the French film industry without fear of retribution. When I ask what her reaction was to Harvey Weinstein’s recent conviction, she lets out an extended “Ah,” and tenses up.“Well, listen … It’s the course of events … I think I had the same reaction as everyone else. A reaction obviously of sympathy for the victims, of course.”I soldier on: “Do you agree to some extent with Adèle Haenel, who told the New York Times that France ‘missed the boat’ on #MeToo?”And with that, the interview is over. In a matter of seconds, Huppert is on her feet and walks away from me, manifestly irked. “Listen, here, now I have to work.” Dumbfounded, I follow her towards the door. “It’s not that I don’t want to talk, but I’m tired, I need to go work.”Before leaving, I pause for one factual question. Did she really sign an open letter, published in the French newspaper Libération in February, in support of Yorgos Loukos, a ballet director dismissed for discrimination against a pregnant dancer? Prominent signatories later denied agreeing to its terms. She gives me the kind of withering look usually reserved for her onscreen foes before answering: “Yes, I signed it, there.”The next night, Roman Polanski was named best director at the César awards. Haenel walked out of the auditorium in outrage, followed by a handful of others. (Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old in the US but fled before sentencing. He was later accused of sexual assault by several women he denies all of the claims.) The César moment exposed a deep ambivalence in the French arts world about #MeToo, especially among Huppert’s generation. Far from Hollywood’s public displays of unity, in 2018, Catherine Deneuve and others have defended men’s “right to pester”. On prime-time TV after the Césars ceremony, Huppert merely offered a quote she credited to William Faulkner: “Lynching is a form of pornography.”At the same time, I thought about my teenage self, who saw a different kind of heroine in the French star. To be clear, Huppert owes her, and the predominantly young women who have led the #MeToo push in France, nothing. She has worked with far more female directors than most of her peers, and has said in the past that “men are not afraid of women the way women are afraid of men”.Yet a moment from the rehearsal of The Glass Menagerie I witnessed stubbornly came to mind. When Amanda learns that Laura’s potential suitor, Jim, is actually engaged to another woman, she bids him farewell with this line: “I wish you luck – and happiness – and success.” If pauses could kill, the glacial chill that Huppert sent through the room after the word “luck” would have been it. Imagine if she channelled all of her boldness and status into speaking out against power abuse. It might be another mountain to climb, but I wouldn’t bet against her."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/574701249551a586ae0e5527a5b742ba52775b82/960_372_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1f473296bb7b38a046fd257fe694409","title":"terrence mcnally a life in pictures","story":"Playwright Terrence McNally was a four-time Tony award winner whose works include Kiss of the Spider Woman and Frankie and Johnny at the Claire de Lune"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71d20b05f7502215e0057e08765c15c2c14cff2/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91fac71b4d7a256d09937f6d3c64f2bc","title":"destination to revisit in future win 200 pounds sawdays stay coronavirus readers tips travel","story":"Tell us about a destination full of memories for you – that you’d love to return to once the Covid-19 crisis is overFirst of all, many apologies to readers who contributed to last week’s assignment on wildlife reserves, but we’ve had to postpone its publication given the Covid-19 crisis and government warnings on social distancing and travel.

Experts reveal what’s out there, where to look – and how to get competitive about it• Share your sightings in the commentsI saw the falcon – a peregrine or a hobby? – gliding high, silhouetted against the glare of a late summer afternoon. Behind me, small birds chattered obliviously in their favoured thicket. The falcon dipped and disappeared. I wondered where it had gone, then sensed a movement where no movement should be and, suddenly, for a fraction of a second, I was face to face with a hobby at full throttle – hurtling at the unsuspecting sparrows behind me. There was a rush of disturbed air against my ear and I caught the ferocious intent in its yellow eyes and it was past me, rearing up over the shrub and ing beyond it as a dozen small birds scattered.This didn’t take place in an RSPB reserve or on a moor. It was right in front of my house in Catford, south-east London, as I cycled back from Tesco, and was a reminder that genuinely exciting wildlife drama can happen right on your doorstep.This is what seasoned birdwatchers and the mildly curious will be clinging on to as the nation shuts down over the coming weeks. After all, yoga on Zoom isn’t for everybody.Some of us have always scrutinised the skies above our homes and gardens but the Covid-19 crisis has turned this activity into something of a movement, sparked by Matteo Toller of Udine in north-east Italy who recently set up #BWKM0 (birdwatching at zero km) on Twitter to help people record their sightings, share knowledge and show solidarity during the country’s lockdown. Matteo himself recorded 51 species from his windows in 12 hours earlier this month, including brambling, black stork, goshawk and the first house martins migrating north.London’s David Lindo, AKA the Urban Birder, is currently quarantined in Spain from where he is tweeting sightings from a rooftop in Mérida and hosting live birding streams on Facebook. David’s enthusiasm is undimmed by his confinement: “The sky is a great arena, anything can fly past and, at the very least, it will give you peace. My message is simple: keep looking up,” he tells viewers on day eight of his vigil.Expert birder Steve Gale’s personal garden list in a Surrey-London suburb extends to 92 species and includes spoonbill and honey buzzards. “That’s phenomenal,” I tell him, astonished.“It isn’t phenomenal,” he says. “It’s just that most birdwatchers don’t systematically observe birds at home. If you start learning the calls and how bird movements relate to flight lines, which use local landmarks, such as rivers and railways and habitats, you can quickly start adding to your list.”Steve’s blog, North Downs and Beyond, based around his “uber patch” where suburbs meet farms and woods, is a treasure trove of flora and fauna observations and a virtual meeting place for likeminded people from all over the country.He too has responded to the Covid-19 threat with a gently competitive birding challenge, inviting people to record sightings from their windows.He advises that the coming month, when many birds are on the wing for thousands of miles, is one of the best to start studying your “patch”, whether you have a garden or just a neighbouring tree and area of sky to study. This is because migration times are when birders expect to see most activity. Birds on the move can often be seen overhead and sometimes even stop by for a rest or meal in your garden or street, he says.“We once had a black redstart turn up in late March that stayed a week in our garden. It found food and hung around for a rest. They come from North Africa or southern Europe at the end of winter.” And, within the next week or two, swallows, house martins and swifts will begin to arrive from sub-Saharan Africa the latter will make urban skies a little noisier – and their screeching calls will be easier to hear as the whine of jets has almost vanished.The same goes for autumn, says Steve, who is also a bird-counting specialist. “There are days when my suburban garden can be better for observing migrating thrush than famous RSPB reserves. I’ve had 4,000 redwing pass over on days when Dungeness has had barely 20.”April is also a great time for wader passage, by night and day. Steve has heard relatively rare birds – such as bar-tailed godwit and whimbrel – passing overhead on journeys to and from the north of Scotland and the Arctic Circle. Why they’ve chosen to fly over the London suburbs as opposed to sticking to the coasts is unknown.“People are starting to buy microphones to use at night to hear calls. They are finding out a lot of new things about what flies at night … sea ducks like common scoter cuts across land we’ve now found.“What this quarantinesuppression of movement can do is to make people realise there is so much more to see at home. But it can be difficult – sometimes nothing happens, you’ve got to be prepared for that,” says Steve.I telephone Dave Woods, a birder who lives in one of the large Medway towns. I’m shocked when he tells me that he and his family have had mild symptoms of Covid-19 over the past week. I ask him whether he is well enough to take an interest in garden sightings (he’s built up a list of 77 species). He says: “No, absolutely not.” He pauses: “Though I did open a window yesterday for a puff of fresh air and heard my first blackcap this spring.”Among his favourite records was a brambling that decided his garden was a good place to build up strength before setting off for its summer breeding grounds in Scandinavia or Russia.He advises observers to keep a keen watch in severe weather: “In response to storms, unexpected birds can turn up in gardens or fly over urban areas as they try to reorientate … even gannets may be seen over inland gardens after bad conditions at sea. And particularly in north-easterly winds, clusters of waxwings sometimes show up in gardens, car parks and petrol stations where they’ll eat hawthorn, cotoneaster and pyracantha berries and any fruit left on trees, particularly when berries aren’t plentiful back home in their Nordic, Russian and Baltic breeding grounds.”My encounter with the hobby last summer may seem a moment of great luck but the sighting was typical of the wildlife drama playing out all around us all the time. As the Urban Birder said, “the sky is an arena”. And so our watch begins."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1778e1227a928538a7dd59a8954ea4e3441180ba/0_338_5129_3079/master/5129.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51e2d78a3879c86dab9e68d9b920421e","title":"democrats woman vice president joe biden running mate","story":"As Biden says he will pick a female running mate, experts say having a woman on the Democratic ticket will move the US closer to the first female presidentHours after the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren ended her presidential campaign and all but assured the next American president would be a white man in his 70s, a group of influential Democratic women gathered for dinner at a Spanish restaurant in downtown Washington.The timing was coincidental, but it underscored the urgency of their meeting.More than a hundred years after American women earned the right to vote four years after the first female presidential nominee of a major party won the popular vote by 3 million votes and two years after the election of the most female congressional class in history, six erse women had entered the 2020 Democratic race and didn’t win a single nominating contest.“Without a doubt, the secret to Democratic victories in the past three years has been women’s leadership. The idea that that wouldn’t translate into the first woman president was heartbreaking for many of us,” said Heather McGhee, a distinguished senior fellow at the thinktank Demos, who supported Warren and helped organize the meeting. Emotions still raw, the group of women decided to do something about it.Over tapas, they drew up a list of demands for the party’s next nominee: he would choose a female running mate women would represent the “governing majority” of a Democratic administration appointments would reflect “the ersity of our communities” and economic issues focused on issues such as paid family leave would be a priority in the first 100 days.They compiled the principles into a letter that was signed by dozens of prominent party activists and leaders and sent to the Democratic National Committee.Days later, at the 11th Democratic presidential debate, the first without a female candidate on stage, Joe Biden explicitly committed to picking a woman as vice-president.“There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow,” said Biden, who holds a nearly unassailable lead over his rival, the Vermont socialist senator Bernie Sanders. He also committed to nominating the first African American woman to the supreme court, a gesture that reflects his reliance on the support of black women, a crucial Democratic constituency.Electing a woman as vice-president would be historic. Only two women have ever been chosen as running mates: the Alaska governor Sarah Palin in 2008 and the New York congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro in 1984. Neither served in the White House.Far from being a “consolation prize”, McGhee hopes that putting a woman on the ticket will move the country closer to electing the first female president. She envisions an empowered lieutenant in the “Dick Cheney mold – but with very different values”.“This isn’t just ticking a box,” she said. “This is opening a door that has been closed for too long.”Biden’s pledge was widely embraced by Democrats eager to elevate a qualified woman to the second-highest office in the land.But it was also a stark acknowledgment that a party increasingly led by women rejected a historic field of female leaders.Biden and Sanders, the last men standing, “don’t look the way the party looks”, said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on women in politics. “They don’t even look the way the primary field looked.”Committing to putting a woman on the ticket directly addresses the “concern among some women that this party continues to marginalize women at the highest levels of leadership”, said Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics. “This is among the least they could do to demonstrate their commitment to gender equality.”But Biden’s commitment to limiting the prospective pool of candidates by half did not draw universal praise. In some conservative and progressive corners, he was accused by women of “tokenism” and prioritizing inclusion over achievement.But researchers say reflecting ersity does not sacrifice quality. Studies have found that women often have more relevant experience than their male counterparts when they run for office.“We have more women who are qualified to be vice-president now than we ever have before,” Lawless said.There are strong political arguments for choosing a female running mate. The 2016 presidential election brought the widest gender gap in a half-century of polling and since then, women’s rage has fueled Democratic victories in every corner of the country. They have led protests, launched political organizations, run for office and voted for Democrats in record numbers. And it is women, far more than men, who most viscerally disapprove of Trump and his policies.While research suggests running mates do little to persuade undecided voters, putting a woman on the ticket could help generate enthusiasm among Democrats . It could also help draw a contrast with Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women.Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders and signed the letter, said Biden should consider his choice of running mate as an olive branch to progressives.“If the next nominee wants our time and our energy, they have to be willing to negotiate the platform, the policies, the transition and what the future of the Democratic party looks like,” she said. For her part, Clinton said recently she would “love” to have a woman on the ticket, but said the nominee must consider the electoral implications: “What will help him win the electoral college?”His former rivals, particularly Senators Kamala Harris, Warren and Amy Klobuchar, are seen as top contenders. As far back as last November, Biden floated four possible running mates and all were women, including Stacey Abrams, who ran for governor of Georgia in 2018 and Sally Yates, the former acting attorney general fired by Trump after refusing to defend his administration’s travel ban.While the vice-presidency is a priority, it’s not the only one of many ways the next nominee must demonstrate his commitment to women’s economic and political empowerment, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants and another organizer of the meeting.“It’s about being committed to hearing women, to actively listening to women, to lifting up the voices of women and recognizing that women are great leaders,” she said. “We’re making those demands but we’re also not sitting back and waiting for those demands to be met.”In many ways, Biden’s pledge reflects the dueling impulses of a Democratic party that prides itself on ersity and inclusion but remains deeply scarred by its loss to Donald Trump in 2016.Early enthusiasm over the record number of barrier-breaking women and candidates of color in the race did not translate into support as the conversation gave way to concerns about electability.On the campaign trail, voters who believed sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton’s defeat feared that nominating another woman would deliver the same result. Many Democrats urged the male frontrunners to pick a female running mate, sometimes suggesting candidates like Klobuchar and Harris before they had exited the race.“Voters were so afraid to recreate anything that looked or felt like 2016 and that created a unique disadvantage for female candidates who wanted to take on Trump,” Meredith Kelly, who was a top aide to the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s presidential campaign.During a debate, Klobuchar said it was obvious that the women on stage were “held to a higher standard” than their male counterparts. Their mistakes, it seemed, were punished more harshly by a party that demonstrated a willingness to rally behind men whose success defied political odds.Biden, who is running on his decades of experience, was first elected to the Senate in 1972, at 29. He has previously lost two presidential elections, and placed fourth and fifth in the first two nominating contests. Sanders fought his way back into contention after a heart attack. Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, parlayed national media attention into a first-place finish in the Iowa caucuses.“Women have to bring the receipts while men get judged by their potential for greatness,” Kelly said. “That was extremely apparent in this presidential race.”There is no evidence to suggest that a woman would lose to Trump. After all, more Americans voted for Clinton than Trump. The women running attempted to address the issue of electability head-on, but the doubts persisted until last week, when the path for nominating a woman officially closed with the departure of the long-shot Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.“These were pretty remarkable women who were accomplished, who could raise money, who had national profiles and who were leaders in their own right,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, another organizer of the dinner. “So we have to ask: is there some misogyny, is there some sexism that serves as a barrier to women running for president?”The degree to which gender played a role in 2020 will be debated for a long time. Warren herself hadn’t fully grappled with the question when she was asked about it moments after announcing she was ending her campaign.“Gender in this race?” Warren said, addressing reporters outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She described it as a “trap question” that forces female candidates to either acknowledge sexism and sound like a “whiner” or dismiss it and deny the experiences of “about a bazillion women” who would ask: “What planet do you live on?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4f32d8900f9fee142a9b0a05b1fb49735150d9d/0_302_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=236131e96309656f76c20ab7907f7993","title":"coronavirus the guardians promise to our readers","story":"Together we can find a way through this crisis, providing accurate and insightful reporting and listening to you, our readersThank you very much for your commitment to the .

Well, it certainly looks different from the skies. I live on the steepest hill in south London, a hill so steep that in pre-coronavirus times it would draw swarms of angry bankers on £4k touring bikes, clinging to its spine like thirsty wasps around a lime tree.On day one of London lockdown the hill is empty, the city below unnaturally silent. From here you can see the London Eye, St Paul’s Cathedral, the grey outline of Muswell Hill to the north and the full range of postmodern skyscrapers in between. You can hear the hum of London’s traffic and the twin flightpaths of Heathrow and City airports.Not today, though. Rarely can six million people have been this quiet on a Tuesday morning. From up here, London has entered standby mode. But look a little closer and the body is still breathing, the streets humming with an insubordinate inner life.On Lordship Lane, East Dulwich, people are walking three abreast, carrying out essential trips to the deli and the cheese shop. Builders are refitting shop fronts. Essential group-jogging is taking place. Insanely – and how insane that this should seem insane – the chip shop with the tables is open for business.Closer to town, people are playing football in Ruskin Park, on Denmark Hill. Demob-happy kids are strolling in groups on the Old Kent Road. In Camberwell, it’s like a moderately busy rush hour – not just for the NHS staff thronging dutifully into Kings College hospital, but for the people milling about the shops or crowding by the park entrance, people those same staff may soon be asked to treat.This is not, by any stretch of the word, a lockdown. Not much has been locked. Nobody seems that down. The plague laws may be back on the streets, dusted off after 500 years on the shelf. But London still doesn’t seem to have really noticed.Perhaps there is still a degree of shock at just how rapid the journey here has been. Thirteen days ago, 55,000 people, 3,000 of them from Madrid, were watching football in Liverpool. Three days ago, people were still thronging the restaurants and pubs.Even now, on lockdown Day Zero, East Street market is rammed with shoppers drawn to the fish and fruit stalls. People have to eat but there is not much distancing here.On nearby Walworth Road, a building has collapsed and police and fire engines are present, along with a curious, milling crowd of people who have just popped out for a fag and a chat, the two south London must-haves of bronchial virus season.At times like these it is hard to avoid the disaster movie images, the deja vu of virus flick montages, even those tempting wartime parallels. In his poem MCMXIV, Philip Larkin wrote about the queues of eager, smiling young volunteers signing up to fight in the first world war, a happy, prosperous crowd “grinning as if it were all an August Bank Holiday lark”.The theme of Larkin’s poem was innocence lost. This feels more like a failure of communication, like the most dysfunctional, libertarian version of lockdown and like something entirely inadequate for a city of this scale.It was not like this everywhere. ’s photographs from around the UK on Tuesday show mounted police patrolling a ghostly South Bank on the Thames. Glasgow Central station is deserted. Small-town streets across the country show evidence of civic-minded abandonment. The motorways in particular are frightening places, empty arteries dotted with the odd worried-looking car.But big cities, or at least the parts people live in, are an uncontrolled environment at the best of times.This needs a more ruthless kind of micromanagement. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested under the current definition 1.1 million Londoners count as key workers (now including people such as bicycle mechanics as well as nurses and heart surgeons).The other eight million Londoners still need to go shopping. Meanwhile, the details of the shutdown are hazy on such a huge scale. London is thronged with fast food shacks, chicken cottages, kebab houses, pizza gaffs. Entire rows of these are now shut, and people really are going to have to get used to cooking.But the hardware shops are still spilling out on the pavement. You can still buy homeopathic remedies from the health shop. Dog walking gets a pass, which makes owning a dog suddenly an A-list accessory, key to trebling your personal freedom at a stroke.As for going shopping “for necessities”: define necessity, which could mean anything from a perfectly foamed cortado to five tins of spam in the trolley, to a reliable, safe supply of crack cocaine and heroin.In the supermarket on Coldharbour Lane in Brixton, south London a middle-aged cashier is keeping order as furtive human shapes grab things from the shelves. The entrance is full of street people, drinkers, people with nowhere else to go. An unsteady-looking man in a long overcoat has already chased the security guard to the back of the shop. “Don’t be upset, darling,” the cashier says in a warm, churchy kind of voice. “Now you’re going to have to stand back. Yes, back. Thank you, darling.”This is not simply operating a till and stacking shelves. Social care is happening here. The cashier says her daughter is at home with her grandmother. Today, she’s finally been allowed to download TikTok. As they leave the shop, people thank her for coming in to work. It feels like they’re thanking her for something else, for sounding like someone is at least in control.The class ide is also working in lockdown. In Dulwich Park, the proscribed single form of exercise appears to be buggy-pushing shuttle sprints or immaculately turned-out middle-aged power jogs. In Burgess Park, between Camberwell and Bermondsey, it’s gathering round a bench lifting a cold purple tin and occasionally shouting at each other.These are Londoners too. Where are they supposed to go? Where are kids who don’t want to be at home supposed to go, or people who just have a shared room, or a shared space with someone they try to avoid?Day one felt like a light-touch London lockdown. The edges will undoubtedly tighten. As in other cities, this is a staged process. It will need to be, if there is any hope of flattening that infernal curve, the curve nobody really knew about two weeks ago but which is now the subject of fevered digital expertise.London has a deep, buried history of plague laws, of wardens wandering the streets, of crosses on doors and houses shuttered and bolted. This is surely coming again in some form. Although exactly how this restless, tightly packed, defiantly distracted place will cope with the key being turned is anyone’s guess."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/039ad58736106cfe93048d7e604d01f869efa202/0_395_3967_2381/master/3967.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c8b81445f0f27b424cf7ea14de8c65e","title":"arts council england promises 160m to buoy public during lockdown","story":"Funding announced to protect arts bodies and freelancers as coronavirus hits revenuesA £160m emergency response package is to be made available to help cultural organisations, freelancers and inidual artists survive the coronavirus crisis, Arts Council England has said.The money is intended to prevent artists and arts organisations from going bust, but is also designed to help them come up with creative responses “to buoy the public” during the lockdown.The package breaks down as £20m of funds for creative practitioners and freelancers, £50m for organisations not in the national portfolio, and £90m for the 828 organisations in the national portfolio, a category that ranges from small touring theatres to the National Theatre.The money is coming from a combination of ACE’s emergency reserves and a suspension of national lottery project grants, normally a vital source of income for smaller organisations and iniduals.The ACE chair, Sir Nicholas Serota, said he had been “deeply moved” by the response of artists and cultural organisations to the crisis, praising “their imagination and invention, but also their generosity and their care for one another and their communities”.“None of us can hope to weather this storm alone, but by working together in partnership, I believe we can emerge the stronger, with ideas shared, new ways of working, and new relationships forged at the local, national and even international level.”ACE said that the financial crisis for the arts caused by the mass closure of venues and cancelled contracts was acute, with evidence showing it was “causing massive and unsustainable loss of revenues”.It said the emergency package was designed to complement the financial measures already announced by the government to help the wider economy.ACE also announced it was delaying the next investment process for organisations who receive regular core funding. The process for 2022-26 was due to begin in the autumn. Instead the current portfolio will be rolled over for an extra year to 2023.In nuts and bolts terms, the package means:• Artists and creative practitioners will be eligible for cash grants of up to £2,500 from the £20m pot. ACE is also planning to make grants of up to £4m to existing benevolent funds for cultural workers.• Organisations outside the national portfolio will be able to apply for grants up to £35,000 from the £50m fund. It is aimed at helping them “to get back on their feet” or to make work in the future, which will mean they can contribute to the “Let’s Create” strategy.• The £90m programme for portfolio organisations includes advancing current grants by up to six months to help with cashflow. The stringent conditions that normally apply to funding will be relaxed.ACE said it regretted suspending national lottery grants. “At this time of crisis, we believe that this budget is best spent on sustaining the sector. We will prioritise reopening this stream of funding as early as possible.”Darren Henley, the chief executive of ACE, said: “Right now, our number one priority is to do everything we can to help inidual artists and cultural organisations to stay afloat. It’s going to be tough, but we need them to be in the best possible shape to use their creativity to benefit people’s lives in villages, towns and cities across England once our communities begin the process of recovering from this terrible virus.“Already, I’ve seen artists and cultural organisations draw on their bottomless ingenuity and creativity to dream up ways to connect, comfort and uplift us as we face these uniquely challenging circumstances.“This is a frightening time for all of us. But, as we distance ourselves from one another in our daily lives, I believe the role of arts and culture in helping to bring us all together will become ever more critical.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

A Greek man, recently returned from Thailand, was diagnosed with the virus on Monday, reinforcing fears of an outbreak in camps seen as especially high-risk environments .MEPs fear that if the virus spreads it could become a public health emergency in the squalid camps, where thousands live in unsanitary conditions, often without electricity, heating or running water.“Many of those in the camps are already in precarious health situations due to the bad conditions in which they have lived for a long time,” states the letter from Juan Fernando López Aguilar, a Spanish socialist MEP, who chairs the committee. “There is no chance of isolation or social distancing, nor is it possible to ensure appropriate hygienic conditions,” he wrote.The letter adds that only six intensive care beds are available on Lesbos for residents and asylum seekers. The notorious Moria camp on Lesbos houses nearly 20,000 people in a space designed for 2,200.“If the EU fails to take immediate action, the situation on the Greek islands will become unmanageable with the risk of many deaths. This is an emergency and the EU has to react accordingly,” the letter states.The MEPs want people over 60 with existing health conditions evacuated first, but do not spell out whether they should go to other EU member states or the Greek mainland.The European commission said it was working with Greece on an emergency response plan to deal with a potential outbreak of coronavirus on the islands. A commission spokesperson said Greek authorities were taking action to prevent the spread of the disease, with compulsory temperature testing of new arrivals to the camps, suspension of visits, regular cleaning of communal areas, and the setting up of quarantine and recovery areas.The spokesperson also referred to an ongoing push to encourage EU member states to give a home to unaccompanied children on the Greek islands. Seven countries pledged earlier this month to take in 1,600 children from the islands.Growing restrictions on everyday life across Europe raise questions about how quickly relocation can happen.Greece went into nationwide lockdown on Monday, limiting residents to their homes for all but essential journeys.A few days before the lockdown began, Ylva Johansson, EU commissioner for home affairs, told journalists that Greek authorities were carrying out age assessments on asylum seekers in order to begin relocation of children.She also said asylum procedures in many EU member states were slowing down. “Many member states have put asylum processes on hold because they don’t want to do face-to-face meetings and then there are no interviews with asylum seekers. Some member states are beginning to do that on Skype instead, but this brings some delay into the system.”Restrictions on travel from Europe are also slowing the return of people whose asylum claims have been rejected, to their country of origin. “This is not really a problem yet, but there are a lot of cases that we know are on hold and that could cause problems in the long run,” Johansson said.Human rights groups have urged Athens to take action. In a joint statement on Tuesday , 21 groups said: “Extremely limited access to running water, toilets, and showers, as well as hours-long lines for food distribution and insufficient medical and nursing personnel, make it impossible to abide by the guidelines for protection from the coronavirus, putting people at significantly heightened risk in the face of the growing threat of widespread Covid-19 transmission.”Speaking to the  last week, the Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis expressed hope that around 5,000 migrants would help ease the pressure by “taking up” the EU’s “generous offer”, but acknowledged it was just the tip of the iceberg. The scheme to relocate up to 1,600 unaccompanied minors to other member states wasn’t expected to be in place until May, he said.As an emergency step, authorities have placed all of the migrant camps on lockdown since March 16, banning visitors, including aid agencies, from entering them. The measure was enforced a week before similar restrictions came into effect nationwide.Earlier this month, some 450 people, who arrived on the outposts after March 1st- when Greece closed its borders to asylum seekers following Turkey’s threat to “open the gates to Europe” - were moved in a tank landing vessel to detention centres on the mainland. Athens’ migration minister Notis Mitarachis said authorities had deliberately kept the new arrivals away from the camps to reduce the risk of an outbreak. But he conceded that it is only a matter of time before the virus reached the camps. “It is a given that there will be cases,” he told Sunday’s Eleftheros Typos newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df29ca634df2b38d06884781beeb49b76cabde1d/0_0_2697_1619/master/2697.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eeee0cb8efeaae1bae1864c2b42913fd","title":"greta thunberg says its extremely likely she has had coronavirus","story":"Activist says she self isolated and warns young people to take the outbreak seriouslyGreta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the global school climate strikes, says it is “extremely likely” she has had the Covid-19 virus.A few days later she said they both began to feel ill, and she complained of feeling tired with “shivers, sore throat and cough”.Thunberg said she had not been tested for the virus, in line with the policy in Sweden, and was now “basically recovered”.But she issued an urgent warning to other young people to take the virus seriously – even if they themselves were often only facing mild symptoms.“We who do not belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.”The school strike movement has propelled millions of young people on to the streets in countries on every continent to demand urgent action to avoid widespread breakdown.

By comparison, just 70,000 people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK, with 6,650 confirmed cases of the disease. Neighbouring Belarus has an infection rate that is three times higher per capita.Sobyanin’s remarks made him the first senior Russian official to publicly contradict the official tally and directly urge greater action from the Russian president in response to the outbreak. He called for prophylactic measures to be taken by the heads of all of Russia’s regions, including the extension of a self-isolation regime for elderly Russians considered most at-risk from the disease.He also saidthat Russia’s healthcare system could be overwhelmed if it was not prepared for a rise in patients, and urged greater testing throughout the country.“No one in the world knows the real picture,” Sobyanin said.The Kremlin has largely presented the situation with the disease as under control, with top officials including Putin telling the public that the greatest danger was panic. But Tuesday marked a change in the government’s rhetoric, with Putin suddenly donning a yellow protective suit and respirator to tour the capital’s main hospital for coronavirus patients.Earlier on Tuesday, a woman died at the hospital in Kommunarka. Doctors claimed she had not been ill with coronavirus, and had died because of complications from cancer.

Production by  Matt FidlerFrom the south London streets of Southwark, Crouch End in the north, and around the City and West End, to Ramsbottom in Greater Manchester, the Forth Bridge and central Glasgow, the story was a similiar one. An eerily beautiful sunny day, quiet on the streets, with people not really sure how to pass the time.The day started with images on social media of busy underground trains as the reduced service resulted in a familiar crowding of the carriages, but this was not a normal day in the capital. Non-essential shops were closed, but the list of key workers is long, and London appeared overwhelmingly quiet on the deserted streets of Waterloo that David Levene photographed early in the day.Jill Mead discovered her local street market was busy in Southwark. The combination of spring weather, worries about supplies and unease about the government lockdown made for a strange atmosphere.Graeme Robertson found people observing physical distancing rules in the parks of north London in Highgate, masks and hats in Crouch End – and stillness on the quiet suburban streets of Archway.Sean Smith found a rather deserted square mile area, with a lone Domino’s Pizza delivery rider, before heading to the West End, where he came across the last performance artist working in Leicester Square – and met a tourist who had just arrived from Mexico and was trying to get to Germany.A woman taking the sunshine on a balcony, an ambulance passing through the streets – these were the sights of Ramsbottom in Manchester, where Christopher Thomond spent the day.Murdo MacLeod found the rush-hour traffic much thinner than the usual gridlock after the government’s lockdown in response to the coronavirus outbreak.The city centre of Glasgow was quiet, with shops and cafes all closed – and the railway station was deserted.Ryan Bowman is the proprietor of Mezcal Mexican restaurant. After being forced to close the premises, he decided to put the perishable food to good use, by donating it to NHS staff and hospital workers.

It also announced that New Zealanders returning from overseas would now be quarantined in airport hotels or motels if they did not have anywhere to self-isolate in the city they arrived in.New Zealand has a relatively low number of infections – with 205 confirmed or probable cases – and no deaths. But Ardern emphasised when she spoke to parliament and reporters on Wednesday that the strict new measures were necessary to save lives.“I am fully aware that we have moved with huge speed,” she said. “No other country in the world has moved to these measures with no deaths and so few infections. But we have no time to waste.”Officials have scrambled to decide which businesses would count as “essential” and which would be forced to close after plans for the heightened alert were announced on Monday. The list of essential businesses, which includes supermarkets, corner shops, pharmacies, and medical providers, is stricter than those issued in Australia and the UK, and bars “big-box” stores, takeaway delivery services such as Uber Eats, and those packing online orders other than groceries, from operating.“We could have waited to plan every intricate detail required to execute this closure, till we could answer every single question or circumstance,” Ardern said on Wednesday. “But, every hour we wait, is one more person, two more people, three more people, exposed to Covid-19. That is why we did not wait.”She added that the restrictions would be enforced: “And we will be the enforcer.”“You may not be at work, but that doesn’t mean you don’t have a job,” she said. “Your job is to save lives, and you can do that by staying home, and breaking the chain.”Officials warned that the police would be deployed to deal with those flouting the rules, and could detain them if necessary. Earlier at a news conference, Sarah Stuart-Black, a civil defence leader, did not rule out engaging the military for the task. The new state of emergency powers allow authorities to requisition food and fuel and close roads if necessary.It is New Zealand’s second-ever national state of emergency the first followed the devastating Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011.Ardern warned that the worst was “yet to come”, as confirmed Covid-19 cases were expected to continue rising into the quarantine period. That was because those infected before it began would begin showing symptoms over the next fortnight.“But over time, we will see change if we all stick to the rules,” she said.New Zealanders would be permitted to leave the house for “fresh air” as well as to buy groceries or seek medical help, but Stuart-Black warned that this did not entail “just going out for a bit of a mooch”.Ardern reinforced the rule, adding that playgrounds were off-limits and those out for walks should not stop, speak to anyone, or touch anything.The government also announced it would ban rent increases for the next six months, and allow more leniency for tenants who were not able to pay due to the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21321cadb8faaf514d45a5ea36af3aa4252a4be8/379_546_3723_2234/master/3723.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aed76aef71e602695654c34b20de5cd","title":"coronavirus advice from mexicos president live life as usual","story":"López Obrador’s apparent nonchalance in response to pandemic draws barrage of criticismFrom a bountiful table filled with culinary delights from Oaxaca, Mexico’s president offered unusual advice for a country facing the coronavirus crunch: keep dining out.“We’re going to keep living life as usual,” a relaxed Andrés Manuel López Obrador insisted in an online video shot during a weekend tour of the southern Mexican state.“I’ll tell you when not to go out any longer,” the left-wing populist said, explaining that the pandemic was still only in its first phase.“If you’re able and have the means to do so, continue taking your family out to eat … because that strengthens the economy.”López Obrador, who most know as Amlo, has responded to the coronavirus crisis with nonchalance – never missing an opportunity to contradict the advice of public health officials or paint the pandemic as a plot to derail his presidency.In recent weeks Amlo has routinely avoided social distancing and organised campaign-style rallies rife with gladhanding, hugs and baby-kissing.Amlo has also resisted ratcheting up measures to slow the virus – such as calling off mass events until recently or closing schools and businesses – arguing that doing so would unnecessarily harm the vast swaths of the population economically unable to isolate themselves for several weeks or months.Even his attempts at promoting social distancing seemed petulant. Last week he tweeted a video of a young girl with braided hair lauding his presidential agenda – “we’re with you and your great national project”, she said – to which Amlo replied: “I wanted to smother her with kisses, but couldn’t because of social distancing.”Amlo’s supporters, meanwhile, speak of coronavirus in almost conspiratorial terms. One person at a recent morning press conference called it “a fad disease” in his question to Mexico’s leader.Amlo’s behaviour has sparked a barrage of criticism from Mexicans – many of whom are taking precautions on their own without government guidance.“López’s arrogance in the face of the global coronavirus crisis is frankly irresponsible and reprehensible ... his reluctance to use hand sanitizer is simply immoral,” the journalist Luis Cárdenas wrote in El Universal newspaper, calling Amlo Mexico’s “worst president in history”.He is also drawing unflattering comparisons to other populists such as the US president, Donald Trump, who has downplayed the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic, and Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the crisis as a media “trick” and a “fantasy”.This week the left-wing American magazine Mother Jones branded Amlo “the most irresponsible president on the continent” and said his weak response compared badly with those of other Latin American governments such as Colombia and El Salvador.Analysts said Amlo’s apathetic response stems partly from concerns over Mexico’s economy – and partly from his conviction that his political foes are behind calls for him to take more drastic action.The political scientist Aldo Muñoz Armenta said Amlo’s attitude was one of “they can’t tell me what’s correct because they’re the ones that want to hurt me”.“It’s now turned into an issue of competition and not a matter of public health,” said Muñoz, a professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico State. “Amlo is more interested in contradicting them than making a decision.”Others believe that Amlo – who swept to power in 2018 vowing to champion Mexico’s poor – fears taking measures that are too tough, too soon could damage his political standing by causing economic chaos.When Amlo’s predecessor, Felipe Calderón shut down Mexico City for five days in 2009 to combat the H1N1 viral outbreak, Amlo criticised the move as excessive. Analysts said Amlo wanted to avoid repeating Calderón’s example – even though it was lauded by international health officials.“The perception that Calderón overreacted is still prevalent among Amlo supporters,” said Rodolfo Soriano-Núñez, a sociologist in Mexico City.Xavier Tello, a Mexican healthcare analyst, said: “He could genuinely be trying to save the economy for the poor. But he is allowing them to become infected and contagious, which will be worse for them in terms of the health costs.”“He’s being as irresponsible as a head of state can be,” Tello added.On Tuesday Mexico – which has so far reported 367 confirmed cases of coronavirus and four deaths – announced it would suspend all public and private gatherings for the next month in an attempt to halt the disease’s spread."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c3503426875ecac8614c1ddb0a46742","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance march 25","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:There are currently more than 423,000 cases of coronavirus confirmed around the world with 18,916 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. It says 108,578 patients have recovered from the disease. There was another strong rise in cases in the United States where more than 55,000 people have contracted the virus. Thailand also saw cases rise sharply with 107 new infections, bringing total to 934, a health official said on Wednesday.After several days of legislative wrangling, the US Senate leaders have agreed on a $2 trillion stimulus package with the White House. Democrats had been holding out for more help for the healthcare sector and states but party leaders declared a deal had been reached at 1am local time on Wednesday morning. Asian stock markets responded positively to the prospect of the help for US industry but futures trading points to a more subdued response on Wall Street. Earlier, US president Donald Trump said he wanted to open parts of the country “by Easter” despite the advice of experts to keep lockdowns in place and restrict the spread of the virus. Nouriel Roubini, the respected economist who foresaw the last financial crisis, says the world is seeing the fastest, deepest economic shock in history.Li Keqiang, China’s second most powerful leader, has told local governments not to cover up new cases of coronavirus as the apparent elimination of the threat of disease prompted the relaxation of travel restrictions in Hubei, the former epicentre of the outbreak. Li urged officials to report figures honestly and “not cover up reports for the sake of keeping new case numbers at zero”, according to Caixin Global. His comments came as Chinese health officials reported a fall in imported infections fell and zero locally transmitted infections.India’s population of more than 1.3 billion people has woken to the first day of a three-week lockdown designed to save the country from being overrun by the coronavirus. Narendra Modi, the prime minister, told Indians that he was banning people from leaving their homes in order “to save India, and every Indian citizen, to save you, and save your family”. Modi warned that if these next 21 days were not managed properly then the country’s development risked being set back 21 years. India has 562 cases and 11 deaths so far.Doctors in Australia have been told not to prescribe the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the similar compound chloroquine after some physicians gave it to themselves and their family members despite potentially deadly side-effects.The communist New People’s Army said on Wednesday they would observe a ceasefire in compliance with the UN chief’s call for a global halt in armed clashes during the coronavirus pandemic.The country of 5 million, which has more than 200 cases of coronavirus, heads into a national lockdown tonight for at least four weeks. Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, called on every citizen to ‘act like you have Covid-19’ and warned that those violating compulsory stay-at-home rules would face “no tolerance”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/961bb6241712125a6d9788d7f3cf14b28bf51e71/0_31_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d9f49e9f4b1a47cda20d5fcd0890f84","title":"coronavirus nature is sending us a message says un environment chief","story":"Exclusive: Destruction of wildlife and the climate crisis is hurting humanity, with Covid-19 a ‘clear warning shot’, say expertsNature is sending us a message with the coronavirus pandemic and the ongoing climate crisis, according to the UN’s environment chief, Inger Andersen.Andersen said humanity was placing too many pressures on the natural world with damaging consequences, and warned that failing to take care of the planet meant not taking care of ourselves.Leading scientists also said the Covid-19 outbreak was a “clear warning shot”, given that far more deadly diseases existed in wildlife, and that today’s civilisation was “playing with fire”. They said it was almost always human behaviour that caused diseases to spill over into humans.To prevent further outbreaks, the experts said, both global heating and the destruction of the natural world for farming, mining and housing have to end, as both drive wildlife into contact with people.They also urged authorities to put an end to live animal markets – which they called an “ideal mixing bowl” for disease – and the illegal global animal trade.Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme, said the immediate priority was to protect people from the coronavirus and prevent its spread. “But our long-term response must tackle habitat and bioersity loss,” she added.“Our continued erosion of wild spaces has brought us uncomfortably close to animals and plants that harbour diseases that can jump to humans.”“There are too many pressures at the same time on our natural systems and something has to give,” she added. “We are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not. If we don’t take care of nature, we can’t take care of ourselves. And as we hurtle towards a population of 10 billion people on this planet, we need to go into this future armed with nature as our strongest ally.”Human infectious disease outbreaks are rising and in recent years there have been Ebola, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), Rift Valley fever, sudden acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), West Nile virus and Zika virus all cross from animals to humans.“It’s almost always a human behaviour that causes it and there will be more in the future unless we change,” said Cunningham. Markets butchering live wild animals from far and wide are the most obvious example, he said. A market in China is believed to have been the source of Covid-19.China has banned such markets, and Cunningham said this must be permanent. “However, this needs to be done globally. There are wet markets throughout much of sub-Saharan Africa and a lot of other Asian countries too.” The ease of travel in the modern world exacerbates the dangers, he said, adding: “These days, you can be in a central African rainforest one day and in central London the next.”Aaron Bernstein, at the Harvard School of Public Health in the US, said the destruction of natural places drives wildlife to live close to people and that climate change was also forcing animals to move: “That creates an opportunity for pathogens to get into new hosts.”“We’ve had Sars, Mers, Covid-19, HIV. We need to see what nature is trying to tell us here. We need to recognise that we’re playing with fire,” he said.“The separation of health and environmental policy is a ​dangerous delusion. Our health entirely depends on the climate and the other organisms we share the planet with.”The billion-dollar illegal wildlife trade is another part of the problem, said John Scanlon, the former secretary general of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.“Importing countries should create a new legal obligation, supported by criminal sanctions, for an importer of wildlife to prove that it was legally obtained under the source country’s national laws,” he said. “If we can blend taking a hard line against transnational organised wildlife criminals, while also opening up new opportunities for local communities, then we will see bioersity, ecosystems and communities thrive.”The Covid-19 crisis may provide an opportunity for change, but Cunningham is not convinced it will be taken: “I thought things would have changed after Sars, which was a massive wake up call – the biggest economic impact of any emerging disease to that date,” he said.“Everybody was up in arms about it. But it went away, because of our control measures. Then there was a huge sigh of relief and it was back to business as usual. We cannot go back to business as usual.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48474b0dd292449be1ab1aa9c86d33c8fd829f7/0_164_3494_2097/master/3494.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7542d09677912030d129efe6197e377c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they should i call doctor covid 19","story":"What are the symptoms caused by the Covid-19 virus, how does it spread, and should you see a doctor?It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has transferred to humans from animals. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.No. In the UK, the NHS advice is now that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. This applies to everyone, regardless of whether they have travelled abroad.In the UK, you should look on the dedicated coronavirus NHS 111 website for information. If you get worse or your symptoms last longer than seven days, you should call NHS 111. People will no longer be tested for the virus unless they are in hospital.Many countries have imposed travel bans and lockdown conditions in order to try and halt the spread of the virus. You should check with your local authorities for the latest advice on seeking medical assistance.People in the UK will only be allowed to leave their home for the following purposes:Police will have the powers to enforce the rules, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the instruction to stay at home, the government will:Parks will remain open for exercise, but gatherings will be dispersed.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January.As of 25 March, more than 425,000 people have been infected in more than 150 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have been over 18,000 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China, where the coronavirus was first recorded in the city of Wuhan. Italy has been hardest hit, though, with over 6,800 fatalities. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated.More than 108,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba06cadcce1b63ed9a8724b099a2e230bfdc965/0_240_5149_3090/master/5149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=241d29bdc8d4bcd0b17d92641811c8af","title":"massively let down disappointment in japan after tokyo olympics postponed","story":"IOC decision to put off the event a second blow for businesses already reeling from costs of coronavirus pandemicOn Tuesday, the Tokyo 2020 countdown clock showed there were just 122 days to go before the Olympics opening ceremony.By Wednesday morning, the clock, outside the Tokyo station building, simply displayed the current date and time. The switch was so sudden that commuters paused to take photos.Hours after Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, confirmed that the Games would be held “no later than next summer”, some Tokyoites were conflicted about their reaction.Emi Hagino, a media consultant who was born and raised in the capital, said she had initially accepted the delay as inevitable, but then felt “massively let down”, as it would affect her business.“My parents remember watching the 1964 Olympics here, so they have experienced it before, but for me it was going to be a magical once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to actually see the world’s biggest sporting event with my own eyes, with everyone’s focus on my city,” she said. “I can wait for another year, but please, no longer.”Koichi Teratani, who blogs about the city’s Kabukicho entertainment district – a popular destination among Chinese tourists – said the postponement was a second blow for local businesses still reeling from the financial costs inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.“Hotels are already struggling from cancellations, so the smaller ones that don’t have the means to weather the storm face even more uncertainty,” said Teratani, who had just started printing 40,000 copies of a bilingual guidebook to Kabukicho – an area packed with thousands of bars, restaurants and clubs – hand out to visitors during the Olympics when the postponement was announced.“We can hang on to them for another year, even though some of the information might be a bit out of date,” he said.There was disappointment that the spectacle, more than six years in the planning, had been delayed, but relief, too, both that the speculation of recent weeks had ended and, crucially, that Abe and the IOC president, Thomas Bach, had agreed that cancellation was out of the question.“I think the Japanese government and the IOC had no choice but to postpone, because holding the Olympics without athletes from around the word would have run counter to the Olympic Charter,” said Akino Yoshihara, a Kyoto-based translator who had been looking forward to watching track and field events.“It would have been unfair if some athletes had been denied the opportunity to compete because of the coronavirus situation in their countries.”Yujiro Nakao, a Tokyo company employee, agreed that a delay was the only sensible response to the outbreak, but said he had “mixed feelings” about not being able to see athletes who had spent years preparing for the biggest moment of their careers.The first postponement in the Olympics’ 124-year modern history is expected to create a financial headache for the myriad businesses with a financial stake in the Games.The IOC and local organisers will have to renegotiate contracts with official broadcasters and sponsors, and extend rent agreements on venues that, until Tuesday, were to have served their purpose by the time the Paralympics ended in early September.The Nikkei business delay reported on Wednesday that the organising committee estimates that the postponement will raise the total cost for the Games by 300bn yen ($2.7 billion) due to additional labour and other costs. There is no guarantee, either, that the 80,000 volunteers who were due to descend on Tokyo this summer will be available next year.“Obviously, the celebratory mood of the Olympics had already been fading due to the coronavirus,” an official from one of the Games’ sponsors told the newspaper. “Perhaps it would not have been fully welcomed if the Games had gone on as scheduled. We just need to start afresh.”Ami Takada, a recent high school graduate, was among those enjoying the spring sunshine in Tokyo on Wednesday who wondered if a one-year delay would be long enough, given the virus’s seemingly unstoppable onslaught."},{"url":null,"title":"people are so thankful how delivery drivers became the new emergency service","story":"Just a month ago, they were deemed unskilled workers. Now they are essential in the fight to control coronavirus. But what is it like driving down increasingly deserted streets to make sure everyone – including elderly and vulnerable people – has what they need?Last week, Bob (not his real name) clocked in for a shift at Tesco’s 185,000 sq metre (2m sq ft) depot in Livingston, Scotland. He loaded his HGV with 25 tonnes of food, toilet rolls and toiletries, and drove 25 miles to a Tesco supermarket in Musselburgh. The staff waiting to unload his lorry seemed strung out. The store was heaving, they told Bob. Everyone kept buying toilet paper. It was busier than Christmas.Bob chatted with them for a bit – he has worked for Tesco for 20 years, so knows everyone on his routes – then got back into his HGV. He drove the 25 miles back to Livingston, reloaded, and drove 88 miles south to Dumfries. It was the same story there: exhausted staff, empty shelves, customers running amok. “It’s mad,” Bob says. “Normally at this time of year, you’d mostly be delivering Easter eggs.”But these are difficult times, and our couriers and delivery drivers have become the nation’s lifeline. Down emptied motorways they speed, cargo jolting in a refrigerated hum. In ordinary times, many of us scarcely notice the army of workers bringing us our milk, our eggs, our daily bread. Now, we anxiously watch for them.“People are so thankful you’re there,” says Colin Dodd, a 62-year-old driver from Romford, east London. He delivers groceries for one of the big four supermarkets. (He prefers not to say which one.) “You can help them. There’s a different culture among the customers. It’s like we’re all on this war footing.”As the nation hunkers down to ride out the coronavirus pandemic behind closed doors, couriers and delivery drivers bring groceries to elderly people, vulnerable people and those self-isolating or physical distancing. Last week, the food delivery drivers’ critical role in keeping the country fed was recognised when the government added them to the list of the UK’s key workers, alongside doctors, nurses and social workers.On Monday, announcing the UK lockdown, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, encouraged people to do grocery shops online rather than venturing outside. The unprecedented internet traffic after the announcement meant many major supermarket websites crashed. Watching Johnson talk, Dodd wondered how the supermarket delivery networks could possibly manage. “I expect the army may be involved with the logistics of it all,” he says, “because home shopping vans alone cannot cope … we have 20 deliveries in one van. That’s not even going to cover one street.” But he was also stoical and determined. “We want to step up and be major key workers, and save lives.”For many of us, coronavirus panic snuck up gradually, before exploding. But delivery drivers had already seen the signs. “The first thing was the loo roll,” says Brendan (not his real name), a 35-year-old Ocado driver from the south-east. At the beginning of March he delivered 180 rolls of toilet paper to a couple living in a small semi. A week later, he had to lug 120 litres of water to a fourth-floor London flat with no lift. “I try not to judge anyone,” he says, “but it’s harder to keep a smile after the sixth journey up the stairs. You feel it’s excessive.”Paul (also not his real name), a 58-year-old Tesco driver from the Midlands, first noticed things were different when he delivered a van full of tinned goods and bottled water in the first week of March. The woman who bought them seemed edgy, and told Paul she was feeling paranoid. Paul is used to people confiding in him on the doorstep – sometimes when he is unpacking their drinks, customers will confess they are alcoholics. So, this time, he told her cheerily: “Everyone is being paranoid – you’re just the first to admit it to me!” But, of course, he was judging her for ordering more food than she could eat in a year. “God knows what that woman is like now,” he sighs.The day after this, a man opened the front door wearing a gas mask. Signing for his shopping – tins and bottled water – he said to Paul: “You can never be too careful.” Over the next few weeks, the deliveries have steadily got larger and heavier. “All of a sudden, there were tins in everyone’s orders,” Paul says. “Everyone was eating pasta.” As the orders stacked up, the streets emptied out. Paul’s van grew quiet, too. Normally he’d listen to sport on the radio. But all the fixtures had been cancelled.For delivery drivers, things really started going haywire last week. The government announced that schools would be shutting, the country tuned into daily press conferences, and social media users began posting pictures of bare supermarket shelves. The websites for all the major supermarkets started to crash: delivery slots were unavailable until April, if you could get one at all. Ocado took down its app and then, temporarily, its website, citing a “staggering amount of traffic”.“It has been mad,” says Becky Gray (not her real name), a driver from Hertfordshire. She works for the courier company Stuart, which supplies drivers to Ocado’s express Zoom service. After the Ocado website was taken down, Ocado Zoom remained operational, and savvy shoppers moved over. Gray worked from 10.30am until late at night most days last week. “Normally, you go to work and you can get a 15-minute or half-hour break between deliveries,” she says. “This has been one drop after another.”Many workers are worried about what will happen if they become unwell. “They’ve just said: ‘If you get sick, contact us,’” Gray says. She sounds worn out. “We’ve on the frontline, fulfilling their customers’ orders and needs. We’re exposing ourselves to the virus. It would be nice for employers to say: ‘This is what we’re going to do for you if anything happens.’ It’s on the news – stay away from people! But we have to go to their front doors and give them their shopping, and they may not even know they have the virus.” In response, Stuart says the company has created contact-free guidelines for couriers for pickups and drop-offs, and is offering to reimburse up to £20-worth of protective equipment.Coronavirus has aimed a spotlight squarely on the precarious but essential nature of gig economy work. “They aren’t doctors and nurses, but they are on the frontline,” says Jason Moyer-Lee of the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain. “Couriers and drivers are doing some of the most important jobs around right now, with some of the least protections.” Moyer-Lee calls on the government to extend statutory sick pay to self-employed people: at the moment, only employees of companies are eligible, and virtually all delivery drivers and couriers are self-employed.As a result, many delivery drivers and couriers face an impossible choice: self-isolate if they believe they have coronavirus, even if that means not getting paid, or risk passing it on to others. Gray says that she would be tempted to carry on working because she needs the money. Stuart says that since 17 March, it has been compensating couriers who have tested positive with Covid-19 and have official verification provided by the NHS. While Ocado says: “We are taking the highest level of safeguarding measures to protect our colleagues, customers and third-party contractors. This includes the distribution of hand sanitiser, wipes and handwashing provisions for Stuart couriers delivering for Ocado Zoom.”Bob, meanwhile, knows of a driver who got into a confrontation with a store manager last week after the person unloading his van appeared unwell. The sick man had kept working because he was worried he wouldn’t be paid otherwise. Tesco says it offers sick pay from day one for self-isolating staff.For some of those who do try to do the responsible thing, there can be hefty penalties. “I feel as if I’ve been penalised for being responsible,” says the Deliveroo courier Greg Howard, 32, from Nottingham. “They made the decision that I was too unwell to work, but not unwell enough to get paid.” After coming down with a fever and cough, he notified Deliveroo, which suspended his account. He tried to access Deliveroo’s coronavirus hardship fund, but can’t because it requires a doctor’s note – and the NHS is not issuing them. (At present, NHS isolation notes can only be obtained after an inidual has been unable to work for more than seven days because of coronavirus.) Deliveroo says it is “committed to providing financial support for riders across the world who are diagnosed with the virus or who are told by a medical authority to be in isolation. We are providing riders with continuous advice, based on expert guidance on how to stay safe, and we will continue to explore other ways in which riders can be supported.”Like many workers in the gig economy, Howard, who has a newborn baby, doesn’t have savings. His partner is on statutory maternity pay, and money is tight. For the week that he self-isolated, he had no money coming in. “Anyone in the gig economy lives hand-to-mouth,” says Howard. “It’s hard to make enough to live and support yourself, let alone have savings.”Just one month ago, the home secretary, Priti Patel, announced that the UK would be closing its borders to low-skilled workers including delivery drivers and couriers. Now, they are so essential, they are deemed key workers while the rest of us are told to stay home. It’s a remarkable about-turn. “The government has always shown a disregard for low-paid, precarious workers,” says Moyer-Lee. “And now it is saying they’re important enough to be key workers. But we’re still not seeing the policies we need to protect them, their families and the public.”Most supermarkets have, however, introduced safeguards for their drivers, including antibacterial wipes and gel, and guidance for no-contact deliveries to customers who are self-isolating. (Drivers leave the items on their doorstep, then back away.) Brendan has been given more time in between drops to sanitise his hands and wipe down the van with antibacterial wipes.But customers can sabotage this. “Sometimes, people try to grab the shopping from your hands,” Brendan says. “I say: ‘No, I need to put it down, and then you need to pick it up.’ It’s not just about them – I don’t want to get the virus and pass it on to my wife.” Before Tesco changed its guidance, telling drivers not to enter customers’ homes under any circumstances, a few of Paul’s co-workers had been invited in by customers to unpack deliveries. “Halfway through, the person says: ‘Oh, I’m self-isolating because I feel unwell.’ And the driver’s already inside the property,” sighs Paul. “The great British public!”For the delivery drivers on increasingly deserted roads, there is, unsurprisingly, a sense of unease. “The streets are empty,” says Simon (not his real name), a 40-year-old driver for Sainsbury’s, based in Manchester. “Getting around is easier every day. It’s a weird one … there’s almost a sense of paranoia now. I think: ‘Has someone given it to me? Or am I going to give it to someone?’” When customers tell him they think it’s a big fuss over nothing, Simon smiles and nods. “I shut down the interaction as best as I can because I don’t agree with it.”They are also anxious for their customers. Dodd is worried about how some of his regulars, who are elderly or unwell, will cope with so many delivery slots sold out. One of his regulars recently messaged him on social media in a panic. She is disabled and can’t get a delivery slot for weeks. Her food is running out. Dodd plans to drop off food to her in his free time. “I don’t mind helping,” he says. “She’s at risk. I fear for her.”Simon is concerned for the mental health of his elderly regulars who are self-isolating alone. “If I can spare five minutes to talk to an old lady who is lonely I will, even if I have to stand way back on their doorstep,” he says. “You can tell some of these old people are so happy to have someone to chat to sometimes. You worry about how they will feel a few months from now.”Even if you can get a delivery slot, panic-buying has stripped the shelves so much that many online orders are half-unfulfilled. Delivery drivers see the problems this causes first-hand. Dodd delivered to a young mother last week. “She was in a panic,” says Dodd, because all of the baby formula she’d ordered was missing. “I said: ‘I’m sorry, it’s been stripped off the shelves.’ You could see her anxiety level rocket through the roof.” Another elderly customer, who has arthritis and lives alone, found that all the essentials – bread, milk, loo roll – were out of stock. Dodd was so worried about her he gave her his phone number, and told her to call him if she needed help.When you’ve seen vulnerable people go without, the behaviour of the stockpiling hordes stings that much more. “People are being selfish,” says Paul. “We’re not thinking about each other.” When he walks through Tesco to collect his deliveries, the shelves are increasingly bare. “It’s getting silly,” he says. “The government is going to have to step in and say: ‘We’re moving to wartime rationing – we can’t trust the public.’”Brendan hasn’t been able to stop thinking about the couple he delivered all that loo roll to at the beginning of March. At the time, he laughed it off. Now, he feels differently. “Seeing the shortages in the shops, you think: ‘Wow, that’s really selfish.’”In these unprecedented times, it is hard to overstate the importance of drivers and couriers to those most vulnerable to coronavirus or in its grip. But Paul is modest about it. “I got called an essential service last weekend by a customer,” he says, sounding slightly embarrassed. “I walked away and thought: ‘I am, really.’ In all the time I did this job, I never thought I’d be described as a key worker. You just get to people and sort their food out.” Afterwards, he got back into his silent van, and drove to his next stop, past cars unused in driveways and homes with curtains closed.• Some identifying details have been changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dd46df13bc4c11e5b6e24e702a1b9e62df413ac/0_190_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39e832c27b2478b2a47d38d14367d479","title":"people think its magic how one of brazils poorest cities gets its best school results","story":"The children of Sobral have overcome disadvantage to top 5,000 districts.

Could it be because news is almost always grim, focusing on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame?This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theThis is one of the last places anyone would expect would be a paragon of educational excellence. Yet, Sobral has gone through an extraordinary metamorphosis and is now the best place in Brazil to get a state education.This is a stunning turnaround in a country beset by income inequality and poor literacy rates: half of state-educated students are still illiterate by the third grade.So what has been Sobral’s secret to success? The mayor, Ivo Gomes, says: “We have reached this position because this is a 23-year-old project that has surpassed changes in mayors and secretaries of education. People think it’s magic and it’s not. It is persistence and a lot of hard work.”In 1997, the movement to improve education in Sobral began with renovating school buildings and furnishing them with computers and other resources. Public spending on education was boosted.In the past, politicians had commonly rewarded allies by handing out government jobs, including headteacher posts to people who could barely read or write. This practice was stamped out.There was a crackdown on truancy today families are called if their children don’t turn up to school. Newly qualified teachers now undergo a preparatory internship and all teachers, regardless of experience, receive on-the-job training for a day each month. Every term there is a bonus system for teachers whose students perform well in assessments.Student welfare is a high priority pupils receive two free school meals a day and there are plans to hire a mental health professional in each school.All this has led in part to the success of former students such as Chelton Santos, 22, and his sister Maria, 20. The siblings live with their parents and grandmother in a poor and dangerous area. The family have survived on one minimum wage (now $258 a month) for many years.“I grew up seeing gang fights,” said Chelton Santos. “I had to face poverty and violence. My parents took good care of us but we had financial difficulties, and had to take out loans.”Despite a difficult upbringing for the pair, the future is looking bright: Santos is studying law at university and his sister is working as an office clerk to save money to study medicine. They are determined to succeed. Maria says: “My dream is to be a doctor. I’m going to get there. I’ve seen my mother suffer with health problems since I was a child and now I want to help the poorest in society.”Sobral’s success is now being replicated across the country. Clodoveu Arruda, a former mayor of the city, who oversaw a large part of the transformation in the education department, has teamed up with the Lemann Foundation to spread best practice. So far they have worked in 25 municipalities across five states.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe People seeking testing for coronavirus will have to display two major symptoms rather than one before they are referred, following a major change in how those deemed suitable for testing are selected.Patients will have to show fever and at least one sign of respiratory disease - such as cough or shortness of breath - before they can be referred for testing, under a change recommended by the National Public Health Emergency Team.One further death and 204 new confirmed cases have been reported by the NPHET at its daily briefing on Tuesday evening.The deceased patient, a male in the east of the country, had an underlying health condition.This brings to seven the number of deaths from Covid-19 in the Republic, and to 1,329 the number of confirmed cases.Up to now, either fever or cough was considered sufficient for referral, but this led to a massive increase in demand, with 20,000 people a day seeking testing.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said this had led to a lot of inappropriate testing and a focus was needed now on priority groups such as people in hospital or healthcare workers.He admitted public health officials had “cast the net too widely, in good faith” when they loosened the criteria two weeks ago but added they had always said “we won’t get everything right”.The latest change is likely to sharply reduce the number of people referred for testing from the present levels, which Dr Holohan described as unfeasible and unsustainable.BacklogTo date, 17,992 tests have been carried out in laboratories across the country, according to NPHET. Just 6 per cent of samples tested positive.An analysis of cases up to Sunday evening shows 55 per cent are in men and 45 per cent in women. There are 44 clusters involving 243 cases.Some 277 patients (29 per cent) have been hospitalised and, of these, 29 have required admission to ICU.The proportion of cases involving healthcare workers continues to rise, and now stands at 26 per cent (247 cases).The proportion of community transmission cases also continues to rise, and now stands at 47 per cent.Dublin has the highest number of cases at 535 - 55 per cent of all cases - followed by Cork, with 123 cases (13 per cent).Dr Holohan said a number of factors had influenced its recommendations to Government for further restrictions to limit the spread of Covid-19. These included the fact that the number of cases was now over 1,000, an increase in admission to ICU, a number of deaths, the prevalence of community transmission and the number of cases involving healthcare workers.Officials were unable to say how long the backlog for testing - which stood at 40,000 at the weekend - currently is.ShortagesThe average time for processing tests has increased from 10-12 hours last week to 26 hours now as a result of increased demand, according to Dr Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory. The waiting time for processing tests for hospitalised patients was significantly shorter, he said.Swabs of the virus can stay live for seven to 10 days so no samples have expired due to the delays, he added.There were shortages of some parts of the kit used, he said, though testing capacity was being ramped up. In four weeks’ time, it is planned that 15,000 tests a day will be carried out.“When you’re in the middle of a pandemic everyone is pulling on the same supply resource.”The HSE’s current stock of personal protective equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers are “low”, according to HSE chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry. However, it was hoped that a large consignment of masks, gowns and goggles would arrive from China on Sunday.Dr Holohan said it was “very encouraging” that the average number of contacts in confirmed cases had dropped from 20 last week to about five.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211315.1585081231!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nothing off limits in varadkar plan to stem coronavirus","story":"An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced a series of new measures - while also extending current restrictions until April 19th - in an attempt to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the Covid-19 briefing at Government Buildings on Tuesday. Photograph: Steve Humphreys The Government unveiled two major initiatives on Tuesday in the nothing-is-off-limits struggle to tackle the coronavirsus.One is economic, to ameliorate the fallout from the suspension of most commerce in the State, and one is social, applying further restrictions to citizens’ movements in order to retard the spread of the disease. Both are, in any normal context, breathtaking in their reach. The truth is that both may have to be revisited in the weeks and months ahead if the virus hits harder and for longer than the Government hopes.Other parties quickly assented to the package. Politicians, of course, cannot stop being politicians and they are all wondering how this will play out in the medium and the long term Fianna Fáil especially can see how Varadkar is rebuilding his political capital through the crisis and frets about the effectively suspended process of government formation but they also know they can do absolutely nothing about it. A time of crisis is a time for executive action, not Opposition perspectives. The truth is that while the Government naturally wants to keep them all onside, the Opposition will accept more or less anything the Government does. Normal politics, like so much else, is now in abeyance.Desperate times, desperate measures. Like its counterparts across the world, the Irish Government will take on heaps more debt as it seeks to replace some of the income workers have lost, while also trying to keep companies going through wage subsidies.The objective is not just to ease worries and hardship among businesses affected and people who have lost, and will lose, their jobs. The intention is to keep the economy ready to rebound when the crisis eventually comes to an end.Tuesday’s package will cost nearly €4 billion the Government is prepared for another €4 billion if needs be. The total cost of the coronavirus crisis – welfare, wage supports, increased health spending, tax receipts lost – is now rocketing far beyond the €10 billion that Government insiders were estimating only last week.The measures are for three months – until the beginning of the summer. What if the virus continues to rage then? We will do it again for another three months, says one person at the heart of the administration: whatever it takes.But what then? The National Treasury Management Agency has assured the Government that there are “no constraints” on its capacity to borrow money on the markets. But if the crisis is a prolonged one, that will not be true forever. No country can keep ramping up its borrowing indefinitely without the bond markets taking notice.If the crisis doesn’t pass in the coming months, the Government’s ability to throw money at the situation will be diminished, and ultimately exhausted. That is inevitable.The second element of Tuesday’s measures – greater restrictions on social interactions and on commerce – are similarly based on some evidence, but also on hope. Social distancing is working – chief medical officer Tony Holohan said that the average number of close contacts among those with the virus has dropped from 20 to five – but the truth is that neither politicians nor scientists know if it’s working quickly enough. The big surge of cases has yet to hit the hospitals. So all non-essential businesses are now being told to close, and people are being asked to stay indoors, allowed out for vital trips and for exercise. Gardaí will become more muscular with those not observing social distancing in public. The Government abhors the term lockdown, but this is certainly the greatest shutdown of commercial and social life the country has ever seen. The day after the UK government announced a sweeping shutdown – piling political pressure on the Government here to follow – Varadkar and his Ministers haven’t quite gone the full Boris, but it’s pretty close. Within Government there has always been significant concern about the long-term sustainability of a general shutdown. At the same time, it was a stage they knew we were likely to reach. The silent fear many have is that there aren’t many more shots left in the locker.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoWe are stranded in a hostel having both recently lost our jobs\u0026rsquoKerry Mountain Rescue appeals to walkers to stick to lowland paths and routesOther measures include allowing immediate provision of temporary health facilitiesNon-essential elective surgery in private facilities to \u0026lsquogo to back of queue\u0026rsquo during crisisStorage facility \u0026lsquosignificantly below international standards\u0026rsquo, Imma warned officialsAkara Robotics device clinically proven to kill viruses and bacteriaA junior counsel is clad in face mask and gloves ... the first sartorial update since 1685Threshold receives \u0026lsquodozens of calls\u0026rsquo from those told to leave homes by landlordsSenators appeal to electorate to vote and post ballot papers ahead of March 31st deadlinePub scene in city has been brought to standstill by Covid-19Number testing positives jumps by over 200 for second day in a row, while another fatality is recordedBill includes abolition of planning permission for emergency health facilitiesJudge remanded defendants on continuing bail until a date in JuneOne further death and 204 new confirmed cases reported as stocks of protective equipment run \u0026lsquolow\u0026rsquoDevice prompts day-long security alert involving police and bomb disposal expertsChildcare worker remanded on bail after court told jury unable to agree on verdicts on 18 counts of alleged sexual assaultAccident happened just off the N25 Cork to Waterford road204 new cases in State as gatherings restricted to four people and measures extended until April 19thWoman tells family court \u0026lsquoI cannot even walk to the shops\u0026rsquo due to man\u0026rsquos behaviourCabinet is told that increased welfare payments and income support schemes will cost \u0026euro300m per week for 12 weeksStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211376.1585088430!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ban on evictions and rent freeze in new emergency legislation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy. Photograph: Damien Eagers The new emergency legislation published on Tuesday night contains measures to prevent evictions and implement a rent freeze for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.The measures, announced last week, are among a swathe of emergency moves contained in the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Bill 2020, which is expected to pass the Dáil and Seanad by the end of the week. The Bill was approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday. Under a section on how the existing Residential Tenancies Act operates will be changed, it says that the emergency period will be for three months from the legislation taking effect. The moves are supported by all parties and groups in the Dáil. This period, however, may be extended by the Government if deemed necessary. The Bill says a “landlord shall not serve a notice of termination in relation to the tenancy of a dwelling during the emergency period”. It also says that an “an increase in the rent under the tenancy of a dwelling” that would ordinarily take effect during the emergency period “shall not take effect during that period and shall not be payable in respect of any period falling during the emergency period”. Those served with termination notices on their tenancy, but who have yet to leave their rental property, will be “entitled to remain in occupation of the dwelling until the expiration of the emergency period”. In effect, it would mean that if someone has a 90-day notice period, and is 30 days into that period, the new legislation means the notice period would pause for the duration of the emergency. When the crisis ends, such a tenant would have 60 days left on their notice period.The tenant will also be encouraged to get rent supplement from the State if paying rent becomes a problem.Planning changesOther measures proposed by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy and approved by the Cabinet were the abolition of the requirement for planning permission for the construction of emergency health facilities, such as hospitals the removal of the requirement of a change of planning permission for a restaurant to do takeaways, and the pausing of various statutory periods in the planning process. This would be similar to the Christmas period when a pause is placed on planning periods due to public offices being closed.“The measures we are proposing remove planning barriers for temporary medical facilities, allow hard-hit restaurants adapt, protect the supply chain, and preserve the integrity of decision-making and public participation in the planning process,” Mr Murphy said. “We will keep the situation under constant review as this crisis evolves and respond to any emerging issues in the coming weeks and months.”Another change being made will allow retailers receive deliveries and stock their stores from lorries and other vehicles throughout the day and not just at designated times. Local authorities have told Mr Murphy they will not enforce existing rules “given the compelling reasons in the public interest to support the delivery of food and essential supplies at this time”. A Government statement said: “These conditions were designed with normal ‘business as usual’ circumstances in mind and, in the context of the current emergency, cannot be allowed to act as a barrier to the effective operation of supply chains.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4210749.1585041793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plan to bring home irish people stranded in peru awaiting green light from lima","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A Peruvian soldier patrols during the COVID-19 restrictions in Lima, Peru. Photograph: Paolo AguilarEPAThe Government’s plan to bring home 135 Irish people stranded in Peru by the country’s coronavirus lockdown is awaiting the green light from the government in Lima.An email to those stranded sent on Monday morning by the Irish embassy in Chile said the timing of the proposed charter flight out of Lima “will depend on how soon our aircraft can be accommodated by the Peruvian authorities”.Tánaiste Simon Coveney told RTÉ on Sunday an agreement has been reached between British Airways and Aer Lingus to charter a flight from Lima “in the next few days”. As well as Irish nationals dependants who are entitled to live in Ireland can also take the flight.The embassy email also said Irish authorities “will confirm details in due course for bus transfers within Peru from agreed locations to the military airport in Lima”. Only an estimated half of the 135 Irish, most of whom are backpackers, are currently in Lima with local travel restrictions preventing the rest making their own way to the capital.Repatriation will cost each traveller €400 but they will not be required to pay the fare in advance. Anyone diagnosed or showing symptoms of coronavirus, also know as Covid-19, will not be able to travel. At least six people have died of the virus in Peru with another 363 people confirmed infected.‘Not straightforward’Mr Coveney told RTÉ that organising the flight out of Peru “is not straighforward”. France and Israel are among the countries that have already sent planes to bring their nationals home. But thousands of other foreigner are still stranded in one of South America’s most popular tourist destinations.Peru has all but shut its land air and sea frontiers in response to the global pandemic. It announced a strict 15-day stay-in-doors quarantine on March 16th giving foreigners just 24 hours to leave the country. Many were left stranded and have since been reliant on their respective government to come up with a solution to get them out.On Sunday authorities closed fully the international airport in Lima. Now only flights bringing home Peruvian citizens or coming to evacuate foreign nationals can fly into the country and must land at the capital’s military airbase. Travellers stranded at the international airport were forced to make their way to the base in the hope of their governments sending planes to rescue them.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211380.1585118007!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord leo calls a nation to double arms as it faces covid 1916","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA view of a man wearing a mask on O’Connell Bridge in Dublin. Photograph: Tom HonanThe This time with a companion: The Shock. Another Seamus Heaney moment in Government Buildings, although this time without the usual quotation. But when the Taoiseach briefed the country again on the Covid-19 crisis, his theme was very much one of hope and history, and how we must all pull together and make it rhyme. He brought the latest news from the Cabinet table to a country anxious to hear it. With him, a number of key Ministers and Ireland’s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan. They would tell us the Government’s next moves in the “coronavirus emergency”. We don’t know what it was like in homes around the country as the populace awaited this communication, but in the Government press centre, the atmosphere was unusually quiet. For the purposes of social distancing, all the seats had been ripped from the small auditorium and replaced by chairs set at double arms’ length from each other. So the place was full of spaced-out journalists and spaced out Government Ministers. No wonder the mood was calm. Twice in his statement, Leo Varadkar referred to “The Emergency”, with a capital “E”. For the day job, his main speechwriter is a historian in Trinity College. This could also explain the Taoiseach’s rousing invocation of the brave men and women of 1916 as he concluded his address. On day number something of these days when every day is now known as “what day is it today?”, it was time for another word with the people. Would this be a ticking off for slapdash distancing? A dollop of hard medicine for crimes against virology? Was this going to be the dawn of the much anticipated Lockdown Day? It wasn’t. The Taoiseach doesn’t even like the word. It has confusing meanings, he said. It lacks clarity. Maybe, but not if it is implemented to the letter, without creative interpretation. It might happen yet. But the Government and its advisers are not adopting hard tactics in its campaign against the virus. “The Shock” will happen to the economy. This is what Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe called the ferocious buffeting the economy is about to get. But where fighting the pandemic is concerned, it’s all about community co-operation, following the medical expert-based Government guidelines with iron resolve. Make the gradeThis was far more carrot and very little stick from Leo Varadkar and his team as they issued the nation with its latest report card in the early days of this crisis. It was the sort of report most pupils would be more than happy to bring home. “Keep it going – you’re doing great” was the overall assessment. Although, as is always the case, there is room for improvement and greater achievement. It appears that the concerted efforts of people to observe social distancing and temper their behaviour in the sneezing and handwashing department have been working. “Too early to tell for sure but we believe it is making a difference,” said the Taoiseach. And you could almost feel a little tremor of pride and a shiver of hope course through the national veins. “The Irish people have risen, they’ve risen to that challenge . . . we are beginning to see early and encouraging signs . . . Now is the time to do more,” encouraged Simon Harris, whose hair is getting more grey with each passing press conference. Tony Holohan, who seems to be everywhere at every time to such a degree that perhaps he must have been substituted by a Tony Hologram, had encouraging figures to bolster confidence a little. He talked of “intensive, sustained, public health action”.There are restrictions and the Taoiseach rattled through them. There was little surprise in them, except perhaps that they might not have gone far enough. As Jimmy Walsh, a former member of the Dáil press gallery, remarked to us about the universal need for social distancing: “It’s better to be 6ft apart than six feet under.” Better times are yet to come.National causeThe politicians call efforts to stem the tide of coronavirus “the great national effort”.Private hospitals “will operate effectively as public hospitals under section 38 of the Health Act for the duration of the Emergency”, it was decreed. “There can be no room for public versus private when it comes to pandemic,” said the Minister for Health, who also said that now “we can no longer reach out with our hands, we must reach out with our hearts”. Normally, phrases like that would have hardened commentators reaching for the sick bag. Ditto “we need everybody in this country to be a hero”. But these are not normal days. Where do we get measured for our capes?“If we’re being honest it’s all a bit surreal,” admitted Simon. There was information and there were figures from Donohoe and Ministers Regina Doherty and Heather Humphreys, who all seemed on top of their briefs.Leo Varadkar was asked if he had anything to say to reassure people at home who will be afraid.“I think we’re all a little bit afraid and it’s perfectly natural and normal to be a little bit afraid. You know, we can all see what’s happening in Spain, what’s happening in Italy, only two or three hours’ flight from here and that frightens us all.”Contrast his answer with Donald Trump’s when the US president was asked the same question last week. Things may be bad here, but we’re luckier than others.At the end, Varadkar recalled the 1916 commemorations and the men and women they celebrated.“I never believed that we would be called upon to match their courage or their example, but today we are.“We will be tested, but we will succeed. Our greatest generation was not in the past.” Words to bolster a flagging nation, off with renewed vigour to find the pike in the thatch.

The unprecedented move was aimed at keeping the virus from spreading and overwhelming India’s fragile healthcare system as it has done in parts of Europe, where infections are still surging.Everything but essential services like supermarkets were closed. Normally bustling railway stations in New Delhi were deserted and streets that just hours before had been thronged with cars were eerily silent, with just a trickle of pedestrians.

This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4211096.1585071291!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus leading irish medic in us castigates lunatic in charge over delays","story":"March 20th, 2020: US president Donald Trump threw a tantrum over a question on peoples fears of Covid-19 at a White House press briefing. Video: The White House\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tProf Garret FitzGerald: ‘The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.’ Photograph: Eric LukeThe United States is showing every indication it will outstrip China in coronavirus cases, and is already “not far behind them”, according to one of its leading medics Prof Garret FitzGerald.The US is about to experience a surge in cases in a scenario where President Donald Trump delayed taking decisive action, and squandered early advantage he had secured by default, added the University of Pennsylvania professor of pharmacology and therapeutics.Referring to Trump as “the lunatic in charge”, FitzGerald said that by restricting travel from China for largely xenophobic reasons he may have bought time, but subsequent delays on testing and restrictions undermined this. “He continues to send mixed messages,” FitzGerald said.Trump’s failure meant the most effective strategic response came at state level, with key governors dictating necessary pace. FitzGerald cited New York Times analysis showing that awareness was behind in other states, a disparity between red (Republican) and blue (Democrat) states, with the latter scaling up action. “The irony is Trump supporters paid the price for his mistakes.”DeathsHe questioned how many extra deaths would be due to delays and misinformation. The president has continued to describe chloroquine drugs used to treat malaria and other conditions, as “game changers” in the fight against coronavirus, also known as Covid-19, when there was no proper study to show they work, noted FitzGerald, who is originally from Ireland.In response to misleading advice from the French health minister Olivier Véran, FitzGerald has a letter in the latest issue of the research journal Science, highlighting how he wrongly issued a warning on painkillers – notably nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on which he is a global authority.His letter had gone viral through social media channels. “So that is good. It was a silly thing to say at several levels,” he said, “In a sense, it was like Trump’s ignorance of science.”Véran confused matters by claiming on Twitter that anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or cortisone could aggravate coronavirus infection – when people taking NSAIDs for other reasons should not stop doing so for fear of increasing their coronavirus risk.He advised people to take paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead to treat a fever but this only added to confusion, given it is also an NSAID.Flawed advice was being compounded by fake news and irresponsible behaviour, FitzGerald said, citing reports that four young people taking NSAIDs for sports injuries were in ICU in Cork.It added up to “a fusion of unreality” and was a wake-up call for the public on “why pervasive ignorance of science comes at a price. Trump is the ultimate metaphor as far as that is concerned.”Healthcare workers were displaying remarkable dedication and bravery in a similar way to Ireland, while the scientific community had been mobilised on rapid development of vaccines new drugs and apps to monitor and advise people. But there were specific dangers in the US scenario.There were long delays before rigorous separation was implemented. Its health system was fragmented, varying between best healthcare and none. There was rowback on Obamacare in a system where too many had no health insurance and “uneven sick pay”, motivating many people to go work.FitzGerald said there was a lot less social cohesion in the US compared to Ireland but stressed he was outlining a worst-case scenario.He is scaling down research at his facility while helping a national effort to ramp up coronavirus-related research and share vast amounts of data in a harmonised way – all done remotely.This will involve work on hundreds of thousands of patients post-infection, to identify key contributing factors to spread and infection. This had to be done in a safe way not to impair front-line clinical work.As he is in a higher risk age group he will not be on the front line but expected to be “called up” to deal with patients “back from the front line”.He added: “We’re very fortunate. We see what’s coming. We can work remotely, and have sick pay and health insurance. We’re at the elite end of the vulnerability spectrum.”Those most at risk were vast numbers of people with no health insurance – separate to those who were homeless.FitzGerald feared Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US expert on infectious disease who is helping to lead the national response, would be fired by Trump.Republican business interests were pressurising the president to allow people go back to work. “Fauci won’t accept that. We will see.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Politics latest news: Parliament to shut down tonight to slow spread of coronavirusHow do I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer campaign - and what would I do?Can I go to work?

And it means that the measures we do have are likely to be in place for longer to flatten the curve in a way that would prevent a second dangerous peak.Meanwhile, China has announced it will finally be ending lockdown in Wuhan on April 8, a huge milestone for the country and a signal that the crisis - for them at least - is nearing its end. The city in Hubei province was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.Yet it took more than two months of extremely draconian restrictions, including travel bans and quarantine zones, to achieve the level of containment seen in Wuhan. Britain is nowhere near that level of lockdown.And the Chinese restrictions were not lifted for more than 12 weeks after the first death, so if Britain follows a similar path, ours may need to be in place until the end of Mayearly June. Certainly, that is when the Government has said it expects cases to peak and then level out.However, from papers released last week, we know the Government is at least considering restricting movement for the rest of the year.The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, which feeds into the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), proposed that because of the length of the outbreak, parts of the country could be placed in six-month lockdowns at a time, before being allowed more freedom. Prof Rowland Kao, the Sir Timothy O’Shea Professor of Veterinary Epidemiology and Data Science at the University of Edinburgh, said: It must be hoped that such measures will only last a relatively short time.However, we must be prepared for this not to be the case, and for them to be in place for an extended period.The next three weeks until the Prime Minister\u0027s review will be crucial, as the unfolding epidemic will now be seen in real time, rather than through modelling, allowing experts to make more accurate predictions of when it will peak, and finally die away. It is also possible that after three weeks it becomes apparent that the costs to shutting down society far outweigh the benefit of slowing the spread and the government may choose to lift restrictions even before the peak.Prof Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, said: We now enter a phase of careful monitoring. We are looking for indicators first that the epidemic is slowing down and then for numbers of new cases to start to fall. After three weeks we will have to decide whether the restrictions need to be continued, can be relaxed, or can be relaxed temporarily with the expectation of imposing them again later. We must also monitor the damage being that the lockdown is doing damage to the economy, to education, to psychological well-being and to health and social care provision in the community. The impacts of this epidemic are too far reaching for policy decisions to be driven by epidemiology alone.There are also hints that countries in Europe may be on a slightly faster course than China, and may peak sooner, meaning restrictions could be lifted earlier. While cases in China peaked some 72 days after the first recorded infections, public health officials in both Germany and Italy believe that they are starting to see a plateauing now, which could mean a peak of around 57 and 53 days respectively.Earlier this week, the Prime Minister said that we are two weeks behind Italy so Britain may end up peaking by the beginning of April. China left lockdown restrictions in place for nearly a month after the peak, so it is possible restrictions could be lifted early in May.Prof Sheila Bird said that more cases in coming days and weeks would make it easier for the Government to predict how the epidemic is responding to lockdown measures which will inform how long they remain in place. She said: Once an epidemic takes hold, as now in UK, the country’s own data – properly reported and interpreted – take precedence over modelling as the data tell us the actual actual toll which the epidemic is exactingA huge amount can be inferred about the immediately forthcoming weeks from these data directly, including whether further policy changes are needed to reinforce social-distancing, for example in particular age groups.Some experts are still concerned that the current restrictions do not go far enough while others say the government has been hit by an ‘epidemic of action’, and is now bringing in measures that have little rationale. We are still seeing some notion that \u0027the people\u0027 are selfish and must be bullied and disciplined. The people are not selfish: they have behaved in ways that are inidually rational but have collectively irrational results.However Dr Andrea Collins, Senior Clinical Lecturer in Respiratory Medicine at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM), said: I believe that they have not quite gone far enough. The \u0027absolutely\u0027 necessary to go to work is still being used by some when it is not required - I think we need permits across controlled areas to go to a workplace.Recent modelling from the universities of Exeter, Bristol and Warwick suggested that without any measures at all, the epidemic would have peaked around 133 days after first person-to-person transmission in Britain, which happened around February 28. So the lockdown has the potential of curtailing the spread by around seven weeks. A welcome relief for people who could have been facing lockdown for most of the summer.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus qa should going work can refuse","story":"Going to work is one of only four reasons why people can leave their homes under the unprecedented crackdown on freedom of movement unveiled by Boris Johnson on Monday. However, the Prime Minister made clear in his address to the nation from 10 Downing Street that people should not travel to work unless it was absolutely necessary.Allied to this, the Government published a list of businesses which legally had to close due to the threat to public health including all pubs, bars, nightclubs, hotels, cafes, restaurants and workplace canteens apart from takeaways or cafes in hospitals and other institutions. Only supermarkets and other food shops, health shops, chemists including non-dispensing pharmacies, petrol stations, bicycle shops, home and hardware shops, launderettes and dry cleaners, bicycle shops, garages, car rentals, pet shops, corner shops, newsagents, post offices, and banks were allowed to stay open.Any business opening or operating in contravention of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Business Closures) Regulations 2020 will be committing an offence. However, questions remained about whether staff could refuse to work if their employer was on the list of businesses which can remain open and whether staff had to work from home or could be asked to come to their workplace.People should use their common sense in deciding whether they should leave home to go to work. Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, said that the advice is crystal clear - you should stay at home unless you had one of the key reasons to go out: exercise, shopping, for medical need or to do work that work cannot be done at home.The Government wants company managers to think of different ways to encourage staff to do their work by minimising social distancing. Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer, said people should try to practice safe distancing at work if they are required to be in the office, describing it as a commonsense principle. She said: We are encouraging our employers to think really carefully about how they can innovate in the way their staff are working and if they do need to be in the office just to spread people around.A Number 10 spokesman said: “Guidance in relation to anybody who fears that they may have symptoms or anybody in their house might have symptoms - they should remain at home. We need people to stay at home as ultimately that will save lives.The advice from the Government is to raise any concerns about their place of work with managers. Ms Harries said: If people don\u0027t feel safe in their work environment they should always raise those concerns.The majority of employers are being really sensible and supportive and there has been huge support for staff and the population in general. Ms Harries said that the Government could not inidually cover every single scenario whether it is in the workplace or in the family. It is back to applying the principles. If iniduals can work safely they can keep a distance apart.The guidance is silent on whether people can leave home to look for a job. However, a Downing Street source said that people should try to look for a job online rather than head outside. The source said that employers should be flexible wherever possible and be prepared to conduct an interview online, over the phone, or via Skype. The key issue was to adhere to the rule to stay two metres or six feet apart.The Government\u0027s position is that building sites should remain open if workers can stay six feet apart. Fresh guidance was also issued by the Construction Industry Council on Tuesday. Number 10 said on Tuesday that construction sites “should continue where it can happen in a way that follows Public Health England and industry guidance.A statement read: We urge employers to use their common sense when managing live projects and ensuring that employees can follow government guidance and practice safe social distancing on site. However there was some confusion, with Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First minister, telling buildings sites to close. Sadiq Khan, the London Mayor, claimed on Tuesday that he was overruled by the Prime Minister who doesn’t believe that construction workers should be at home when he asked to close sites.Transport for London has cut the number of London Underground trains running through the capital due to staff shortages. However, congestion has been caused by builders heading to work at the same time as health workers and other key workers are heading to work, as well as fewer trains. One idea could be for building sites to start work later to avoid the early morning overcrowding. Number 10 said Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, pressed Mr Khan - who chairs Transport for London - on Tuesday on the issue of “reduced services on the Tube and its impact on people trying to get to work”. Further talks were held on Tuesday between Mr Khan and Grant Shapps, the Transport secretary, to make sure “appropriate timetabling is in place to ensure that it is safe for those who need to get to work because they cannot do this from home”, 10 Downing Street said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/24/TELEMMGLPICT000228461210_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpiVx42joSuAkZ0bE9ijUnGH28ZiNHzwg9svuZLxrn1U.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"dont heed governments advice steps could taken clamp selfishness","story":"Police dispersing a large group in Piccadilly Gardens in Manchester city centreThe word unprecedented is often used to describe the severity of the current crisis we all face.Change has been more rapid than any of us could ever have expected in our lifetime.Police officers are part of the fabric of society and none of us wanted the Prime Minister’s drastic measures to become reality, but difficult choices have had to be made to stop the spread of COVID-19.  This has resulted in unprecedented changes to our laws to address the seriousness of the situation.The nature of policing is changing dramatically. We have left what could be called ‘business as usual’ and are dealing with new laws to help stem the spread of this pandemic.Police officers patrol the streets daily based on consent. The public are the police and the police are the public and rely on the generosity, decency and support of the communities we serve.This relationship cannot be allowed to break down under the strain of this virus.  We all have a moral duty to uphold the rule of law and look out for each other.We’ve seen government stepping up to the mark on a daily basis and tackling COVID-19 head on. Home Secretary Priti Patel has also been particularly supportive. But there is a real threat we are moving towards even more additional emergency powers if people do not heed the advice to stay at home.To avoid this, we require the public to help us and our other emergency service colleagues by listening to the latest advice and adhering to it.Coronavirus UK and regional map ..This will allow police officers to concentrate on keeping the public safe and deal with the response to COVID-19 as best we can.These short-term changes to the freedoms we usually enjoy will save lives and will support the sterling work being done by the NHS during this difficult time, as well as helping my hard working colleagues too.The practicalities of policing a lockdown are enormously challenging. But I can assure you, police officers will tirelessly do all they can to keep the public safe.We never turn our backs on anyone. But because of the scale of the pandemic it will be difficult, so I would urge everyone to help us and follow the government’s advice.I know most of the public will heed the advice and stay at home. But the new legislation will put in place plans to deal with those who do not. We will not tolerate irresponsible and potentially life-threatening behaviour.The Prime Minister’s instructions were a plea for us all to act and to help each other. While the police service will play its part, iniduals need to self-police themselves, their friends and family.My colleagues will certainly be involved when there are groups of people behaving irresponsibly. This will be hugely challenging but we will continue to conduct ourselves compassionately and professionally.I say this directly to the public. If you don’t heed this government’s advice, then it is likely further steps may need to be taken further laws and emergency legislation could be introduced to clamp down harder on selfishness in the face of the fight against this virus. This is about saving lives.None of us wants new, harsher measures. I have been a police officer for over 27 years, and it is the last thing I want. But either the public heeds the Prime Minister’s warning and stays at home, or the fight against COVID-19 will be longer and more will likely be affected.From my experience as a police officer, I know the public do not wish this to happen. So, I ask everybody to be responsible and to remain indoors. John Apter is chair of the police federation in England and WalesPolitics latest news: Parliament to shut down tonight to slow spread of coronavirusHow do I join the NHS coronavirus volunteer campaign - and what would I do?Can I go to work?

The Government will not get away with throwing them to the wolvesMy local policeman dropped by last week and told me that farmers and smallholders are worried that people might soon start stealing their eggs, chickens and even this season’s lambs. Though the village in which I live is only 20 miles from Downing Street, this is a different world – one in which those with their finger on the pulse realise the desperate plight faced by the self-employed thanks to the coronavirus.There is no doubt that the Chancellor’s financial support package is unprecedented in size and scope. The announcement that the government will pay up to 80 per cent of workers’ wages up to £2,500 will certainly allow many firms to go into hibernation and should keep people in work. It has been welcomed by the trades unions and many well-established businesses. Equally, the loan offer that has been made to companies which meet certain criteria will certainly suit some successful concerns. For example, this week I heard of a small independent pub chain which is keen to borrow £5 million in order to buy up distressed competitors. For enterprises like this one, the economic crash is an opportunity and the government is there to help them.When one looks at the overall picture, however, the measures introduced by Rishi Sunak #do not address some very basic questions. On a practical level, I am not convinced that the banks will be able to process large numbers of applications in short order. At the same time, many firms will worry about taking on yet more debt and will decide that company liquidation is the only way out. It is a sad inevitability that there will be many business casualties.But aside from these criticisms, one of the most pressing problems surely lies with the 11 million people who do not earn regular wages. Some of them run their own limited companies. Others act as sole traders. Many, of course, work on zero hours contracts or are employed seasonally. Together, this group makes up one third of Britain’s workforce yet, so far, little has been done for them.If somebody in this bracket runs out of cash, the fact that there is a VAT referral or a mortgage holiday in place will be irrelevant. And while the statutory sick pay that is available to these people is to be welcomed, the £94-a-week on offer simply isn’t enough for a family of four to live on. With all of this in mind, my best guess is that by the middle of April millions of people will be unable to afford sufficient amounts of basic food and household goods. They need help from the Chancellor.In the past there was a culture, particularly among the self-employed, of saving for a rainy day. But after years of low interest rates and the impossibility for those aged under-40 of owning their own property, it has evaporated. The concept of thrift is an alien one to younger generations. Many live not just a hand-to-mouth existence, but one that is based upon hire purchase agreements and mounting credit card debts. Time is now the enemy of these people, who work in a huge variety of sectors from hairdressing to computer programming.The Government’s key priority today is, of course, the health of the nation, followed by the economy, but I don’t think enough thought has yet been given to the societal impact of this situation or, indeed, to law and order. If the Government is perceived to be helping big corporate entities while throwing to the wolves the 11 million-strong army of men and women described above, the reaction could be very ugly. The idea of wages still being paid to somebody who works for a mothballed company, and a family living next door whose main earner is self-employed not being able to buy staple foods, is unthinkable.  In the middle of a national emergency, something has to be done to make us believe that we really are all in this together. The only solution that I can see that could be implemented quickly to help the 11 million people who do not have a fixed income would be the introduction of helicopter money, the policy which results in cash being distributed to iniduals directly. If £1,000 was paid every month for the next three months into the bank and building society accounts of the adult population, the cost to the country would be £120 billion. This is a vast sum but it could, in fact, be a small price to pay if it maintains national unity in our troubled nation. The Irish government is already implementing such plans. It won’t be long before Donald Trump does the same in America. Rishi Sunak must follow suit. Otherwise, I fear my local farmers will be proved right.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Almost as quickly, a tide of moralism has swept the nation.Some commentators – in lieu of outdoor activities, perhaps – seem to delight in judging others lambasting their fellow citizens who are still forced to use public transport to get to work, fuming over photographs of groups in nearby parks or wheeling groaning trolleys around supermarkets.London Mayor Sadiq Khan took to the airwaves to criticise Tube passengers, after photos emerged of packed trains at rush hour. Khan’s hand-wringing is hypocritical in the extreme. Transport for London’s decision to cut down rail journeys had the predictable consequence of putting the remaining services under extra pressure when millions are still needed at work.The NHS alone employs hundreds of thousands in the capital, before you include the army of street-sweepers, electricians, builders, teachers, couriers and other workers required to keep the cogs of the city in motion. Listening to the moralists of Twitter, however, you’d be forgiven for thinking they were travelling solely for their own amusement.Class isions drive much of this outrage. The elites of Islington and Stoke Newington evidently have little idea of what the poor look like, how they live – or that the coronavirus lockdown bears relatively lightly on the privileged middle classes.Many can work from home, stockpile wine in their cellars, plant their neat vegetable gardens, and pack their multiple chest freezers with mounds of food. Yet blue-collar work – by definition – cannot be done remotely, while poorer consumers, lacking storage space, must shop more. Garden-owners have urged the closure of public parks, apparently unaware of the crucial role these spaces play in the lives of those who lack green acres of their own.The self-employed face a singularly agonising choice, between practising social distancing or losing their income. Many without substantial savings are facing ruin, thanks to the abrupt termination of every gig in their portfolio. Then there are all those people who rely on cash-in-hand work. For white-collar workers to insist on total subjugation from the most precarious sections of the economy has more than a ring of apocryphal Marie Antoinette (“Let them work from home”).George Orwell identified a similar trend in The Road to Wigan Pier, in his portrayal of the unthinking middle classes unable to compute why their working-class counterparts insisted on eating tasty but less healthy meals. “Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread?” asked one critic. Today’s well-intentioned bourgeoisie shows a similar disregard for the trade-offs which inform their fellow citizens’ choices.I am not arguing for a world devoid of moral judgments – shame is an important tool in changing behaviour. But the speed with which so many keyboard warriors have rushed to judgment on people whose lives are far less secure than their own is shocking. Perhaps our unforgiving “cancel culture”, the digital lynch mob permanently poised to ruin lives, has left Britain ill-equipped to cope humanely with the cultural impact of the coronavirus.Scratch below the surface of movements rooted in shame and you will often encounter the hectoring middle classes from the Victorian temperance brigades to the sanctimonious Edwardian ladies proffering the white feather of cowardice to apparently able-bodied men in times of war. Occasionally, they would mistakenly hand out feathers to injured servicemen, failing to note the amputee’s wooden leg.There are lessons in this today – we simply don’t know who we may be judging. One colleague is “stockpiling” on behalf of five households – a total of 15 people, all either vulnerable or isolating, on top of her own family unit.Lives will not be the only casualties in the tough months ahead. The economy will be stalled as we accrue wartime levels of debt and enter a global recession. Personal liberty will – rightly – be curtailed as we endure sacrifices that, a few months ago, would have seemed unthinkable. Losing so much that we hold dear, it is crucial that we retain our basic decency.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailRishi Sunak said on Friday that workers on zero-hours contracts would be covered, as long as they were paid through PAYE. But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The mother of one employee told The Independent she was concerned that Dexters\u0027 approach could put the health of her family and the wider public at unnecessary risk.The estate agent\u0027s founder and chairman Jeff Doble said he believed the criticism was unfair and that much of the work Dexters does cannot be carried out from home.He said Dexters was in the process of winding downon Tuesday but pointed to the fact that the government\u0027s lockdown announcement was only yesterday giving little time for firms to prepare.On Monday night, the prime minister told people not to go out apart from in very limited circumstances including attending medical appointments and buying food.\u0026nbspThe latest intensification of social distancing measures means people should only go out for work where this absolutely cannot be done from home.Anyone caught breaking the rules faces a fine of up to £1,000 from Thursday, when a bill containing the new legislation to deal with coronavirus is expected to become law.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company had claimed it was “uniquely well-placed to help keep the UK as fit and healthy as possible during this crisis”.“Thus our Sports Direct and Evans Cycles stores will remain open where possible to allow us to do this (in accordance with the government’s current social distancing guidance),” finance chief Chris Wooton told staff in a letter.However, the company said on Tuesday morning its shops would close their doors.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

For Mike had been quiet as a mouse.Could the appointment of a worker director in the wake of the scandal at his Derbyshire warehouse – you may recall that searches on the way out contributed to some staff getting less than the minimum wage for their time – have worked the oracle?Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesCould it be that Mike had become Saul, changing from bad boss to an apostle of commercial humanity on the road to Damascus (or at least to Derby)?Guess not. The Institute for Business Ethics had best put the Christmas Party invite on ice. Time to mothball that Everlast hoodie. It’s not something you’d want to be seen wearing in public. Or even in lockdown, at least this morning, because there was Ashley all over the news insisting Sports Direct stores were as essential as Sainsbury’s, because what everyone needs in the middle of a global pandemic is a pair of brand new Lonsdale sweatbands.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThey would remain open, Ashley insisted, to keep the public fit and healthy in their homes. Plus, it’s Nike Air Max week.In making that decision, Ashley managed something I’d previously thought impossible. For a brief moment, he made Michael Gove look like something other than a slimy snake oil salesman.I know. That’s still a bit like the Joker doing something so stupid and terrible in Gotham City that even the Penguin is moved to admonish him.But wait! Performing a hand brake turn that even The Sweeney’s Jack Regan might feel good about, Mike changed his mind.Sports Direct stores would close up, after all, leaving the online operation to pick up the slack and flog the home exercise equipment (surprise surprise, Ashley and co are pushing that hard).It doesn’t quite absolve him from doing something so unbelievable crass and stupid as to claim Sports Direct stores were essential services in the middle of a global pandemic.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rest assured, if you want your Covid-19 bogeyman, the gammon-faced publican is there for you.\u0026nbspHis latest in a lengthening list of unfortunate pronouncements was his suggestion that if his staff – the same who have done so much to make his business successful, and him rich beyond his wildest dreams – should be offered jobs at supermarkets, then good luck to them.Will done, Timbo.

That will give extra information on where the disease is spreading to, and how it affects different people.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAll of those inidual reports will be gathered together into a data set that will be given to health organisations such as the NHS and research institutions including universities, the developers say.Researchers hope to use that data to help slow the outbreak by learning how fast the virus spreads, where the highest-risk areas are, and who is most at risk. Tracking symptoms will also help researchers better understand how the symptoms of Covid-19 are linked to underlying health conditions, researchers say.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe app –\u0026nbspcurrently only available in the UK, but launching in the US on Thursday – could help answer important questions about the disease such as why some people develop severe and fatal symptoms while others only experience relatively mild ones. It may also help doctors distinguish between the very similar symptoms of Covid-19 infection and seasonal coughs or colds, and to make it easier for people to better understand what is making them unwell.The study is open to the public and anyone can download the app for free through the app store. To use it, they must consent to the app\u0027s privacy policy, which allows personal health data to be shared with research institutions but commits not to use it for commercial purposes.The app is created by nutrition company Zoe, which is led by Tim Spector,\u0026nbspprofessor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London.\u0026nbspZoe began at King\u0027s before being launched as a private company, and researchers from the university and other organisations helped to create the app.It will also make use of data and participants from the TwinsUK study, which has profiled 15,000 identical and non-identical twins over three decades in an attempt to gather important medical information. Twins that are part of that study will be able to record information about their health, and if they show symptoms of Covid-19 will be sent a testing kit that will allow for better understanding of symptoms.“These are worrying times for everyone, said Professor Spector.\u0026nbspOur twins are fantastically committed, enthusiastic health research participants who have already been studied in unprecedented detail, putting us in a unique position to provide vital answers to support the global fight against COVID-19. The more of the public that also use the app, the better the real-time data we will have to combat the outbreak in this country.”Members of the public that participate through the app will not have access to the home testing part of the study.​The app is available on the Apple and Google app stores in the UK now. It is coming to the US on 26 March, Zoe said.The success of the app comes as the NHS launched its own app intended to allow volunteers to sign up and help the NHS, which has already seen more than 170,000 people sign up.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, her contract did not guarantee any hours each week.The job was her sole source of income, as it was for a number of now unemployed colleagues. The university had decided that all “non-essential parts of its business” would be closed down, the message informed them.The university says it\u0026nbsphas received “assurances” from Aramark that all staff will continue to be paid through the Covid-19 closure. Aramark promised to pass on further information when it could, but a week later nothing has materialised. Aramark did not respond to requests for comment.The situation highlights a lacuna in the government’s jobs support package. Last week, the chancellor said the government would, for the first time in Britain’s history, step in to pay private sector wages. The move means state grants will cover up to 80 per cent of salaries for workers “furloughed” –\u0026nbspon a company’s payroll but temporarily not needed for work.The idea is that once Covid-19 is under control and trade picks up again, those employees can start working without having to go out and find a new job.It has been welcomed by unions and workers but the scheme only applies where companies decide to take it up.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But many of these workers have simply been let go en masse in any case. Self-employed workers, who are not on PAYE, are not covered at all and will have to claim benefits if their work dries up and no new government measures are enacted.Powell says she will not be able to pay rent this month, nor will several former colleagues.“I’ve applied for universal credit but it’s a five-week wait at the outset. They’re trying to make it faster but I don’t know if that’s likely to happen given the entire hospitality industry is probably knocking on their door right now.“I’m feeling pretty grim about it. It’s a bit dismaying. The silver lining that’s come out of it is that we’ve all really come together as a workforce, everyone who works at the bar.“We’ve got nothing to lose now so we’re all ready to fight to be paid through the closure.”They are taking the fight to the University with the help of the Independent Workers\u0027 Union of Great Britain (IWGB) to demand they are paid throughout the shutdown for the hours they\u0027ve been working over the past three months.More details on government support for zero-hours workers will be revealed “shortly”, the chancellor said last week. Further support is also expected to be forthcoming for the self-employed. For Powell and others in her position, the clarification cannot come soon enough.Coronavirus poses a slightly different, but no less daunting, problem for Sandra Tochez, a cleaner at University of London.Until Friday, she cleaned the university’s Senate House building for three hours every weekday morning. In the afternoon, she made her way over to the halls fo residence to clean. Then she was told not to come in.She says that the outsourcing company that employs her, Cordant, told her and several other cleaners that they would only be paid for their “contracted” hours.For Tochez, that meant just the three hours in the morning, so her pay had more than halved. If Tochez had been furloughed under the government’s scheme, she would have received 80 per cent of her pay for three months.She had been fighting for two years to have the four hours she works every afternoon to be recognised on her contract rather than classified as “overtime”. She says Cordant has refused.Cordant disputes Tochez’s account and\u0026nbspsays: “All staff across our business will continue to be paid for their contractual hours as well as any overtime worked.”This gives little comfort to Tochez and the other cleaners.“We are all extremely worried as we all have debts to pay and this money is not going to be enough to make the payments,” she says.“We are all thinking, ‘how are we going to manage, how are we going to pay rent?’”“It’s just not acceptable that they do this to people who have been working there for such a long time.”Millions of self-employed and gig economy workers who at present have even less financial support if they can\u0027t work during the pandemic.Greg Howard, a rider for food delivery service Deliveroo, says his recent decision to self-isolate cost him around £400 a week.\u0026nbspIt is stressful. I don\u0027t know how long this situation is going to go on for, nobody does. It does put a bit of fear and a bit of trepidation in me, says Howard.Deliveroo has set up a hardship fund for its riders who cannot work but there have been problems accessing it because riders must provide a doctor\u0027s note. The government announced in the Budget that workers could obtain one via the NHS\u0027 111 helpline but this service is not yet available.With millions of people now in enforced isolation, drivers involved in food distribution are recognised as crucial for the functioning of the economy but many feel they do not have the support they need.Courier services often do not employ staff directly but treat them as independent contractors, leaving the onus on the inidual to ensure they are safe, well and not at risk of spreading the virus.\u0026nbspRiders are doing all they can to protect themselves and others but they are being put in a difficult position, as Howard explains: Deliveroo have announced they will fund up to £20 the purchase of hand sanitisers, hand gels, soap, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t get hold of that, nobody can get hold of that.He believes that Deliveroo has been better at helping riders through the coronavirus crisis so far than some other gig economy companies, but there is much more to do.Alex Marshall, 35, couriers \u0026amp logistics branch chair of the IWGB union, is pushing for firms to cover riders\u0027 pay if they can\u0027t work.He adds: These companies need to take some responsibilities for workers that really could be integral to society to keep moving forward in these really troubling times.They can\u0027t continue to just say that these people are self-employed and totally in control of their own sanitising and everything. That responsibility is too much for one guy on his motorbike with a box on the back.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, Avengers Assemble still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all.  5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22.

Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.You can also access Disney+ online here\u0026nbspand, for some people, you can even stream six months for free.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

While hantavirus does refer to a dangerous family of viruses, they are not comparable to the new coronavirus and are nowhere near as dangerous.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHantavirus is not new at all, having been known about for decades and potentially been active for even longer it does not easily pass between humans it can only be caught by consuming the bodily fluids of rats or mice and the world is much better equipped to deal with it, including holding vaccines.The false messages appear to be attempting to seize on fear around the outbreak of coronavirus to encourage people to share yet more worrying information, and are likely to cause unnecessary anxiety in people already concerned about pandemics.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsThe WhatsApp messages often make explicit reference to the new coronavirus, suggesting that it could follow in a similar manner.“When the whole world is still suffering from Covid-19, here comes another virus...” one seen by The Independent reads. “The ‘hanta virus’ has been detected in China, mainly caused by rodents. One already died and few tested positive.”The story about a death does appear to be correct. Chinese state newspaper Global Times reported that one man had died on his way to\u0026nbspShandong Province on his way to work.The tweet of that story has now been shared nearly 15,000 times on Twitter alone, and has probably been screengrabbed and spread across the world as an image. While the report of a death is true, any suggestion that it is similar to the outbreak of coronavirus is unfounded for now.Hantavirus is no doubt a very serious family of diseases. Symptoms can be very severe and it has been known to cause deaths.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeThe viruses taken together are a family of viruses that are spread by different rodents, and cause a variety of different disease syndromes. Infection can lead to one of a number of different syndromes, which each have their own rodent hosts and\u0026nbspare geographically specific: though hantaviruses are found across the Americas, Europe and Asia, the regions lead to different syndromes and symptoms.Infection usually comes from consuming the urine, faeces or saliva or a rodent, though more rarely it can come from being bitten. People are at particular risk if they live in dusty areas with rodent infestations.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s absolute bulls***,” Elba said. “Such stupidness. People wanna spread that as if it’s news. That’s stupid.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhile Elba did not name the source of the conspiracy theory, rapper Cardi B previously made reference to the theory in her own Instagram Live days prior.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your hands“Let’s say if I have the coronavirus right now,” the rapper said. “How am I supposed to know I got it?

While many famous faces have tested positive for the illness, or learned they do not have Covid-19 via testing, many ordinary people in the UK and US have so far been unable to get tested themselves.“I think the debate about rich and poor and who’s getting it and who’s not, I think, is not a healthy debate,” Elba said. “It’s like, I got a test but I also got Covid. Does that make me preferential? I don’t understand that.”He continued: “This isn’t a movie. I’m not an actor right now. I’m just a human being and I just happen to be in the public eye. So I want people to understand that this is very real. I don’t feel like I’m privileged because I got a test because I actually contracted it.”Elba is one of many stars, including Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson and Olga Kurylenko, who have tested positive for coronavirus.He suggested, in an interview with Oprah Winfrey, that the pandemic is Earth’s response to being “damaged”.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Although with some cities, including nearby El Alto, now seeing nightly battles between police and protestors, it would seem not everyone is following the new laws quite to the letter.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“Except for food supplies, we’re not going out at all,” says Molly, a marketing executive, from the three-room apartment. “If we caught the virus here and needed treatment, we’ve no idea what would happen. We hear the hospitals are already being overwhelmed.”They have repeatedly, they say, contacted the British embassy begging for help. Each time, they are told to stay put and hold tight. But more than a week since the country’s borders were sealed off, no help – or even suggestion of help – has been forthcoming. They feel, they say, “abandoned”.“I just want to be home,” says Molly. “It doesn’t feel safe here. The curfew is supposed to be in place until 4 April but our neighbour says the rioting will only get worse the longer it goes on.”Their desperate plight reflects that of hundreds of thousands of people stranded abroad as country after country across the globe shut their borders and airlines dropped flights – often without any notice – in a bid to prevent the pandemic.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said last week that up to a million Brits could be stranded abroad, unable to return for possibly months.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have found, not only was it hard to get in contact with someone, but since I have, the updates are brief, they’re not personal and they don’t fill you with a lot of confidence.”The couple – who met while studying at the University of Nottingham – had been in South America for seven months on their once-in-lifetime trip.Last Monday, with foreign office advice still suggesting it safe to be abroad, the couple set out on a three-day excursion to Bolivia’s remote salt flats.But within hours of setting off, they received news that next-door Chile was cutting off its borders for a period. And, by Tuesday – with the couple a day-long drive from Uyuni, the nearest city – that advice from the British government had also changed: it now said nationals should avoid all non-essential overseas travel.“Safe to say, that put a dampener on the excursion,” says Molly, who is originally from King’s Lynn. “That’s really when we decided we needed to get home – but it took until Wednesday to get back to Uyuni.”From there it was another day of travel for them to Santa Cruz’s Viru Viru International Airport,\u0026nbspthe country’s biggest, where they were told all planes had been grounded.“We were showing staff all these flights on Skyscanner,” says Molly. “They were looking at them going, ‘These flights no longer exist, I’m sorry’.”Acting on advice that the land border with Brazil remained open, the couple headed there,\u0026nbspwith three Australians they had met at the airport –\u0026nbspin the hope they could catch a flight to Europe once across the border.“It was an eight-hour journey with five of us plus luggage in a four-seater car,” says Molly. “It was the worst journey of my life. We went in a store on route and asked for Coca-Cola. The guy passed us a bag of cocaine. ‘No, no. Just a drink’.”At the border, they were turned away. After several hours queueing, gun-toting guards said all crossings had been stopped. When the couple tried to show officials they had connecting flights to Europe booked from an airport just six kilometres away, they were told it did not matter.When they tried to argue the point, one guard unclipped his gun. Clips on Brazilian news showed the chaos as hundreds tried to make the same pleas.“It was the scariest moment of my life,” says Molly. “We left pretty soon after that.”Now back in La Paz – which the British embassy said would be the most likely destination for a rescue flight – they are sitting each day, hitting refresh on the government’s website, hoping to be saved. So far, without any luck.“It feels like we’re prisoners,” says Harry, from Bishop Stortford. “We have nothing to do but are just trying to fill our heads with as much knowledge about the situation as possible so we can try and be prepared.”They have, they say, no real medical supplies. “Well, we have a thermometer in a first aid pack so, if one of us gets it, at least we’ll know,” says Molly.Responding to the criticism that they had done little to help, a spokesperson for the foreign office said: “We recognise that any British people currently overseas may be nervous about the impact of coronavirus on their travel and their health.“We are in close contact with travel providers and our international partners to provide support to those British people affected by ongoing measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.”But the statement was of little comfort to the couple.“We know we’re not the only people in this situation,” says Harry. “We know there are others far worse off. But we wanted to share our story, I suppose, to show what we feel is neglect by the government. Not just to us but to thousands of people also trapped in different parts of the world.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The company has an annual turnover of £1.8 billion.In contrast to firms such as Costa – which has promised to carry on paying full wages for at least eight weeks – Mr Martin also suggested staff would receive no more than the government stipend.I can completely understand it.

I know this is incredibly difficult, this is an emotionally fraught time and a difficult one,” he said. “Wherever possible if there could be contact through social media, or non-physical contact then that should carry on.”Family orce lawyers have previously raised concerns around social distancing measures, with one telling The Independent there was widespread “confusion” about what arrangements between couples might mean.How to help the elderly and vulnerable during the coronavirusHow to feel less anxious about the coronavirusHow to be productive when working from home during coronavirusWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?The dirty truth about washing your handsClarifying his comments in a second interview on the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Gove said: “On another broadcast on Good Morning Britain, I was asked specifically about orced or separated parents and whether or not children could move from one household to another.“One of the things that is clear is that if it is the case that children are under the age of 18 need to move from one parent’s home to another parent’s home, that is allowed.“Within the context of all us seeking to reduce social contact, that is allowed. I was not clear earlier on that broadcast.”On his Twitter account, the Cabinet Office minister added: “I wasn’t clear enough earlier, apologies. To confirm – while children should not normally be moving between households, we recognise that this may be necessary when children who are under 18 move between separate parents. This is permissible and has been made clear in the guidance.”Government advice, released on Monday evening after the prime minister’s address, states: “Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents’ homes”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is a real kick in the teeth at this time when people are being laid off and struggling to get by”.\u0026nbspThe new rules are intended to help consumers by banning daily overdraft charges which the regulator says can be expensive and confusing.

But, if you consider your own social circle, you basically meet the same people every day,” he said. “You can meet new people on public transportation, for example but even on the bus, after sometime most passengers will either be infected or immune.”Mr Levitt said that social distancing measures have been helpful in reducing the virus’ ability to spread rapidly.He suggested that the higher percentage of elderly people in Italy paired with the country’s vibrant social culture resulted in the explosion of cases in that country.“Furthermore, Italian culture is very warm and Italians have a very rich social life. For these reasons, it is important to keep people apart and prevent sick people from coming into contact with healthy people,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It must isolate as many people as possible to buy time for preparations. Otherwise, it can end up in a situation where 20,000 infected people will descend on the nearest hospital at the same time and the healthcare system will collapse,” he said.Mr Levitt said that while isolating was an important step to fighting viral spread, he also believes a certain segment of the population may be naturally immune to the disease.He said those numbers suggest that some people simply are immune or especially resistant to the virus.Mr Levitt’s predictions stand in contrast to those that suggest we may be dealing with the coronavirus for months or even years.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Another smokes a cigarette.Chinese officials and some public health experts have credited the draconian confinement measures on a city of 11 million, and much of Hubei province, of which it is the capital, with slowing the spread of the disease and turning the tide of infection across China.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOther countries, including Iran, Italy and the United States, are struggling to manage their outbreaks.\u0026nbspBut even as the number of new reported cases stops in Wuhan, people in the city remain suspended in an isolated new normal.Residents are forbidden from venturing out of their homes even to buy food, which must be delivered.

In normal times, everyone is busy, at work all day.We rarely see even the lovely couple who live across the landing. The streets below teem with workers, always in a hurry.Now these streets are empty. Our neighbours stay indoors, self-isolating.But we still see each other more than ever before, on the way to supermarkets for Silver Hour or grabbing some fresh air. We stand well apart, chat about the only subject in town and exchange offers of help. The City of London has become a village again.We receive tip-offs about loo roll delivery times or surprise consignments of hand gel and wet wipes at the nearby ­pharmacy.WhatsApp support groups have sprung up, advising on contactless payment via online bank accounts or how to spend your time indoors. Laptops are a leline.A frail friend and neighbour politely declines my offer to pick up her prescription.“I’m inundated with calls,” she says. “Everyone’s so kind.”Not everything is so fraternal.There is real anger at the hoarders in our midst — at people like the couple who arrived home with trolleys piled high and a new freezer to store three months of food.The Sun picture of a ­Teesside shopper with  loo rolls hit a nerve, along with the scumbag who made £, selling them at £ each to pensioners.So did private cardiologist Dr Mark Ali, who — says The Sunday Times — made £.million in a week flogging coronavirus test kits for £ a go — three times the cost price.Most employers are doing the decent thing, using help from Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep workers on  per cent pay.But others are seizing the chance to slash their payroll, risking a huge spike in ­unemployment once the crisis is over. Some household-name ­companies have not covered themselves with glory.EasyJet effectively abandoned passengers stuck in foreign parts with no way home until Sunak stuffed taxpayers’ cash down their throats.My we and I escaped from Cyprus last week on one of the last ­scheduled flights before hotels and airports were shut down.A lot of EasyJet over-s passengers feared being stranded with nowhere to stay.This crisis has hit Downing Street hard, with ministers and officials working -hour days, almost hot-bedding in No as they struggle to cope with fast-changing events.London, the UK epicentre of contagion, is in lockdown as the death toll spurts faster than tragic Italy’s at this stage of the spread. Did Boris get it right  We’ll soon know.It is interesting to observe the reaction of dferent age groups to this pandemic.Schoolchildren are understandably scared by the headlines. Old folk, some of them war babies, are more fatalistic.But some in their s and s are flagrantly ignoring advice to self-isolate.They are the least likely to die of this bug but risk putting thousands of fellow Brits in an early grave.A few months ago, the UK was split by what now seems a harmless spat over Brexit.There were Remainer black “jokes” that Britain would rejoin the EU once all we Brexit fogies had popped our clogs and the Eurosceptic virus had been eliminated.Covid- may be culling the elderly, but at least it’s impartial.They applaud their “friends” in Russia, China and others even more extreme who will take advantage of crippled Western economies, especially in Europe.Once we are through this pandemic, the next truly momentous battle will be between the West’s cash-strapped but creative “free spirits” and the authoritarian iron fists of the former Soviet era. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Our nation will never be the same again.So many features of our society will be transformed, from the way we are governed to where we work and how we entertain ourselves.The state will be far bigger and more powerful. Free enterprise will no longer flourish. Welfare dependency, even for businesses, will the new norm.Our social lives will reshape around the home, with travel firms, cinemas and restaurants feeling the burden, while key workers like our NHS heroes will replace narcissistic celebrities in our adoration.And in practice, we will live under a socialist system, where the government has effectively nationalised the entire economy.That dramatic change will be a legacy of the extraordinary measures adopted by the Treasury in the face of the coronavirus challenge.The Chancellor Rishi Sunak has recently announced a range of policies that amount to the biggest bailout in history, including a £ billion rescue package for businesses, a massive expansion in the social security system, and an unprecedented subsidy of up to  per cent for wages in the private sector.This vast intervention is on top of the Budget a fortnight ago, in which Mr Sunak announced the biggest increase in public expenditure since the s, as well as a colossal £ billion capital investment fund for infrastructure projects.Great Britain PLC has now been the subject of a takeover by the state.Mr Sunak’s phenomenal splurge is more radical than anything even Jeremy Corbyn proposed at the last election. And the clock will not be turned back.Having tasted economic control on an epic scale, Whitehall and Westminster will be reluctant to give it up.After all, the post-war socialist expansion of the state by the - Labour Government was not reversed for decades, despite long periods of Conservative rule, until Margaret Thatcher came to power in .Recent nationalisations like those of the railways and airlines will remain in place. The public sector will continue to dominate.But the new socialist Britain will be poorer and less dynamic.The services sector, which currently accounts for  per cent of the economy, will take decades to recover from the shutdown imposed by the coronavirus panic.With the collapse of so many businesses, especially in the hospitality trade and retailing, mass unemployment will cast a long shadow.At the same time, record levels of government debt will require huge levels of borrowing and higher taxation.The fall-out from the coronavirus crisis will probably also make our nation more inward-looking and less enthusiastic about globalisation.The barriers that are now going up around Europe will remain in place, while Britain is likely to impose stronger border controls.Immigration, currently running at over , new arrivals every year, is bound to plummet, especially when shrunken firms cannot claim to need cheap foreign labour.The international travel industry will continue to struggle once the crisis is over, with clients fearful of health risks.With reduced activity, it seems doubtful that the third runway at Heathrow Airport will ever be built.Ruined airlines and cruise companies will look back on pre-corona days as a golden age, though domestic tourism may receive a boost from the greater number of Brits holidaying at home.The Covid- catastrophe has exposed how fragile our inter-connected world really is.In an attempt to reduce our vulnerability, Britain is likely to become far more self-sufficient by strengthening our domestic supply lines, rebuilding our manufacturing base and bolstering the agricultural sector.Similarly, our dangerous dependence on Chinese contractors for everything from nuclear power to broadband technology will end.Future governments will be reluctant to reach the kind of deal that Boris Johnson recently did with the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei to play a key role in the expansion of the G network.One key result of the Covid crackdown has been to show businesses that it is perfectly possible for a signicant number of their employees to work from home, thanks to the web.This trend is bound to gather pace even when the crisis has passed.The huge increase in home working will herald a long-term decline in the office, for so long one of the symbols of our sophisticated civilisation.And the consequences of such a change will be enormous.Commercial property, which is estimated to be worth around £ billion in Britain, will drastically fall in value.Commuting by road or rail will become far less common, leaving trains emptier and roads less congested.For the first time since rail privatisation, passenger numbers will drop signicantly.Nor will there be any justication for huge, expensive transport projects like the £ billion HS rail link or the vast proposed new £ billion Lower Thames crossing, linking Kent and Essex by road.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.In a culture dominated by home working, expensive city living will lose much of its appeal.Already overblown, property bubbles in fashionable hotspots like London and Manchester could soon burst.Yet, while the urban housing market runs into deep trouble, coastal and rural regions may well see a revival.Will Margate be the new Islington On a more profound level, the shock of the present crisis will leave us more oriented towards our homes and family le.We will be less obsessed with eating out, more focused on home entertainment. TV streaming services will grow rapidly. Cinema chains will shrink.Hardly any area of British le will be free of the covid revolution’s impact.Throughout the academic world, there will be more respect for valuable, practical subjects like science, engineering and medicine - and less for academic pursuits like media studies.In politics, there is likely to be less partisanship and more consensus, as highlighted by the remarkable praise heaped last week on Mr Sunak by the TUC for his bailout.In a shell-shocked country, trying to recover from economic meltdown and social lockdown, there won’t be much time for isive fads, poisonous identity politics or invented victimhood.Shrieking about safe spaces will sound like pathetic self-indulgence in a society where thousands are likely to have died from the Corona killer.What could be beneficial for Britain is a fundamental rethink about the values of our age.The health crisis has graphically revealed who really matters when it comes to the le-and-death crunch.As the death toll mounts, it is not the property speculators, lawyers, quango chiefs, and hedge fund managers that keep our country going, despite their vast financial rewards.It is the NHS staff, the care home workers, the retail assistants, the emergency services personnel, the lorry drivers and the shelf-stackers, many of whom have limited earnings.Perhaps in the new Britain forged by the coronavirus, we will lavish more on our carers, and less on our celebrities.Out of the current despair, we may come to recognise our real priorities.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

One teacher got an email last night from a parent asking us to mark workthey sent photos through.You just think, ‘We are quite busy at the moment!’There are long term worries too, what do we do at the end of this The kids have missed an entire term. And what happens to Year Sixs  Do they not go to secondary school A few of my children have asked what’s happening and it can make you feel quite helpless.”Peter Booth, , from Leicestershire is a self-employed plumber running his family business GV Booth, with help from his -year-old dad – who manages the company’s office work.He says: “There’s so much confusion from last night.I’m in quite a few WhatsApp groups and there were a lot of arguments when some guys said they’d have to keep working and others disagreed.Some who know they can’t survive on £-a-week will insist on working still.It’s very hard for Boris Johnson, but we just need some guidance.I’m now only doing emergencies myself. Today I’ve got an -year-old man that’s got no heating or hot water — so it’s urgent.It’s going to be very much down to interpretation.Then the other thing is my main merchants has closed today for  hours to decide what to do.SoI go to this job today and can’t get the parts for the older man, he may have to wait more than  hours without hot water.I’d be happy to sit at home today, with my phone on, thenI get an emergency I can plan it properly and go.You can also make sure your kit is all disinfected, your hands are washed, butyou’re rushing between jobs then you might become a bit lax.”Sam Oxley, , is a senior sous chef at Italian restaurant Forza Win, in Peckham, South London. He says: I was so relieved after the restaurant shut down and we began work straight away to create a new delivery menu.It was a relief to have something to concentrate on.A lot of suppliers, now that there are no restaurants to supply, are also in trouble, so the knock on effect has been huge.We had planned to launch a new service straight away, delivering a menu including fresh pasta and sauces that could be put together and cooked at home.However, the dficult decision was taken that we needed a week out first to take stock, ensure we were social distancing, and were all healthy ourselves before starting.But everything is changing so rapidly. With heavy hearts following Boris’ lockdown announcement last night, the decision has now been made not to go ahead with deliveries at all.These are extraordinary times, and while it’s shown the worst in some people, with stockpiling, it’s shown the best in others.Our customers have bought hundreds of pounds worth of vouchers to show their support to us.It’s so touching to see how much customers appreciate the meals we cook.I can speak for every small business when I say: your support means so much.Dr Murray Ellender, , is a London-based GP and co-founder of eConsult.He says: “There are pregnant doctors who are now going to have to come back to work.It’s really dficult – we need all the workforce we can get on the frontline.Yesterday was really busy and we had a number of doctors cancel last minute.Either they were unwell or had family members with symptoms which meant they had to self-isolate, which is not their fault.My colleague Clare Gerada, who had Covid- and has since recovered, is now helping out with patient care but not seeing the patients face-to-face.Those doctors who’ve had it can go back to work feeling a bit more confident they’re not going to get ill. Clare’s a super doctor!The key message I’m trying to get out to all patients is that they can do their bit, too.Across the UK, GPs have , practices which deal with a million patient contacts a day. Soit’s not urgent, don’t contact us.If you think you need to see a GP, don’t necessarily think you have to come into the building.Cases we saw yesterday and dealt with remotely were things like patients with rashes or eczema, female patients with urinary tract infections, even things like mental health conditions such as anxiety or depression.We’re seeing a lot of patient anxiety, understandably. But those cases we can manage remotely.Go on your practice site rather than calling your GP – we need to keep phone lines open for elderly patients who arent online.Shannon Summerfield, , is a support worker with not-for-profit Dimensions in Cardf. The organisation offers help to those with learning disabilities, autism, challenging behaviour and complex needs.She says: I thought the lockdown was the right decision - it’s just quite worrying because it’s something we’ve never seen before.We’re going to be giving all our ladies’ families a call today as they all probably quite upset about the news.We’re going to make sure those in our care are well looked after and supported as best we can.A few of the ladies here are quite vulnerable and are very high risk. I think it’s best they stay in the house.We’re just trying to keep them as safe as we can.My mum, a nurse, will have to be in work more now. She’s going to have loads of staff off with isolation, so she’ll probably be working a lot more.Last night I was quite worried, it was a bit of a panic.My work is on the same road I live on, so in my head I was just thinking, ‘I’m only going to be seeing one road for the next few weeks!’I’m thinking about people’s mental health as well, which might deteriorate because of this lockdown.Raegan Drew, , is a funeral director for the Co-op Funeralcare in Edinburgh.She says: “As funeral providers we have a social responsibility so, because of the stricter enforcement last night, we have decided to cut the number of mourners to ten, down from .Obviously the situation changes hourly and daily, so that number could change.We saw a huge drop in the amount of people attending from the middle of last week and this week more people seem to be making the decision for themselves and not attending.I conducted just one funeral yesterday and only a handful of people were there, because more people are self-isolating and taking advantage of the web services.Crematoriums are moving us to bigger chapels where they can to help people stay further apart, and we are encouraging social distancing.This is not the funeral many people would have wished or planned for so we are now offering families a memorial service at a later date to celebrate their loved ones.We have been issued guidelines for dealing with a coronavirus death and we have Personal Protection Equipmentto deal with that, although I haven’t personally used it yet.We are calling our families on a daily basis to update them, and everyone has been very understanding.The message has hit home – safety first.”Katie*, , is a social worker, supporting vulnerable young adults between -, many of whom have left the care or prison system, and often have severe mental health issues.She says: “This morning has been filled with dealing with the aftermath of the lockdown announcement yesterday, and there’s a lot more anxiety among the vulnerable young people, and staff too.Our managers need to know where we’re staying, and how long it will take us to get into work in an emergency.We’ve been told we now need to carry ID paperworkwe have to travel.I’m so upset and angry at people getting public transport unnecessarily —I have to travel for work the least people could do is stay home to limit the risk of passing the infection on to key workers.We’re worried because our most vulnerable won’t be able to see us, so we have to give them details on support lines and online information instead.There’s a phrase — ‘flight, fight or freeze’ and unfortunately so far my young people are frozen.They don’t know what to do. I’ve had a phone call from a lad who called up Universal Credit to seehe could get an advance payment but because he’d already had one recently he can’t.He only has £ left on his electric and only has frozen food, so I now need to sort out food parcels and ensure he’s OK.My biggest worry is how the young people I look after with mental health issues will cope with isolation — Ive been calling them everyday and doing what I can.In happy news, following our plea on Facebook for a car seat for the baby due imminently, we got one yesterday, and so many people have also generously made donations sowe have any further emergencies and need to buy any products were covered — it’s uplting to know there are people who want to help.”Kirsty Gage, , is a childminder from Kettering, Northamptonshire. She lives with partner Lewis and their son, Tommy, one.“Usually I take the children to play groups, the library and the park, but under the lockdown we can’t do that so I think cabin fever will be high over the next few weeks.Thankfully I have a garden which is kitted out for the kids but I have some from am to pm and that’s a long time to keep them amused.I’m also limiting the toys because I have to deep clean them every night.Today they have a tray of blocks, a kitchen set, a wooden puzzle, the toys in the garden, and they’ll do painting or drawing.Tonight I’ll put everything in a bath full of Milton sterilising fluid for a deep clean, the blocks will go in the dishwasher and ball pit balls in the washing machine.They bring their own packed lunches so I don’t have to worry about food supplies.Kids are a nightmare with toilet roll – they never use it sparingly – so I’m going to have to be on them, but I have plenty at the moment!My biggest worry is the coronavirus coming into the house.One of my key worker children goes to school and when I picked him up yesterday, he said there were just  kids there.I could see them in the playground and they weren’t being kept apart, they were playing as normal.Today they are joining with the infant school and that will be more kids together, which worries me.I can’t afford not to have him, and his mum needs me to have him, but I am deeply concerned he could bring the coronavirus into the house.”*Names have been changed to protect their identities. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.Boris also announced that gatherings of more than two people would be banned.But it was not clear about whether meeting one friend - such as a partner who lives in another house - would be allowed.The only exceptions that have been revealed so far are for key workers taking their kids to school, or for separated couples taking children to see the other parent.Earlier today No were unable to confirm whether Brits would be able to still see their lovers.It is unclear whether partners would be able to see each otherthey stayed two metres apart, as is the guidance for everyone at the moment unless you share a home.No were today asked specically whether last nights lockdown would mean that boyfriends and girlfriends should not see each other.Downing Street stressed that the rules were clear and that people should only be going out of the house alone, with members of their own live-in family - orit were for work reasons.The PMs spokesperson said this morning: I think the rules are clear in relation to when you are out of the house, only do so with members of your own household orits for work reasons.People should follow rules in a common sense way.I think people should look at guidelines and use their common sense.We are working at pace and as people raise issues we will get clarity for them.Last nights draconian measures which will change every aspect of Brits’ lives included:The police are being given emergency new powers to enforce the draconian bans, initially with on the spot fines of £.Cops will begin issuing them to non-compliers as soon as new laws can be rushed through the Commons, probably by Thursday night. "},{"url":null,"title":"labour called coronavirus great opportunity boris blasted","story":"If you’re one of the London liberal media elite who spend your days scrolling through social media feeds, you’d think most of the country was against his balanced strategy to protect us from the spread of coronavirus without unnecessarily denying our basic freedoms and causing the economy to grind to a halt.In fact, you’d probably believe that Boris was a dithering, dunderhead of a Prime Minister marching the country blindly towards catastrophe.Thank goodness, the great British public are far too sensible to believe the hysterical pundits on Twitter.Here’s the proof: YouGov polling carried out overnight for The Times’ Red Box newsletter shows the British public overwhelmingly supports the leadership provided by the government in the midst of this unprecedented, once-in-a-letime health and economic crisis.And when it comes to the public, party politics has rightly been thrown out the window.An overwhelming  per cent of folk support the lockdown that was announced by Boris last night. That figure includes  per cent of Conservative voters and  per cent of Labour voters.What’s more, only two per cent of the public said they don’t intend to follow the new rules.His personal favourability rating has skyrocketed too.So how has the Prime Minister achieved the type of public support that most leaders during any era of our history could only dream of Because he made it clear he was desperate not to impose these measures.We support Boris introducing draconian rule over our lives now because it’s obvious that doing so is his worst nightmare.He started slowly, initially allowing schools to stay open and football games to still be played based on scientic advice.But as the modelling changed and the threat to le became very real, our willingness to comply dramatically increased too.Only time will tellhe did too much too soon or too little too late. However, I am prepared to say on the record that the measured response was the right one.The British public, who have been brave enough to put their lives and ideology to one side, will be horried to learn that leaders within the Labour party have tried to snf out a political opportunity here.Labour party chairman Ian Lavery has been caught by the Guido Fawkes website plotting to use the coronavirus crisis as what he disgustingly calls a “great opportunity”.He said: “By the way when something like this happens, we’re going to see lots of our own dying as a consequence. But, you know apart from that, it’s going to give the fantastic battalion of Labour Party members, community champions out there a great opportunity of showing how Labour, and why Labour, is best when it gets on the front foot and best when it gets people together. We need to make sure that we do that, and community organising what a great opportunity it’s going to give us.”How revolting.The coronavirus pandemic is not a great political opportunity, Mr Lavery.It’s an international tragedy of epic proportions that will cause grief for many and economic catastrophe for years to come.It’s caused someone I know to lose a dear relative before their time. It’s caused weddings to be cancelled, jobs to be lost and le savings to go down the drain.It’s not a “great opportunity” for anyone – and Lavery should immediately apologise for such a smear.

In Sweden you can not test yourself for Covid- unless you’re in need of emergent medical treatment.Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-, but it’s extremely likely that I’ve had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances.For now she said she had recovered but wanted to warn the younger generation against ignoring warnings about the virus.She said: Manymight not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don’t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups.We who don’t belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the dference between le and death for many others.Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and stay at home to slow the spread of the virus.And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need.Greta also said the swt and far-ranging economic and social shts being brought in to stem the coronavirus pandemic showed rapid action needed to curb climate change was possible.Officials around the world have responded to the growing coronavirus outbreak by shutting businesses, closing schools and other facilities, banning gatherings and travel.Large-scale financial bailouts have also been proposed to keep slowing economies afloat.The coronavirus is a terrible event ... there is no positive to come out of it, the Swedish teenager told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an online interview.But it also shows one thing: That once we are in a crisis, we can act to do something quickly, act fast, said Thunberg, , whose solo school strikes for climate action helped spark a global youth climate strike movement.Though it must be in a dferent way to how we have acted in this case, we can act fast and change our habits and treat a crisis like a crisis.The youth climate strike movement that Thunberg inspired drew millions onto the streets around the world in .This year, however, faced with the emerging pandemic, young Fridays for Future climate activists have taken their weekly actions digital, using the Twitter hashtag #ClimateStrikeOnline.Thunberg urged young climate activists, many now stuck at home as schools close, to help others through the COVID- epidemic and to keep up their activism in safe ways.First of all, right now, we need to help in any way we can and back up society and people in need, she said.In figuring out how to deal with climate change, what we are telling everyone to do is to listen to the experts and listen to the science, and thats what we need to do in this case as well, she said.The virus crisis doesnt mean we need to let go completely of activism, she added. We can do it online and at home.

There is another type from people who were infected in Italy.And there is a third type of virus found in people infected in England.Seven people had attended a football match in England.Tap to see where Covid- is near youThe study has not yet been published, meaning it hasnt yet been analysed by other scientists.Dr Derek Gatherer, an infectious disease specialist at Lancaster University, revealed he was not surprised with the findings.He told the MailOnline: This is much as we would expect. All viruses accumulate mutations, but few of them are of much medical consequence.They are valuable in tracing the origins of infection chains.It looks like Iceland has imported quite a few infections from other European countries.Allan Randrup Thomsen, a virologist from the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at the University of Copenhagen, said the results described by the team make good sense.Professor Thomsen said: Coronavirus is known as a virus that can mutate reasonably violently.We have seen reports of iants from China already. That way, it fits well with what one expects.Earlier this month, researchers in China said they had found two main types of coronavirus could be causing infections.The preliminary study found that when the virus first crossed into humans, the ancestral strain - which they named S - subsequently evolved into another version, called L.In their study, they found that the older strain is the more aggressive and faster-spreading of the two.Initially the newer strain, L, was more prevalent - but is now reducing and S has gone onto become more common.The authors suggest that this could be because the disease it causes is less severe, meaning people can carry it for longer before they are hospitalised - making it the risk of passing it on greater.They also claim that the more aggressive version associated with the disease outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about  per cent of analysed strains.But experts warn that the study is very early data and more research is needed.Similar to the flu, Covid- may be more able to spread and infect more people as it becomes well adapted.However, the iants that cause people to get really sick may die out.Dr Gatherer said this process may take a couple of years.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a good thing to do as people do need telling.“I’m terried of catching it — I’ve been a bit tearful over itI’m honest.“I’m petried as I’ve had health problems — I used to smoke and I was poorly with pneumonia after Christmas.“People shouldn’t be going out and mixing and spreading the disease.

I’m running out of milk so I think I’ll send Wesley down the shops.“ButI have to go out, I have a face mask which I’ll use, I’ll have to go to the cash point to get some money and then head to the supermarket.“People do need to stop panic buying as there is enough for everyone.CORONAVIRUS has stopped Tyrique Smith, , from seeing his girlfriend of three years.Tyrique said: “It’s so frustrating not being able to see my girlfriend as we usually spend a lot of time together.   “I can’t go to the gym anymore, I can’t go to social events to visit my family and friends.

For days everyone has been making virus jokes every time anyone so much as clears their throat, so I am not particularly worried.The cough is so mild it is almost insignicant — coming and going every  minutes or so. Under any normal circumstances, I would ignore it completely. But these are not normal circumstances.With no other symptoms, I start to wondermy cough is born entirely out of corona-paranoia.I don’t have a fever but the government advice is clear and I know I will have to stay inside for seven days.

Now it’s impossible to deny it is both new and continuous. It is a soundtrack that follows me around the flat, where I am working from home.By the afternoon, things have got worse. My whole head is aching and I alternate between shivering with cold and feeling so hot I have to shed multiple layers.I try to carry on as normal. By the end of my sht, I admit defeat and go straight to bed at pm. My jaw, my forehead, every muscle in my shoulders is aching and I can’t seem to stop myself shaking.After a bad night’s sleep, I wake to find I feel, bizarrely . . . fine  My headache has cleared, and while the cough is still there I feel about as well as I did on Tuesday.I feel smug that my immune system seems to have fought it off so quickly. I check in with my mates.Five of us had a final night out on Saturday, two days before the Government advised people to avoid pubs and restaurants.It seems the announcement did not come soon enough. Three are now suffering the same symptoms as me.One pal texts that his cough has gone chesty, another that he feels like his head is stuffed with cotton wool.This virus is a real rollercoaster — and today it s with a vengeance.I’m still coughing away, but worse than that is the feeling of dizziness and total exhaustion.I sit at my computer for an hour attempting to work before I give up and go straight to bed, where I remain prone for the next seven hours.I feel completely deathly at this point. I’m feverish, my head feels like it is filled with pins and needles and every inch of my body aches.I have absolutely zero energy — even going to the bathroom seems to take a superhuman amount of strength. Worst of all, there’s nothing I can take to relieve the pain.We’re out of paracetamol and as my boyfriend has to self-isolate due to my symptoms, there’s no chance of him running out to get some. It sounds like the shops are totally out of it anyway.By the evening, I feel just well enough to sit up in bed and FaceTime my mum.She immediately puts her entire supply of paracetamol in the post, and asks my sister to do the same. The drugs drop can’t come soon enough.My temperature feels more normal. I still feel pretty weak and pathetic, and commute from the bed to the sofa for a busy day of watching telly and playing Bananagrams with my boyfriend.With our food supplies running low, our neighbours have kindly agreed to pick up some essentials. We ask for milk, bread and eggs.An hour later, and there’s a bottle of milk left outside our door — but they text to say they went to multiple shops and bread and eggs are sold out everywhere.By the evening, I’m starting to feel more like myself. We dial in for a Zoom video chat session with our mates.It’s not quite the same as a night at the pub — especially as three of us contribute mainly coughing.I’ve stopped coughing! In fact, I feel pretty much back to normal, although my chest still feels a little tight.I’ve also lost my appetite — highly unusual for me — but that is probably because I haven’t left the flat or done any kind of exercise for the best part of a week.My boyfriend has also managed to avoid getting symptoms.

Today, Britain’s most respected doctor answers questions about what you should and shouldn’t do ­during the lockdown to safeguard your health…Q: I’M separated from my partner. We have children together and they split their time between both our homes. Is it safe for our children to still move between homes A: IT is important that children can see both their parents but, of course, the more travelling they do then the more dferent contacts they have and the greater the risk of transmission. So it still needs to be kept to a minimum.Q: I SUFFER from mild asthma but have not had an attack for many years. Should I be self-isolating A: PEOPLE with asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from coronavirus and are therefore in the at-risk group. But there are iable degrees of asthma.Some people may have had an attack three years ago and nothing since and some people’s asthma is well controlled with medication so they are not really vulnerable.If in your case getting a cold or cough usually triggers an asthma attack then you are vulnerable.It is important you practise social distance, avoid having ­visitors and work from home where possible.Q: I’M over , but am fit and healthy. Owing to my age, I have been told to self-isolate but I am unable to get an online shopping delivery. Is it safe for me to still go out A: IF you cannot get a relative, friend or neighbour to shop for you then you can go out to get essential shopping.But as you are in the at-risk group make sure you don’t come within two metres of other people, ensure your trip is kept as short as possible and stock up on items to last you seven to ten days.Q: MY we is in the high-risk group, meaning people at a higher risk of severe illnessthey contract coronavirus. Does she need to self-isolate from me and can I still go out to do our shopping A: SHE doesn’t need to self-isolate from you but be extra cautious. You can still go out to do your essential shopping and collect medication as well as taking your daily exercise.Remember to take all the necessary ­precautions, such as keeping a two metre distance from other people and thoroughly washing your hands as soon as youhome so you reduce the risk of bringing the virus home to the person at risk.Q: I HAVE had an online grocery delivery. Should I be worried about the virus being on the packaging and should I wash fresh produce like fruit A: WHEN any packages arrive take the contents out, throw away the packages and wash your hands.Coronavirus does not live within food, but it makes sense to wash fresh fruit and veg under the tap, peel fruit before eating it and cook vegetables as you would normally do, as cooking would kill the virus easily.Wash your hands again after preparing food.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Q: MY sister is due to have a final fitting of dentures at the dentist. Is it OK for her to go A: DENTISTS have now been given clear guidance in cancelling all dental treatments unless they are emergencies.This is because any close contact with people’s mouths and throats and even their breathing would be high-risk exposure to any virus present.Q I LIVE with my nan who is  and my mum who is . I work in a primary school and my mum works in a hospital. I am worried we are both going out to work and we are going to bring the virus home. Should we still be working while living with my nan A: YOUR nan’s age puts her in the at-risk group and she has to be careful about contact with others.This, however, does not include you and your mum as you live in the same household and currently have no symptoms.You should, however, physically distance yourself from your Nan, who should have no other visitors.If you or your mum did develop symptoms you would need to self-isolate well away from your Nan or see whether other ­members of the family could take her in temporarily.Q: MY daughter believes she may have had this virus about three weeks ago but isn’t sure. Is there a test she should be taking to seeshe has had this virus and is now well A: A TEST to find out whether somebody has had the virus, has recovered and is therefore now immune will be a game-changer. Such a test exists and will become available in the future to many more people.However, it is essential that healthcare professionals are tested first so we can discover whether they are immune and can therefore come back to working with patients safely.It will take time to produce enough tests for everyone.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no.You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.No still couldnt confirm whether one person could meet another one person.Downing Street stressed that no one should be leaving their homes unless they had to anyway.Experts told lovers today thatthey wanted to see each other during the lockdown they should move in with each other - and stay there.Brits wont be allowed in and out of each others homes as they would risk spreading the virus.It is unclear whether partners would be able to see each otherthey stayed two metres apart, as is the guidance for everyone at the moment unless you share a home.No were today asked specically whether the lockdown would mean that boyfriends and girlfriends should not see each other.Downing Street stressed that the rules were clear and that people should only be going out of the house alone, with members of their own live-in family - orit were for work reasons.The PMs spokesperson said: I think the rules are clear in relation to when you are out of the house, only do so with members of your own household orits for work reasons.Boris said everyone who could work from home should be doing so.But there was confusion about exactly which businesses would be shutting and which would stay open.Sadiq Khan said construction workers in the capital should NOT go into work, but Michael Gove said earlier they could as long as they stayed a safe distance apart.No has said anyone who can work at home must do so, and avoid public transport. This includes all workers in an office based situation.If they absolutely have to go in to do their job, they are allowed to do so, but must stay at least two metres apart from other colleagues.This will include people working in factories, for example, who cant work from home.Work meetings are allowed, even though they break the gatherings rule.Again, people must stay a safe distance apart.To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.     Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He also said the PM slapped him down during a meeting on whether builders should go to work.Mr Hancock put the onus on bosses to keep their workers safe, saying: “In work, in many, many instances, the two-metre rule can be applied. Employers have a duty to ensure workers are two metres apart.”It came as Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley tried to keep stores open — then pushed up prices. His group told staff its fitness ranges made it a vital asset.But it later announced that its shops would close.Ashley’s stores had hiked prices by more than  per cent on some goods. Sports Direct blamed lack of clarity for the shops fiasco, and supply problems for the rises.Meanwhile, Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin told staff to “go work at Tesco” instead as the pub firm warned they could face delays over pay.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But as the disease relentlessly spreads and deaths soar, it will not cope without a monumental national effort of a kind not seen for  years.The exhausted doctors and nurses on the frontline, dealing with stricken or recovering patients, now need the support of an army of , volunteers. If you are in good health and unable to work, why not join them It has been moving beyond measure to witness the , retired or former medics, nurses and pharmacists rejoining the NHS to fight this disease.They could be safe at home. Instead they have put themselves in harm’s way. That takes great courage and public spirit. MPs may not be popular these days, but those workers include Tory Maria Caulfield and Labour’s Dr Rosena Allin-Khan. We salute both.And we wish luck to the , final-year doctors and , student nurses who, at the very start of their careers, are tasked with tackling the gravest public health crisis in a century.They and all their colleagues should know, from the thousands of “I Love NHS” messages pouring into us from Sun readers, how grateful the nation is.Millions are doing their bit just by staying home. Many are going the extra mile to help friends, neighbours and OAPs who are self-isolating. Some, with their own jobs in peril, have poured money into good causes close to ruin.For their part, some of our businesses are repurposing factories to produce ventilators and other vital supplies.Now, the Government is asking every one of us to volunteer for the NHSwe can. Together we can help the health service beat this virus and restore some semblance of normality while minimising casualties. And it is desperately urgent.As the latest heartbreaking death toll shows, this crisis is likely to get much worse before it gets better. THE eerie, deserted streets tell their own story. Britain has begun to listen and obey.More than  million of us watched Boris Johnson’s stark, historic address to the nation — among the highest TV audience figures ever. And it hit home.Yes, there were still some crammed carriages on London’s depleted Tube yesterday. There is still confusion over some of the guidance and rules — and more clarity would be welcome.But there WILL be mistakes and inconsistencies from the Government. It is having to react minute by minute to a sudden, global catastrophe. It cannot cover off every inidual situation. We all have to use our common sense too.The vast majority of people get that. They back the PM and the lockdown and are grimly but calmly sticking by it.We are reacting with fortitude. Let’s keep that going.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We were high on euphoria and expectation before the inevitable responsibilities and occasional disappointments of adult le set in.For me, it meant a week in Tywyn, Wales, in the caravan of my friend Mandy’s mum and dad, followed by a summer job in Littlewoods and Sundays spent hanging around the local rec with my mates while passing round a warm, spittle-filled bottle of budget cider.Ah, those were the days. Today’s kids are more likely to be drinking canned Pinot Grigio at an American-style prom party before heading off on a family holiday to Spain, but the sense of closure they feel at the end of exams is exactly the same. It’s a rite of passage.So for all those GCSE and A-level students for whom Covid- has put paid to that “end of exams” feeling, I have nothing but the utmost sympathy.Last Wednesday I was on a dog walk with my youngestwhen news came in that her GCSEs were off.It’s tempting to think that she and the rest of Class  might have whooped with joy at this unprecedented cancellation of national exams, but that would be to sorely underestimate the level of pressure placed on their generation to get a qualication that will elevate them out of the in-tray of le and into paid employment.Like the Olympic athletes who’ve spent the past few years training for that one event in Tokyo that has been postponed until next year, our kids have been preparing for exams that their parents and teachers have drummed into them are so critically important to their future.So forgive them , despite the deaths that give perspective to the little things that many of us find frustrating about this plague on all our houses, they allow themselves a spell of feeling deeply sorry for themselves.They will now be given “predicted” grades — though the Government is still frustratingly vague on the exact detail of how they will be decided upon.There has been some suggestion that mock results might be a factor but, let’s face it, they’re rarely taken seriously at the time and never match the grades kids get in the real thing. So let’s hope they come up with something fairer.Either way, it’s going to be potentially fraught with pitfalls.“I wanted to earn my grades,” the youngest said, plaintively, the other day. “Now I feel like all my hard work has been for nothing.”I reassured her that, one day, knowledge such as “changes to Tanzania’s economy through private and foreign investment” , “the formation of polyesters through the reaction between dicarboxylic acid monomers and diol monomers”and “parallel and collinear vectors”might come in handy when, ten years from now, she’s at a pub quiz. Or maybe not.Which brings me to my final point on this unprecedented cancellation of GCSEs and A-levels.The latter are fine as they are, but perhaps those in the upper echelons of education could use this time of isolation to take a long, hard look at GCSEs and whether they are fit for purpose in the modern world Most kids know their subject strengths and weaknesses by the time they’re  so, aside from basic maths and English, which prove useful whatever your chosen employment, do they really need their heads crammed with often obscure information that,needed in later le, they could simply look up on Google Better, surely, to teach them vital le skills such as entrepreneurialism, money management, how to compose an impressive CV and do well in job interviews Like a reverse version of a minute’s silence, it’s to show our hard-working NHS staff how much we appreciate their efforts at this deeply challenging time.So whether you do it in a garden balcony windowbox or post it live on social media, put your hands together and show that we care about them too.MADONNA has posted an, er, inspirational Instagram video of herself ponticating on the Covid- plague while luxuriating in a bath full of rose petals.Her Madgeness declares: “That’s the thing about Covid-. It doesn’t care about how rich you are, how famous you are, how funny you are, how smart you are, where you live, how old you are, what amazing stories you can tell.“It’s the great equaliser and what’s terrible about it is what’s great about it.”Hmmmm. Nice sentiment, but the reality of self-isolation for the majority brings to mind the famous quote from George Orwell’s Animal Farm. “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.”Be it the Queen Of Pop, with her vast mansion and multi-million dollar nest egg to see her through these trying times, or The Queen with her “skeleton staff of eight” – being in lockdown is far nicer when you’re wealthy.But when there’s loads of you in a pokey space and with no discernible means of paying next month’s rent, it’s not so “great”. GOVERNMENT advice on who should be doing what and when is still a little woolly.And where there’s potential loopholes there are those who will either misunderstand or willfully exploit them.Step forward Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley who, post-lockdown, told his staff they should turn up for work before being publicly shamed in to telling them to stay home after all.But with cycle shops being allowed to stay open, he could perhaps mitigate that as he’s in the business of sports equipment, he thought the same rule applied to his business too.­Similarly, while the building work on one house near me has ceased, another is still ongoing with at least eight construction workers – all of whom will have either shared a van or taken public transport to get there.So one suspects the Government is going to have to ramp up the “lockdown” rhetoric to make it clearer exactly what is deemed essential and what’s not.Meanwhile, I’m going to exploit this small pocket of vagueness by hopping on my bike and heading to the local pharmacy for a packet of hair dye, not least because it comes with a handy pair of disposable gloves.As the Donald Trump meme shows above, no one wants to see that much harsh reality.THE closure of McDonald’s prompted s of people to queue round the block for one last Big Mac.They shouldn’t worry.Given that a man in Utah claims to own the world’s oldest McDonald’s burgerand it shows no sign of decay.All those desperate McAddicts could have bought  of them and they’d still be edible at Christmas.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Retired geophysicist and grandad-of-four Steve Meadows, , on holiday with -year-old we Pauline said: “We’re trapped and getting more and more anxious about getting home now.“I’m not sure we’ll make it home unless the UK sends a relief flight because commercial routes back are all shut down.

Concerned workers have complained that they are being told to still come into work despite government advice being to work from home where posssible. Some trains on Londonaposs Tube network were crowded again on Tuesday morning despite Boris Johnson placing the UK on a police-enforced lockdown with drastic new measures in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak. The Prime Minister ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops. But police chiefs warned of phone lines being inundated with calls on Monday night with questions about what movements are still permitted, while MPs also called for answers. And the construction industry has been singled out - with people ided onmuch of the work which is happening at the moment is truly essential. In Downing Staposs daily briefing Matt Hancock said: Of courseyou’re in a workplace we’ve said will close we’re going to enforce against those closures as well. But he did not say whether workers whose workplaces are not shut down can refuse to come in,theyaposre not personally ill. And he defended the governmentaposs policy. Matt Hancock said: “The judgement we have made is in work, in many many instances, the  metre rule can be applied. In my workplace in the House of Commons you can see it every day “Where possible people should work from home”. But he added “employers have a duty to ensure people are more than  metres apart.” Mr Hancock appeared to try and sht the blame for images on full tubes to Transport for London - who have cut tube numbers in the last few day. He said there should be more London Underground trains running.  He said: When it comes to the tube, the first and the best answer is that Transport for London should have the tube running in full so that people travelling on the tube are spaced out and can be further apart - obeying the two-metre rule wherever possible. And there is no good reason in the information that Iaposve seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are. We should have more tube trains running. But a spokesman for the mayor of London hit back. They said: This is simply not true. The mayor has told ministers countless times over recent days that TfL simply cannot safely run a full service because of the levels of staff sickness and self-isolation. Nearly a third of staff are already absent - there aren’t enough drivers and control staff to do it. The government must act urgently to get more people staying at home rather than going to work unnecessarily - that means taking the dficult decisions they are refusing to take to ban non-essential construction work and provide proper financial support to freelancers, the self employed and those on zero hours contracts to stay at home. The government says people should not go into work in person unless it is absolutely necessary. But unless a firm has been forcibly shut down, the definition of “necessary” is being left up to employers to work out. In these firms, bosses are free to continue asking you to come to work. However, new rules were due to be issued on Tuesday to cover firms whose workers are still going in despite the lockdown.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the rules would include a requirement on employers to keep workers  metres from each other. There will be unlimited fines for non compliance though they start at £, he said. Construction firms should also use “common sense” to ensure that distance is maintained, the government said. For instance large-scale construction sites have been told to go ahead - but domestic home extensions should be put on hold.

The advice is likely to prompt a furious new row over the lack of protection for self-employed people amid the pandemic. Millions of peopleaposs jobs in pubs, bars, hotels and non-essential shops have been shut down as a result of the Covid- pandemic.Yet the government has still not come forward with extra support for the self-employed, who are left claiming Universal Creditthey are out of work. Chancellor Rishi Sunak is working on a package to be announced later this week. Todayaposs government guidance says: Work carried out in people’s homes, for example by tradespeople carrying out repairs and maintenance, can continue, provided that the tradesperson is well and has no symptoms. Tradespeople are advised to keep a two-metre distance between themselves and anyone in the home. Todayaposs official advice appears to contradict what Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said  hours earlier. Mr Gove said on Tuesday: “If it is the case you are reconstructing or building a home in which there is no one present, that is appropriate and it can go on. “Butwe’re talking about the sort of construction work that involves a builder coming into home in order to deliver an extension or something like that, that would seem not appropriate and not in line with the clear guidance.”  It comes as Boris Johnson is under growing pressure to stop non-essential workers heading into work. The Prime Minister has faced calls from across the political spectrum for more stringent rules so workers are not placed at risk, and public transport is not overwhelmed. Mr Johnson, who will appear before MPs on Wednesday for Prime Ministeraposs Questions in the Commons, has so far resisted the pressure. And last night Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the governmentaposs policy. He said: “The judgement we have made is in work, in many many instances, the -metre rule can be applied. In my workplace in the House of Commons you can see it every day. The governmentaposs new guidance on tradesmen says work can continueneither the worker nor the householder is self-isolating due to coronavirus. It adds no work should be done in the homes of the .million most at risk people who the NHS has told inidually to stay in their homes for  weeks. The guidance says: It will be important to ensure that Public Health England guidelines, including maintaining a two metre distance from any household occupants, are followed to ensure everyone’s safety.No work should be carried out in any household which is isolating or where an inidual is being shielded, unless it is to remedy a direct risk to the safety of the household, such as emergency plumbing or repairs, and where the tradesperson is willing to do so. In such cases, Public Health England can provide advice to tradespeople and households. No work should be carried out by a tradesperson who has coronavirus symptoms, however mild.

Yet manual workers like builders, plumbers and electricians are still being told to go into work, even where there work is not essential to the running of the country. The Coronavirus Bill will give police powers to fine people £, for not taking a coronavirus test and keep them in quarantine for a month. It allows mentally ill people to be detained or dead people to be medically certied on the opinion of just one doctor. Sweeping powers will force supermarkets to disclose any problems in the food supply or be fined % of their turnover.

Just days ago a Cabinet minister told the Mirror Parliament would be the last place to close down due to the coronavirus. If Parliament shuts, the UK shuts, they said.But the landscape has changed dramatically over the past week after Boris Johnson imposed a dramatic lockdown and banned gatherings of two or more in public.Downing Street press conferences and Cabinet meetings have been stripped back to a video link, MPs have maintained a two-metre separation in the Commons, and committee hearings have in many cases been cancelled. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said select committees will continue to be able to scrutinise the Government eventhey do not enter the parliamentary estate. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: Parliament willafter the Easter break in the usual way. Thereaposs been another order in Parliament to create ways for select committees for example to operate remotely. So I think innovation will happen to make it possible for MPs to hold us to account.  Yet many non-essential workers such as those in construction are still being told to go into work. And today the government told electricians and plumbers they could continue work in private homes - as long as neither they nor the household are self-isolating. Boris Johnson is under growing pressure to stop non-essential construction workers heading to building sites as the country attempts to tackle the spread of coronavirus.

Mr Johnson, who will appear before MPs on Wednesday for Prime Ministeraposs Questions in the Commons, has so far resisted the pressure.  In measures announced on Monday, the PM told people to only go to workabsolutely necessary. But on Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said those who cannot work from home, including key workers in the NHS and social care, should go to work to keep the country running. The Health Secretary said construction workers were among those who could continue to work as long as they could remain two metres apart at all times.

Named the Nightingale Hospital and established with the help of the military, its presence underlines the fact that this is a war against a silent enemy which strikes unseen until it is too late to escape. Boris Johnson and the Tory Government were criminally slow to respond to the threat but there is a faint hope that the National Health Service is fighting back, bolstered by medical volunteers and recently retired staff. The country is crying out for strong leadership yet the Prime Minister has been unable to persuade people to shun social contact, the only way of halting the spread of the virus. Mixed messages and an absence of clarity from the top are fatal weaknesses. As is the failure to include the self-employed and freelancers in wage protection schemes so they are not forced to go to work, risking their and our lives to earn a living. The construction workers crowding into packed London Underground trains are turning the carriages into breeding grounds.  We can win this new Battle of Britain but there will be tens of thousands of casualties. Each and every one of us has a responsibility to look after ourselves and others but the absence of certainty from the top at Downing Street is risking lives. Horrible bosses When this crisis is over the day of reckoning must include judgement on tycoons Tim Martin and Mike Ashley.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailIn the last few days, really big changes have been made to how we all live our lives. Boris Johnson last night ordered people only to leave their homes under a list of very limited purposes, banned public gatherings of more than two people and ordered the closure of non-essential shops.  The Government has changed how we are supposed to access services, who can and cannot go to school and hundreds of other things in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-. Predictably this has led to lots and lots of questions - because real le is often complicated in a way which is dficult for even the best-intentioned civil servant to imagine. So we asked you what questions you wanted to be answered and set about trying to get to the bottom of your query.We didnapost get answers to them all - and no doubt people will have a lot more in the next few days. So these answers are up to date as of pm on Tuesday, March . But things will change in the coming days as the Government continues to review its response to the coronavirus crisis. Can I move house  There is no government ban on moving house, and vehicle hire services remain open. But a Cabinet minister advised to postpone ityou can. Michael Gove accepted there will be “specic circumstances” where the process is already under way, meaning people continue to buy or sell homes amid the pandemic. But he suggested a “pause”possible adding: “If at all possible, people should stay in their current home.”  Can I still play golf  No. “I don’t think people should be playing golf,” minister Michael Gove said. Clubhouses are likely to be shut anyway. He said people should define exercise specically as “one walk, one run or one cycle per day”.Can I still go to my allotment  Yes. Michael Gove said: “I think it’s perfectly sensible for people to go to an allotment. It’s in the very nature of allotments that there’s a safe distance between people who are working on an inidual allotment.” Is there a limit on how long my daily walk can be  No, but people are asked to use common sense. Cabinet minister Michael Gove said: “People can go for the standardof run or walk that they ordinarily would have done. The important thing is once per day.”  Are over s allowed out to shop  Yes, but try to avoid it. Over-s may go out to buy essentialsabsolutely necessary, but they are in an “at-risk” group. This means they should take even greater care to stay indoors than most people and,they can, ask a friendly neighbour or family member to drop food at the door instead. However, the government is not explicitly telling all over-s to stay indoors at all times no matter what. That instruction has gone only to those who are either in a household with symptoms, or one of the .million most at risk people . Can I still deliver food to relatives or volunteer for strangers  Yes. Cabinet minister Michael Gove said dropping food at vulnerable people’s doors “is an appropriate activity”. He added: “Making sure the vulnerable receive the support they need is absolutely critical.”  What happensI get ‘caught’ in a group of more than two  People gathering in groups of more than two can be handed a £ fixed penalty notice by police - which can rise and lead to a criminal convictionunpaid. The exception isyou’re in the same household. It’s still unclear how this will be policed exactly.  Am I allowed to go to banks and post offices  Boris Johnson said pretty clearly that people are to go shopping for essential foods, medical appointments or shopping or to help or care for the vulnerable. But what about banks  They remain open, but are you allowed to go Yes. People may go “infrequently” to these placesit is “essential”, for instance posting legal papers or essential financial work. A No spokesman told us: “The businesses that were left open were on the basis that they are providing essential services to the public. The reasons for that speak for themselves. We’ve set out that people should leave the housethey need to collect items infrequently.”  Can I get petrol and an MOT on my car  Yes - for petrol, see above but bear in mind you shouldnapost be making any non-essential travel at all including in the UK. For MOTs, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agencyhas said it is keeping the situation under review. But for the moment, cars, motorbikes, light vans will still need a valid MOT. Garages were specically excluded from those businesses that had to close, but you should check with your local mechanic about what their opening hours are. The DVSA has suspended testing of all heavy goods vehicles , trailers and public service vehiclesfor up to three months and said it is keeping testing of other vehicles under review. Can I drive to collect someone from the airport  There is no restriction on collecting people from the airport specically, but everyone has been asked to avoid all non-essential travel.  Picking up someone from the airport can fall into the category of essential travel - but it might be advisable to bring proof of their flight in case you are asked about your journey. I don’t live with my boyfriend or girlfriend - can I visit them   It seems not. Brits should not visit their boyfriendaposs or girlfriendaposs housethey donapost live together, Downing Street said. The governmentaposs rules explicitly say: You should be ensuring you are  metres apart from anyone outside of your household. Downing Street said: The guidance was clear yesterday. Essentially, what it said was that you should stay at home, and then it just set out four very specic circumstances where you may be permitted to go outdoors. And I think those rules should be applied to all scenarios. The exceptions are key workers taking kids to school, or split parents with shared custody iding time with kids. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer today confirmed boyfriends and girlfriends who live apart should stay apart. But she did offer a silver lining - saying lovers can move in with each other full-time and stay therethey want to take the plunge.  Why are warehouse and construction workers still having to go into work  Because the government has decided to let some people who aren’t “key workers” keep going into work. The government says people should not go into work in person unless it is absolutely necessary. But unless a firm has been forcibly shut down, the definition of “necessary” is being left up to employers to work out. In these firms, bosses are free to continue asking you to come to work. However, new rules were due to be issued on Tuesday to cover firms whose workers are still going in despite the lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the rules would include a requirement on employers to keep workers  metres from each other. There will be unlimited fines for non compliance though they start at £, he said. Construction firms should also use “common sense” to ensure that distance is maintained, the government said. For instance large-scale construction sites have been told to go ahead - but domestic home extensions should be put on hold.  I work for an office relocation company. We are being told that clearing a building of desks, pens, chairs etc is an essential job. I disagree. How do I find out where we stand as I feel our health is being ignored  It seems this is a grey area. As above, firms can still ask workers to come in - even non key workers -it is “absolutely necessary” for them to be there in person. We asked Downing Streetworkers can refuse to go in - and didn’t get a clear answer. Instead, Boris Johnson’s spokesman said: “I think our guidance in relation to anybody who fears they may have symptoms or anybody in their house might have symptoms is very clear. We need people to stay at home because ultimately that will save lives.” Asked again, he said: “Well, the list of sectors in which we don’t consider to be essential was spelled out very clearly in the guidance we published last night. That was a direct instruction from the government and we would expect employers to adhere to it.” But No did not say what happens for firms that haven’t been told to shut down. I am an administrator for the NHS. I have equipment and access to systems and can easily work from home, but my manager insists I go to work. Where do I stand  Can I refuse  See above - this is not black-and-white. We are told it would be a discussion between the inidual and the employer . Government guidance says you should work from homeyou can, soyou believe that is the case, keep pressing it with your manager. Escalate it to the HR departmentneeds be. There may be a good reason for you being there in person ask what it is. Can my separated partner and I still share custody of our kids  Yes. Children under  are still allowed to travel between both of their parents’ homes, minister Michael Gove claried - moments after he said the exact opposite. However, he said moving between households in this case should be kept to a minimum.  Why hasnapost everyone received a government text  I have not received one, yet my we has The UKaposs mobile networks are sending out a Government message to their customers with details of the new shutdown measures. It reads: “GOV.UK CORONAVIRUS ALERT. New rules in force now: you must stay at home. More info and exemptions at gov.uk coronavirus Stay at home. Protect the NHS. Save lives.” But not all customers have already received the message yet. That is because mobile operators are sending them out in batches - because the network can become overwhelmed. O told the BBC it was sending the texts in batches adding it could take until :GMT to complete the task. My  year old mother needs a prescription for insulin in the next few days, and canapost get through to GP surgery. What do we do  Government guidance is clear GPs should be able to process prescriptions over the phone and they should be staying open for this purpose - but they will be busier than usual. Check their website or social media pages for any details about when they are open or any dficulties they are experiencing. Keep trying - and in the meantime try contacting your MP for help in getting through to the surgery. In the meantime in an emergency pharmacists are permitted to supply insulin - but only in the  only the smallest pack size available. So consider calling themthe situation doesn’t improve. Why do renters have to accrue debt, while homeowners get a three month mortgage holiday  The short answer is because that is the way the government has structured its support. It’s a political decision but ministers have said they keep the situation under review. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick last week said: “The government is clear – no renter who has lost income due to coronavirus will be forced out of their home, nor will any landlord face unmanageable debts.” In short it means that private tenants will not be evicted from their homes for at least three months. Households and families could see their Council Tax bills slashed by £ as councils look to support those who fall into aposvulnerableapos groups. Anyone who receives Council Tax Support will be eligible for help.  Will employers pay the extra cost of utilities for those working from home  There are no Government instructions to force your employer to help you pay the cost of working from home. Meaning any arrangement would have to be struck between you and your employer. That doesn’t mean  there is no help available. If you need to pay for stuff like office chairs, desks the taxman can help ease the burden slightly. You will need to fill out a P form, which you can do so long as you have spent your own money on expenses that have not been reimbursed andyour allowable employment expenses are less than £, for the tax year. HMRC guidance stipulates you can claim relief for items aposwholly, exclusively and necessarilyapos in the performance of your employment role. Important note - you can only make a P claimyou and your employer have agreed that you have to work from home.

The likes of Tesco and Sainsburyaposs say it is becoming increasingly dficult to book a delivery slot within  hours as people rush to use their online click and collect options.

The archbishops and bishops of the Church of England have written collectively to clergy, through their dioceses, urging them now to close all church buildings - other than where they are needed to keep a foodbank running, but even then under strict limits. There will be no church weddings until further notice funerals will not take place inside church buildings and the only baptisms will be emergency baptisms in a hospital or home. It follows the announcement by the Prime Minister last night of wide-ranging restrictions as part of a national and international effort to help limit the spread of the disease. “These are unprecedented times,” the bishops write.

Clergy live-streaming worship should do so from their own homes and are being urged to be as creative as possible with streaming services and other resources. “We must take a lead in showing our communities how we must behave in order to slow down the spread of the Coronavirus. “We must also do all that we can to provide resources and support for those who are isolated, fearful and vulnerable. “But we have to do this from our homes.” The Church of England will be offering a national weekly service which will be broadcast online each Sunday via social media and daily audio of prayer during the day and night prayer will also be available.  This is in addition to a wide range of resources local churches are sharing. An five million people heard or saw a service led by the Archbishop of Canterbury streamed online and broadcast through dozens of radio stations on Sunday – the largest single ‘congregation’ in the history of the Church of England. The bishops add: “It is also imperative that as the Church of Jesus Christ, called to offer hope and light in the darkness of this world’s ills, we maintain a praying presence for our community, though from today onwards this must happen from our hearts and from our homes.

A professor of infectious diseases told the PA news agency the risk of transmission in this way is low and people should simply employ common sense. Stephen Baker, from the Department of Medicine at the University of Cambridge, said viruses - unlike bacteria - do not survive well outside the body. The NHS websiteaposs coronavirus page says: Itaposs very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food. Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror   The key thing to remember is that the biggest risk of transmission is from person to person, which is why social distancing measures are vital in slowing the spread.How much risk is posed by packaging from supermarkets and deliveries Prof Baker said the risk is not zero when it comes to supermarket and home food deliveries, but it is relatively minor.  He said it is not possible for every piece of food to be decontaminated by a supermarket, but whilst the risk, I would say, is not zero, itaposs pretty, pretty small. Prof Baker said bread taken from a supermarket shelf should go into a bag straight away, and recommended washing fresh fruit and vegetables as normal. Things that are in packages, I would maintain a degree of common sense with the view that they are unlikely to make anybody sick, he said, adding that wet wipes or alcohol wipes can be usedthere are any concerns.Does the virus live on food Prof Baker said that while the virus will survive on food as it would do on other surfaces, it then dies off. He said the virus cannot replicate or produce more copies of itself on food. The professor said it is dficult to predict how long it would survive on dferent foods, but added: There is no reason to think the virus would be able to survive on food longer than any other surface. Prof Baker said the risk posed by ingesting food contaminated with small amounts of the virus would be really low.How should people interact with delivery workers  Prof Baker said the important thing to remember is social distancing, and suggested that deliveries could be left at peopleaposs doors to cut down on direct contact. Paying by debit card in advance is sensible as it removes the direct contact of a cash payment.Should packaging be disposed of quickly   Prof Baker said the virus will survive for a period of time on packaging, but not indefinitely. I think that we canapost get to the point where weaposre disinfecting every item we come in contact with. I would say there isnapost any real necessity to throw away packaging any sooner than you would do normally, he said.Is hand washing still important and what other surfaces should people be concerned about Yes.

The man, from Glasgow, fell ill after his we came home from a holiday to Dubai on Saturday March , suffering with symptoms of the virus. He didnapost want to be named, but the -year-old reveals in a diary on how he has coped with the disease and what symptoms he has experienced. Although the couple have not been tested, doctors said itaposs likely they have it and have ordered them to self-isolate. This is what M* told GlasgowLive. Day : Saturday   My we flew home on a long-haul flight through one of the worldaposs busiest airports, so the possibility of exposure had of course crossed my mind. She came off the flight feeling okay but REALLY hot. She insisted she felt fine and the flight had just been really warm, and that everyone had said so. She seemed to cool down by the time we got home so thought she was okay. Day : Monday Two days later, M woke up with really painful, aching muscles, a very sore throat and he was told to work from home by his boss. A couple of hours later, his condition worsened. I was feeling like flu coming on, headachey, feeling really hot or having bad chills, the muscle pain spreading up round neck and shoulders and really bad on chest. I checked my temperature a few times and each time it came up normal. I also couldnapost really smell or taste anything. After calling NHS  and checking their advice online, his symptoms were not consistent with the ones outlined online. He said: My symptoms didnapost match the two criteria for coronavirus. I didnapost have a continuous fever or cough. There was an overwhelming feeling of confusion. The most common symptoms of the coronavirus are: a dry, persistent cougha feverIf you experience these symptoms, you should immediately self-isolate yourself for seven days. It is not necessary to call NHS  unless your symptoms get more severe. Some patients have reported fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath and aches and pains. Sneezing is not a symptom of the coronavirus. There was no advice on any way to get tested and find out, just to isolate. It felt surreal and made us question whether we were overreacting, and also feel a little lost. Weaposd heard so much about how serious this could be, yet now we MAY have it, rather than being offered testing and treatment advice or support, the advice was isolation and ultimately to go to hospitalwe had issues breathing. Obviously we didnapost even consider that. He added: By that night –  hours from exposure - I was exhausted, but every time I fell asleep I woke up after  or  minutes, having crazy feverish dreams and feeling fuzzy asIaposd been asleep for days. This went on all night. The muscle pains were getting worse and worse. Day : Tuesday   M said that it was around  hours in that he was convinced he and his we were suffering from coronavirus. He struggled to sleep through the agony of severe muscle pain, leg cramps and felt extremely feverish and lethargic. I was so weak, moving at all seemed impossible. I was burning hot then freezing cold, then both at once. I had the most insane thirst, no matter how much I drank it felt like it had no effect. My skin felt really tender and sensitive and painful to touch, all over, and I had a deep, sharp stomach ache not really like anything Iaposd felt before. Eating was out of the question, just unthinkable. The overall weakness was probably the scariest part. The hardest to cope with was the intense, constant muscle pain. This was like nothing Iaposd experienced before. You know when you get a cramp in your leg  That agonising pain, but rather than a brief sharp spike there all the time. All over.  There were moments when he thought he was on the mend throughout each day - only for his condition to worsen later. There would be a little lull at some point where youaposd feel like it was going away, then bang, back it came but worse. Tuesday evening was the first time I registered a high temperature - .. Again to be clear, this was the first time I took a reading which confirmed a fever. Day : Wednesday On day five since he was exposed, M recalls Wednesday being very up and down after another night of broken sleep. I would fall into a deep sleep which was very hard to wake from. Once Iaposm awake, I usually canapost fall asleep again but I was passing out for hours through the day. Iaposve never felt tiredness like this. Battling to wake up and being pulled back under into a weird deep sleep that felt like unconsciousness somehow.He added: I was still feeling crap but definitely a little better than the hell of Tuesday so I thought I was over the worst. A good thing was seeing a thread on Twitter with a Corona sufferer, Jamie East, tweeting his symptoms, which were very similar to mine, so it was reassuring to hear someone going through something similar rather than the standard cough temperature official line. Also I was able to eat again, on and off. Day : Thursday   His brief respite didnapost last long, however. His symptoms worsened to the degree he seriously considered going to hospital. Thursday was even worse than Tuesday, he admitted. I woke up with really intense pain on the left side of my chest, which switched to the right then back and forth over a few hours, before settling across my whole chest. It felt like a weight was resting on my chest and I could not take a full deep breath. As the day went on, it became a band around my back and chest, getting tighter and tighter, accompanied by a stabbing pain in my chestI moved or tried to breathe deeply. Getting up to get a drink left me totally panting and breathless like Iaposd just been running. I was trying to fill my lungs, but they would fill so much, then it was just like I was inhaling but no air was coming in, and the chest pain would intensy. I still felt like I didnapost want to over-react, so I saidit got worse on Friday Iaposd go to hospital. I also felt confused and forgetful at times but only really realised this the next day. Day : Saturday Maposs condition improved again on Saturday, and he found it was easier to breathe despite suffering chest pain. I was having more spells of feeling a little better, then slumping again after waking late afternoon. The weakness and tiredness were still really bad.Day : Sunday M slept until pm on Sunday and he woke up feeling flat, weak and fluey. My chest felt less tight though. I was thinking about getting back to work, evenfrom home, and sure I was getting over it.  He added: Then the chest pain intensied, the tight feeling stopping me taking a deep breath came back. My positive feeling drained away and instead of thinking about work I was instead thinking Iaposd go to hospitalthe breathing dficulties got worse overnight. M admits he still didnapost know whether his condition was severe enough to go to hospital. Yes, my chest was tight and I couldnapost fill my lungs completely, but I didnapost feel like I was having dficulties serious enough to take up a space someone really seriously ill might need.  Based on the increased information about possible coronavirus symptoms and how I felt - and the timing - I am pretty sure this is coronavirus. However I donapost know, and I canapost find out, which is the really frustrating thing. It made me think, aposDo I now have some form of immunity apos Again I donapost know because I donapost knowthis is the virus. If any opportunity for retrospective testing arises Iaposll be first in theline. Day : Monday A full week has now passed since the onset of Maposs symptoms. His chest pain was as bad as it was on Thursday and he struggled to wake up as late as pm. He felt Paracetamol was losing its effectiveness as the chest pain was now localised. M decided to phone NHS  to arrange a hospital appointment. After an hour on hold, he was asked a series of questions about his condition. Some of any answers clearly raised red flags as the woman decided I needed escalated to the next stage, speaking to a clinician. She couldnapost connect me but spoke to one herself and relayed their questions to me and my answers back. By the end of the first round of questions things were being taken much more seriously and there were a lot of questions about underlying issues etc - I have none. Again, I asked about testing but was told this would not happen unless I had a serious underlying condition or was an NHS worker. M was told a doctor would call him back as it was likely he had coronavirus. The next step was deciding whether he could remain at home or whether he would need to be hospitalised. Half an hour later, he received a phone call from a doctor, who questioned him further before telling him it was likely his symptoms were due to the virus. He reiterated I would not be tested evenI was admitted to hospital, However he was happy for me to stay at home provided I could breathe while at rest -I began panting or became very short of breath without having exerted myself - like going to get a drink - then I should call back urgently. It felt like I finally I had some clarity and knew - as much as I ever would - what was going on. Also I now knew the trigger for things becoming more serious, so I felt a little less panicked. Iaposm terried of doctors and hospitals so it had taken A LOT for me to consider calling and askingI needed treatment, so I was very relieved.

A doctor even suggested it was a good move.The inventive mum posted on Facebook: “Remember those annoying rain covers we got with our prams that we all threw to the back of the cupboard  “I finally found a use for it amongst this covid craziness.” Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email webnews@mirror Some parents online questionedthe hack is safe for the little one.But Dr Sam Hay, a GP from Australia, told Kidspot : Rain covers can provide a valuable barrier for baby from the world around them.“We also know that COVID- can be transmitted by droplets – that means when you cough of sneeze, tiny balls of spit fly out, transmitting the virus to any surface in about a two metre radius. Q: Will my pension be affected  A: It depends what type of pension you’re paying into, how far off retirement you are, oryou have already retired. As a general rule of thumb, the longer you are from retiring, the less reason there is to be concerned. Q: I’ve got a private pension and am a few months off retiring  A: The closer you get to retiring, the more of your pot your pension provider will sht from equitiesinto other assets, such as cash. Doing so will limit the impact of the slump should you opt for an annuity – an insurance policy that pays out in retirement. Q: I’m retired and I opted for a drawdown pension. How am I affected  A: Drawdowns allow you to flexibly take cash out of your pension pot as and when you want. But your funds remain invested and, therefore, at the mercy of stock markets, so can go down as well as up. Q: I’m in a defined benefit pension, including a final salary scheme, will I be affected  A: Unlikely. While the share slump could well hit the fund you’re in, it’s the responsibility of the firm that’s behind it. As long as the firm – or “sponsor” – is doing OK, you’ll be fine. “Now imagine someone coughs or sneezes just as you wheel your pram past – any of those droplets could land on your precious baby. When you are out in the community, you have to be vigilant with washing your hands after everything you touch – because you just don’t know who touched it before you. The UK was put into full lockdown yesterday but Brits are allowed out to buy groceries. And with children off school due to the pandemic, many parents are juggling working from home with childcare duties.But while Dr Hay supported the womanaposs hack, she did stress to ensure babies are safe at all times.

Dad-of-six Paul Williams was beaten to the ground by Connor Jones, who walked away but ed to the stricken man minutes later and, while others were trying to help the casualty, cruelly kicked him in the head.Ten months after the attack, Paul is still suffering with memory and language problems and has lost his senses of taste and smell, reports Wales Online. The man who changed his le has been jailed for six years. Swansea Crown Court heard it was not known what caused the attack though the two men were known to each other having both been carrying out community service work the week before. Robin Rouch, prosecuting, said in the early hours of April  last year Mr Williams was out socialising in Llanelli town centre. Just before .am he became involved in an “altercation” with other men near Bar Luna. Jones then approached the group and attacked the victim, punching him a number of times and knocking him to the floor. The court heard Mr Williams remained on the ground for a minute before getting to his feet at which point Jones punched him down again. Mr Williams managed to get to a nearby wall and sat down but Jones followed him. The prosecutor said a “tussle” then ensued and Jones was seen to carry out “two stamping motions” – though the court heard the defendant denies he stamped on his victim. Jones left the scene but ed a couple of minutes later. By now his victim was lying helpless on the floor being tended by passers-by but the defendant walked up to him and kicked him a number of times to the head. The court heard Mr Williams has no memory of the prolonged attack. The last thing he can remember is leaving the town’s Met bar at around .am and heading towards the Asda supermarket. His next recollection is waking up in bushes near a chapel in the town centre.He managed to stumble home and at around am his we was woken by a “loud bang” at the door. She went downstairs and found her husband being sick and with blood over his face. An ambulance was called and he was rushed to hospital. A subsequent CT scan showed fractures to the cheek, nose, and eye socket bones, and to the skull, as well as multiple contusions to the brain. He had to spend two days in the emergency department. Jones, of Clos Dewi Medi, Morfa, Llanelli, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. The court heard he has a number of previous convictions, though none for offences of violence, and was on a community order at the time of the attack for possession of cannabis and stealing lead from a roof. Dean Pulling, for Jones, said the defendant was remorseful for what he had done and accepted a prison sentence was inevitable.  The barrister said: “This incident is an advert for the pernicious effects of too much alcohol and drugs on young men out late at night.” He added that his client had spent three weeks on remand prior to sentencing which had been his first taste of custody – “an experience he has not found pleasant”. Judge Keith Thomas told Jones he had involved himself in a dispute between other people before punching his victim then “coming for him again” with his feet. Giving the defendant a discount for his guilty plea he sentenced him to six years in prison. Jones will serve half that period in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community. He was also made the subject of a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Williams for the next seven years."},{"url":null,"title":"girl 4 cant consoled after","story":"NewsGirl, , cant be consoled after learning her favourite takeaways have shutA mum has gone viral on social media after sharing her daughters very relatable reaction to discovering that the coronavirus pandemic had caused all her favourite takeaways to shutShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video child-cant-consoled-after-discovering-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news girl--cant-consoled-after-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Four-year-old Layla-Rae from Chelmsford, Essex, was particularly devastated to learn that her favourite takeaway establishments had shut.Her mum, Joanne Charlton, filmed the young girlaposs reaction to finding out that McDonaldaposs, Nandoaposs, KFC and more wouldnapost be available for a little while.And itaposs fair to say the child was completely inconsolable over the whole thing. As Joanne, , told her daughter about the lockdown, the four-year-old can be seen throwing her head back in anguish and howling. Struggling to compose herself, Layla-Rae then asks are Chinese closed too  to which she is left sobbing as her mum confirms that she will have to eat mummyaposs cooking now. The stay-at-home mum decided to film the interaction as she knew her daughter was going to be a drama queen about it - despite admitting that they donapost even eat that many takeaways.She thought the clip was so funny, she later decided to share it on Facebook, where it went viral, garnering over one million views. Joanne said: We were sitting down talking and she has been a bit bored obviously as we have been in isolation. I had been saying all day that we were going to have one last McDonaldaposs and I thought I haven’t really been telling her why I kept saying that. I am very honest with her about what is happening in the world at the moment and I thought I’d explain to her the reasons why as it felt like a good time.She knows Boris Johnson by now and she says to me ‘mummy does Boris Johnson say we can go to the park today’ and I tell her I’m going to have to speak to him to see what he says. She continued: So when I was explaining to her about the takeaways and everything closing I said that Boris is saying they have to close as everybody’s got a lot of germs.I said ‘Layla you do realise that Mcdonaldaposs is closing and is going to be closed for a long time’ and then she started crying a bit and I thought I would pick up my phone to see where this goes. Then she kept on crying as she does like McDonaldaposs - but doesn’t eat it all the time. Afterwards she just cuddled me and then went upstairs to bed and called her nana.

While he is expected to make a full recovery, Jessie issued a warning about the dangers of babies and toddlers being apossecret carriersapos. The -year-old said she first noticed his symptoms on Sunday but didnapost initially think anything was seriously wrong as Perran had been badly teething. The Devon and Cornwall Police admin worker said: It was Motheraposs day and he woke up in a bit of funk with a temperature but we thought he was badly teething. aposaposWe got up early to get some fresh air and thought the cold could help with his temperature but did not think much more of it. We took him for a walk but from lunchtime onwards he started to go downhill quickly. He went really lethargic and really cuddly, which was not like him. He then had a horrendous temperature. He had no breathing dficulties or a cough but was on fire with his temperature.  Jess, from Looe, Cornwall, said the whole family including her husband Joe, , and daughter Felicity, four, are now in  days isolation. She added: We tested his temperature and it was over  degrees. Then we got really worried and we did not know what to do. aposaposThere is a lot of advice out there but it is not clear for children and babies. He is only one. We phoned  and after speaking to five dferent people we got through to a doctor who was really reassuring.  People think babies wonapost get it and it is vital we put the message out they do. aposaposThey will get it but just might not get the severe repercussions. They can still be carriers though and that is what makes it dangerous. Jessie said that while Perran would be okay, the disease had still knocked him for six. She continued: aposaposPeople think children are immune but they are still getting it. He should bounce back but it has still been a bit of a shock for us all. My mum is in the same house and we have to self isolate away from her as she is  and has health concerns.  Perran is still not himself. He is really hot and is jerking awake. He is not really eating, but should be ok. aposaposBut as a mother it has been a horrible thing to go through. He has been really poorly. People are still not understanding the severity of what we are in and you still see some being selfish.

Lauren said she feared for Alfie’s le as he was lying helplessly on a hospital bed and asked her: Mummy, am I going to die  The mother-of-two wrote on Facebook in a post that’s been shared more than , times: Coronavirus is NOT a joke.

I watched him hallucinating and crying from his headache, being taken to hospital by ambulance to be put in isolation pods and be swabbed for the virus and confirmed positive. Lauren described it as the worst experience of her le when Alfie first started to show symptoms on Monday March . Her post continued: His blood sugar levels were only ., his respiratory rate was - and his heart rate was , the sweat was pouring out of him but he was shivering, he was panting for breath and he had photophobia.

So I rang  and they sent an ambulance out in the morning, but they said that the hospital was so busy they couldn’t take him in. They got his temperature down and saidit went back up or he got worse to ring . Describing the scary moment her little boy was rushed off in an ambulance on Thursday afternoon, Lauren continued: Later that evening he was vomiting, hallucinating, crying, holding his head saying it felt like it was going to explode and his eyes were hurting, so the ambulance came out and said we had to go back in. Upon arriving at Worcester hospital, Lauren said they were given masks to wear and were rushed to an isolation room where Alfie was swabbed and tested for Covid-. She described the hospital as a ghost town and said the medical staff were wearing protective gear and masks at all times.  As Lauren also suffered from a cough, she was allowed to stay by Alfie’s side after the paramedics and a nurse gave them a bed in the isolation unit following his positive coronavirus results. She said: They gave him medicine and they kept him stripped off and on fluids to bring his temperature down. I couldn’t fault the hospital staff. They reassured me, kept me informed and askedhe wanted anything. They even brought me tea and coffee!  After being kept overnight from Thursday until Friday evening, Lauren said the hospital allowed them tohome with strict isolation restrictions. She said: ‘‘The hospital advised that as long as I could give Alfie medicine - I would be able to self-isolate us all at home. He’s still recovering now after a week and a day. Today is the first day he has asked for food and has been playing a little bit. He still has a cough and a slight temperature but he is getting better.

It is now almost two months since the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the UK. In the weeks since, most people have become aware that a newly formed dry, persistent cough and a fever are two of the tell-tale signs of Covid-. There are also milder, less obvious symptoms to look out for. Below are some of the signals that may suggest you have been infected. Have you fallen ill with Covid-  Email webnews@trinitymirror Loss of sense of smell and taste Over the weekend the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology warned that losing your sense of smell and taste may mean you have Covid-. The ear, nose and throat specialist recommended anyone with such symptoms self-isolate immediatley. It has been suggested that the phenomena may be caused by the coronavirus killing cells in the nose and throat. Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas, the Association said in a statement. We have also identied a new symptomthat may mean that people without other symptoms but with just the loss of this sense may have to self-isolate - again to reduce the spread of the virus. Ryan Van Waterschoot ended up in hospital relying on an oxygen mask after he fell ill with Covid-. A day after losing his sense of taste and smell he was unable to move. Physical fatigue     Another common symptom of Covid-, as well as cold, flu and many viruses in general, is feeling tired or fatigued. Being told to rest is common when you’re ill, but feeling tired and not being able to sleep due to coughs and dficulty breathing, can make things all the more dficult. Jaimuay Sae-ung, , was the first Thai national to contract coronavirus in December last year. Despite having underlying health conditions, including a heart problem, Jaimuay survived the illness after doctors isolated her at a hospital in Thailand for treatment. I only knewafter I came to the hospital, the mother of seven told Sky News. I felt a bit sad, a bit shocked, tired and fatigued and I couldnapost eat. Those experiencing coronavirus symptoms, such as a cough or fever, should self-isolate for seven days. You should stay at homeyou or or anyone in your household has a high temperature or a new and continuous cough - evenitaposs mild.Everyone in your household must stay at home for  days and keep away from others as it can take  days for them to appear. DO NOT go to your GP or hospital. Go to NHS.UK to check your symptoms and follow the specialist medical advice. Only call you canapost get online, you feel like you canapost cope at home, or your symptoms do not get better after the seven days. If you are pregnant you should call you have any concerns about yourself or unborn baby during self-isolation. Pregnant women are advised to contact their midwe, out-of-hours helplines or a maternity team who will provide information on whether you need to go to hospital.  Mental fatigue Although this has not been officially chalked up as a symptom, Covid- sufferers have reported experiencing mental fatigue. Thea Jourdan told The Daily Mail that she first thought she may have been infected when she got a tickle in her throat and a headache. The mum-of-three then began to experience brain fog. Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever, the Hampshire woman told the publication. But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder. Lack of appetite    To ying degrees those who have caught the coronavirus have complained of losing their appetite. While some may be just a little less intrigued by their food than usual, others, such as racing blogger Stephen Power, have no desire at all to eat. He believes he contracted the disease while at Cheltenham Festival. The North West London man said: Iaposve been in bed with a nasty fever, headache, mild cough  back pain for nearly four days now, Iaposm completely exhausted and have no urge to move or eat. Tummy ache    As with a loss of appetite, enduring a tummy ache may easily be passed off as a sign of something more innocuous. However, a newly published study by the American Journal of Gastroenterology links tummy problems to Covid-. They found that .% of  people who have been infected by the coronavirus in Chinaaposs Hubei province had digestive symptoms such as diarrhoea.

In response to the new rules to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Mrs Foster said: These new rules on social distancing may seem extreme but they are absolutely crucial in slowing the spread of this virus.Do you have a coronavirus story to share  Email  webnews@mirror  Sources told The Sun that the lockdown across the country could even last until May or Junethe virus doesnapost show any signs of slowing.Theclaim that the lockdown could last “anything up to six months, depending on how quickly positive effects are seen.” During his address to the nation, Mr Johnson  didnapost give an exact date for when we would be able toto normal.  The government website states: These measures are effective immediately. The Government will look again at these measures in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows this is possible. This means the current plan is to keep the rules in place for at least three weeks, with the possibility of extending them for even longer.  Italy, the worst hit country in Europe, has been in complete lockdown since March . Tens of thousands of people have been charged for breaking the rules.

While weaposre being urged not to panic buy and store bosses are saying there is enough to go around, people have still been clearing the shelves making it hard to pick up bits like milk, bread, pasta and eggs. This has left many people wonderingthey can freeze some of the things they have in the fridge already - especially as  weaposve been asked to go to the supermarket as little as possible. In short, yes, you can freeze milk - but, itaposs best used when cooking or making smoothies because the texture changes after freezing. It may go slushy, grainy, or have fat separation - but this can be fixed with a blender. You must make sure to freeze it in an air-tight and freezer-safe container because the milk expands. It can be stored for up to six months, but itaposs advised to defrost it within the first months of freezing - but this is just because it tastes better. And, it should be defrosted in the fridge to reduce the chance of bacterial growth. The existing bacteria count in the milk may increasethe milk defrosts at room temperature for a prolonged time.  Healthline says: This is because the longer milk sits at room temperature, the more likely it is that any existing traces of harmful bacteria prolerate, potentially causing the bacterial count to become high enough to cause illness from drinking the milk.You could also place the container in cold wateryou have less time - never hot or warm - but there is a slightly higher risk of bacterial growth. If youaposre planning to cook with frozen milk, defrost it directly in the pot as you are cooking.  Healthline explains that there are a number of dferent types of milk which may separate during freezing.

We’re all in the same situation.“I’ve been nipping to my mum’s and using the gym to keep me occupied but I know I can’t keep doing that.“It’s the best job in the world being a footballer and when you’re not able to do it, it’s rubbish.“However, you have to realise there is a bigger picture. It’s easy to look from a selfish point of view and moan but there is a bigger issue of people’s safety and their health.”He added: “I get cabin fever at the best of times, never mind with this situation.“Anyone who knows me has been saying ‘you’ll go off your head in the house’, I always need to be doing stuff. I’ve been pottering around the house but I struggle to sit around.“I’m already missing going into Dens and seeing everyone, there’s always plenty of banter. I’d usually get a bit off Gowser so it’ll good to get a rest from him!“You think about these things but at the back of the mind you are always aware there are more important things than football, it’s about keeping things in perspective.“That might be good for me in the long-term, I would always have a bad game in my head and people would say ‘there are more important things than football’ and I can definitely see that now.”Training has been cancelled all week at Dens Park and, with no indication from the authorities of when it will be safe to restart playing, Kerr and his team-mates have had to find ways to fill their time away from the football pitch.For a young man like Kerr who is dedicated to his job and keeping himself in the best shape possible for his boyhood club, that’s not been easy and he knows it will get harder over the coming weeks as everyone gets to grips to such a massive change to normal le.The -year-old added: “My usual routine is to head to Dens early doors about am, recently I’ve been doing a bit with the physio Gerry Docherty after the problem with my knee, and start training at am till lunchtime.“Then it’s gym in the afternoon and home before maybe heading to the pool or sauna in the evening. Changing that for me has been dficult.“Since we’ve been off I’ve been getting a longer lie and going to meet up with some people.“Fin Robertson is one of the local boys so we’ve gone for coffee.“It’s the same struggles that everyone is having – going to the shops and not being able to get handwash and stuff like that.“It’s dficult to do anything really because there is nothing concrete to say when we are going to restart.”When the Dark Blues do finally get back out on the pitch, Kerr expects the good form since the start of February to continue as Dundee look to put their up-and-down start to le in the Championship behind them.“I had said from day one we had a really good group of players at the club and I don’t think it was expected we would be so inconsistent,” he added.“The boys who came in in January have all brought something and we had been doing well up until the shutdown.“We have a standard to meet every day and,we were still playing, we would expect to be getting better and better.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – What the coronavirus could mean for Dundee and Dundee United\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-what-the-coronavirus-could-mean-for-dundee-and-dundee-united embed # secreteTtVElWoIb\" data-secret\"eTtVElWoIb\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b029991d13a2-692x564.jpg ","title":"dundee fc dundee united simon murray transfer","story":"Former Dundee and Dundee United striker Simon Murray is targeting ato the Scottish game this summer after playing his last game in South Africa.Murray, , hopes an extension to this season due to the coronavirus shutdown might even see him back in action on home soil before the end of the campaign.The Dundonian has enjoyed the last  months on an adventure at Bidwest Wits in the South African top flight but has had to spend almost the entirety of this season on the sidelines.A damaged cruciate ligament early in the campaign required surgery which saw his place in the squad taken up.Speaking from Johannesburg, he told the Tele: “I hurt my knee in the third game of the season and needed an operation so I’ve been out six-and-a-half months.“Because there’s a limit on the number of foreign players over here, the club signed another forward when I was injured and took my place so we’ve come to an agreement to terminate my contract when I’m fit.“The club have been really good, to be honest, they’ve made sure I got through the injury and looked after me during rehab.“The plan was to stay here in South Africa, get the rehab done and recover from the injury and then head back to Scotland in the summer but because of all this coronavirus it is up in the air.”Murray revealed there has already been interest in his services, once he is back up and running, from Premiership and Championship clubs.He said: “During the injury, I’ve had some interest from a few teams. Nothing concrete, though, and I want to prove my fitness first before doing anything.“If the season gets extended, that might end up being a good thing for me.“There might even be time for me to play for somebody this season depending on what happens. That would be great for my fitness before heading into pre-season.”Despite the impact the coronavirus has had on le back in Scotland, Murray and his family are planning to head back to Dundee in the coming weeks with his time at Wits coming to an end.In South Africa, the virus hasn’t yet had the same effect as in Europe and the football season was only shut down last week.He admits there are worries but being back home and closer to family and friends is a draw for Murray as he plots the next move of a career that has seen him turn out for Montrose, Downfield, Tayport, Dundee Violet, Arbroath, United, Hibs and then the Dark Blues before heading for Johannesburg.CALUM WOODGER: It#s a perfect storm and, make no doubts about it, Dundee and Dundee United are right in the eye of it\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp calum-woodger-dundee-fc-dundee-united-spfl-shutdown embed # secretlKqPsPpAv\" data-secret\"lKqPsPpAv\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"He added: “There haven’t been any deaths so it is all just starting here, to be honest.“I think countries like this have learned from the ones who got it first so President Cyril Ramaphosa here is putting measures in place for prevention, hand sanitiser everywhere and things like that.“I get UK TV so I’ve been hearing all the stuff from home, get to see Boris every night, and it is worrying.“Having lived in South Africa, you are isolated at the best of times anyway so that won’t be as much a problem for people here.“You never walk anywhere for safety reasons – don’t get me wrong, it’s a great place but you have to be careful.”Murray has loved his time in South Africa but says he’s looking forward to getting back home.“I’ve missed Scottish football in some ways, not others I suppose,” he added.“The football is good over here but there’s not the passion in the stands like in Scotland.“It’s a dferent culture.

Bottom of the second tier got £,.Could they not pay out the minimum to everybody right now and decide the rest later Welcome to lockdown everybody! I’ve now been working from home for over a week and getting used to it.

We, therefore, must reduce the number of people ill with Covid- at any one time so the NHS has the resources to treat everyone who needs it.This is known as #flattening the curve#, as shown by the many graphics in the media.Every one of us has a responsibility to reduce our risk of catching the virus.We may become sick ourselves, putting more pressure on the NHS, or pass itSARS-CoV- is a respiratory virus which enters the body, multiplies in the lining of the lungs and can be spread into the air through coughing or sneezing.This can infect someone nearby,they breathe in the virus particles, or get onto people hands from contaminated surfaces and enter their respiratory tract, predominantly through the nose and mouththey touch their face.Good hygiene is therefore critical and the actions people need to take areThe key is to reduce the risk of inhaling viral droplets they have coughed intoAs this demands really signicant changes to our way of le, it is the hardest action to take. While many have been following the advice to work from home where possible, and avoid crowding together in pubs and clubs, others have remained complacent thinking this is all overblown as they don’t know anyone who is affected.The reason for that is that the virus spreads #exponentially# which means theThe result is that cases double every few days but, for a long time, the numbers are still very low and people remain complacent then, suddenly, it appears to be everywhere!The problem is that once the numbers get big enough for people to notice, it isThis is why, no matter how drastic the measures feel, it is only by closing theFor younger people, who think they will just have a bit of a #flu#, there have been serious cases documented in younger adults but, crucially, they could pass the virus to older parents or grandparents and make them very seriously ill.The last pandemic on this scale was the   Influenza outbreak and theSt Louis, which cancelled all gatherings, had just over a tenth of the deaths seen inObviously closing down leisure businesses has a huge impact on the economy and onWhile more needs to be done for the self-employed, the financial support offered byIn the four months since the first reports from Wuhan, Covid- has spreadBut that same interconnection has led to research being shared openly on the internetWhile it took years to identy the virus causing HIV, SARS-CoV- was identied in just over a month: followed swtly by a test.Currently, research teams all over the world are working together to develop improved tests, identy anti-viral drugs that can treat Covid- and create a vaccine to provide immunity in the future.Covid- is the biggest public health challenge we have faced in any of our letimes and, until such time as there is a treatment or a vaccine, the only way of getting through this crisis iseveryone plays their part in #breaking the chain# of spread and slowing the disease."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50167704-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50167704-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50167704-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.50167704-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"reading papers is safe health chiefs say covid 19 unlikely to be picked up from newspapers","story":"Readers and online shoppers have been assured by health chiefs that it is safe to pick up a newspaper or package.Concerns have been raised after questions surfaced whether flicking through a paper could transmit the Covid- disease to readers.However, the World Health Organisationhas deemed it safe to receive packages such as newspapers, even from areas which have reported cases of coronavirus.A statement from WHO said: “The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes Covid- from a package that has been moved, travelled, and exposed to dferent conditions and temperature is also low.”"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor january 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,in  The Argyllshire Advertiser ran a story entitled #Skate park pipe dream a reality for Lochgilphead#. Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column january 31 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsEver since it was #temporarily# closed to new admissions around two years ago, there has been the suspicion that plans were afoot to close Knapdale Ward completely.The HSCP claims to have consulted widely on the future of the ward, yet patients# relatives, front-line nurses and medical professionals say they were never asked for their views.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column february 7 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsDog walkers on the banks of the Crinan Canal need to take collective responsibility for lting their canine companions# mess.There is no excuse for leaving it lying for others to tread in, push a pram through or meet while cutting grass.The bins are there, so use them.We wish Rhona Love all the best in her shooting career.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Editor Andrew McQuarrie grabbed a torch, pulled on his big-boy trousers and joined the funhellipIt was .pm on a Saturday night and I was trying to communicate with a supernatural beingusing a pair of copper rods.Having done as instructed and asked the tools a simple lsquoYes Norsquo question, I was slightly dismayed to see the rods stubbornly remaining still, the spirit apparently refusing to play ball.Sheila, an employee of UK Ghost Nights, appeared quite perplexed as her eyes darted between me and the rods.ldquoAre you a sceptic  she asked, a faint edge of suspicion laced in her voice.I admitted that I was indeed a sceptic, but one who was more than willing to be converted into a true believer.Happy with this answer, Sheila ushered me into a corner that was, she said, known to be particularly popular with spirits.ldquoAre we in Melrose  I asked the rods, willing them to show even the smallest hint of movement.But after a full minute of tense observation, it was plain to see the equipment would not co-operate.An hour earlier, when the ghost experts were delivering their briefing, they had promised the  paying customers that ldquonothing is fabricated on the tours.The insinuation, it seemed to me, was that this would likely not be a night of high drama and theatrics.Nevertheless, I couldnrsquot help but feel a bit disappointed that my opening bid to converse with the dead had fallen distinctly flat.And over the next four hours, so it would prove, my luck would not change much.Yet, as I wandered the portrait-lined corridors of the George  Abbotsford Hotel, trying to channel my inner Bill Murray, some of the people to whom I spoke offered compelling tales.Few were as gripping as those delivered by Dawn Barrett - owner of the hotel for the last  months - and her cooking team.Among the unusual goings-on noted by Mrs Barrett, for instance, were lights turning on and off on their own, furniture moving around, footsteps at all hours and even the feeling of her hair being brushed.Asked for her views on the supernatural, Mrs Barrett said: ldquoI definitely believe - Irsquove seen and heard too much now.It was Mrs Barrett herself who contacted UK Ghost Nights in the first place, with the aim of getting to the root of what makes the hotel tick.ldquoI want to know why they [spirits] are here. I donrsquot understand how they can put lights on and off. I just want to understand it more, she said.Head chef Kailee Reidie, , spoke of an alarming encounter with a spirit who has come to be known as John, supposedly a grouchy ex-chef.As Kailee turned on the fryer one evening, while she was alone in the kitchen, her hair was pulled back so sharply that she was thrown into the table behind her, banging her head.ldquoAs soon as I turned my back on him [John], thatrsquos when it happened, recalled Kailee, going on to explain her emotions at the time.ldquoI was in shock because I knew he [John] was there, but Irsquom not a big believer in ghostshellip Irsquove never seen John - itrsquos just a feeling.Just a feeling. Well, there was certainly a sense of foreboding in some areas of the building - not least the cellar and the attic.In one of the attic rooms, we indulged in an activity called the lsquohuman pendulumrsquo. This entails three people standing in a row, with the person in the middle acting as the spiritrsquos means of communication.When the spirit is asked a Yes No question, the piggy in the middle is expected to rock forwards for a lsquoYesrsquo and backwards for a lsquoNorsquo - a movement being directed by the answering spirit.One by one, the customers lined up to participate in this creepy experiment, watched by the rest of the room with a mixture of excitement and dread.Time and again, the spiritrsquos presence was well felt. In fact, there turned out to be a number of obliging spirits, each surprisingly keen to answer questions including, lsquoDo you have childrenrsquo  and lsquoAre you happy with us being herersquo As I watched this circus unfold, I was praying Irsquod be able to endure the entire episode as an observer, a witness to the craziness.Not so much because I was scared - although I was a little, I must admit - but more because I knew what would happen.,params: .pushldquoAndrew, would you like to have a shot in the middle What followed was several minutes of embarrassment for everyone.Because of course I didnrsquot move. Not even an inch.

But still not enough to push me into the camp of believers.The more I dwelt on the nightrsquos events, however, the more I came to realise the deeper signicance of it all.Before the tour, UK Ghost Nights founder Lisa Tedstill had made sure I was aware of the crucial equipment to bring.ldquoAll you need is a torch and a sense of humour, she said, going on to lay her finger on the true essence of the affair.ldquoWe donrsquot guarantee there will be any paranormal activity - anyone who does that is a charlatan.ldquoBut we can guarantee everybody will have a very fun experience.And, indeed, while I may have left the George  Abbotsford that night without a firmer belief in ghosts, I certainly ed home with a smile."},{"url":null,"title":"council-powers-handed-chief-meetings-scrapped","story":"PLANS to hand Scottish Borders Councilchief Tracey Logan delegated control of decision-making are expected to be rubber-stamped this week.It comes hot on the heels of Prime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos instruction that everyone in the UK should spend most of their time at home in order to counter the coronavirus outbreak.But on Thursday , in an unprecedented move, proposals to temporarily delegate the local authorityrsquos decision-making responsibility to the Chief Executive will be passed.Council meetings in Newtown St Boswells will be cancelled until September , with the exception of vital committee meetings which will be done through video-conferencing.SBC chief legal officer Nuala McKinlay stated: ldquoAs the virus makes a wider impact on public le, Scottish Borders Council must consider how to respond.\"In taking any decision to protect health by limiting social contact, it must also ensure processes are in place to enable it to continue to make urgent decisions.ldquoIn order to allow decisions to be made, it is proposed that all those decision-making s of council which can lawfully be delegated, be delegated to the chief executive to be made in consultation with members and relevant senior officers.It is also proposed that any committee meetings which do need to take place between now and October will be held via remote video links.Ms McKinlay added: ldquoThe Local Government in Scotland Act  allows a local authority to y that process and conduct a meeting by other ways.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

He also addressed meetings at Drumlemble and Carradale.Captain Elliot, MP for Lanark, who has made an early and effective impression in the House of Commons since he entered it in the beginning of the present Parliament, and who was recently referred to by a Parliamentary correspondent as one of the most promising of the younger members of the House, opened a tour of the southern part of the constituency at Tarbert, and on Saturday made his way down the western seaboard of Kintyre, speaking at Whitehouse, Clachan, Tayinloan, Muasdale, Glenbarr, and Ballochantee.As the member for an agricultural constituency, Captain Elliot was able to deal with the questions which are of supreme importance to rural people with keen personal knowledge and insight, and his addresses were heard with marked appreciation.Captain Elliot spoke at the Cattle Market, Campbeltown, on Monday, and again in the Victoria Hall on the same night, when he partnered Mr A. MacCallum Scott, MP for Bridgeton, Glasgow. At this large meeting, at which Colonel Rome presided, the speakers dealt clearly, vigorously and effectively with the questions at present in the forefront of politics, Mr MacCallum Scott being particularly successful in his method of dealing with interrupters.Meetings were also held at Southend, Drumlemble and Carradale, the above speakers being joined for their work in the outlying parts by Miss Pressley Smith, MBE.The final rally in the Victoria Hall on Tuesday nightbrought together a great meeting and the full audience gave the speakers a rousing reception."},{"url":null,"title":"community rallies to support vulnerable as virus spreads","story":"Many businesses, charities and iniduals have come forward, offering their services to the people told to self-isolate as they are likely to suffer the worstthey contract the virus # people aged over , people with specic underlying health conditions, or people who are pregnant.Here are some of the businesses who are going to extra mile to help out.

Shersquos right, of course. We need such stories just now.My response was: ldquoYes, we all need to make our own version of Stone Soup.My youngest daughter overheard me. ldquoYuck, I donrsquot want that, I want porridge for breakfast like usual, she said.I reassured her and reminded her of the story. Itrsquos an old tale Irsquove shared in these pages before. It has many versions and I base the story in a land when there is a famine and people have very little food on which to survive, and so understandably people keep what little they have for their own use.But then a wise traveller fills his pot with water and begins to boil it over a fire. Then he adds a stone. People get curious and ask: ldquoWhat are you making  The traveller replies: ldquoStone soup.ldquoStone soup  Never heard of that.ldquoOh, itrsquos delicious and very filling.ldquoCould I try some ldquoOf course, but it would taste betteryou had something to add to it, says the traveller.And so as the story unfolds, each person adds a little to the pot, which means in the end the soup really is delicious and filling, and there is enough for all, because everyone has shared the little they have.But before they eat, the traveller does one last thing ndash takes out the stone!My daughter remembered the story and was reassured stone soup wasnrsquot on the breakfast menu. But I think the storyrsquos meaning has deeper signicance than just the sharing of food. Itrsquos also about the sharing of ourselves, and how adding a little bit of who we are can transform the pot of community.In the midst of all the fear and panic around us just now, this is what is happening. People are helping out, checking on neighbours and thinking how their own behaviour can affect others who are more vulnerable.And in all this, our mental wellbeing is as important as our physical health. Irsquom reminded of something my motherrsquos partner once told me. His name was Harry. He was originally from Holland and in his childhood he lived through the horric Dutch famine of -.He said: ldquoWe survived on rotten potato soup, tulip bulbs and a joke a day. Sometimes the jokes were as rotten as the potatoes but just as important!We need to smile, laugh and feel connected, especially in dficult times. We can all begin our own metaphorical stone soup and invite others to contribute and share.For example, many of my fellow storytellers are arranging online storytelling sessions. I will be telling stories online for the schools I currently work with and Irsquom happy to do likewise for any other organisation or group ndash once my six-year-old has taught me how the technology works!There are local musicians playing online gigs, people sharing recipes, visiting older family members outside their windows, writing letters and telephoning people for a chat the list goes on. One idea can lead to another, and soon a new community pot is made!Every contribution, no matter how seemingly small, can make a big dference to that pot. And in so doing, it will challenge that sense of despair and powerlessness that so many of us feel right now.So the question should be: Whatrsquos your thing  How can you safely share it  Whatrsquos your amusing or uplting story or your talent  Think about it and letrsquos share, for others, as well as ourselves.And so in the spirit of this, here is my wee contribution for this week itrsquos a funny wee tale passed onto me, so I claim no credit or originality for it. It was told to me by an Irish friend, but Irsquove adapted it slightly.There was this van driver called George who got a job delivering monkeys to the zoo. Unfortunately, his van broke down and while waiting for the mechanic the monkeys began to get restless.Then another van driver called Archie pulled up and askedhe could help.ldquoIrsquom late for my delivery. If I give you pound, will you take these monkeys to the zoo  asked George.ldquoSure, said Archie.So Archie took the monkeys away in his van.George waited for the mechanic and finally his van was repaired. He then set off for the zoo to make sure the monkeys were delivered successfully.But to his surprise, he saw Archie walking along the street with the monkeys!George called out to him: ldquoWhat are you doing  I gave you pound to take the monkeys to the zoo!Archie called back: ldquoI did, but we got a group discount, I have some money left, so now Irsquom taking them to the cinema!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-residents-urged-keep-helping-east-lothian-foodbank","story":"The foodbank, based in Tranent, provides food parcels to vulnerable members of the community.Candace Higgins, foodbank director, said the situation was changing ldquohour by hour, adding: ldquoWe are still operating as normal but certain protocols have been put in place when delivering food parcels.Volunteers making deliveries are now simply knocking on doors or ringing bells, rather than waiting for doors to be opened to them.

This includes people over , as well as people with underlying conditions that could make the symptoms of coronavirus worse.Unfortunately for these people, self-isolation means not leaving your house - making going walks outside or meeting friends an impossibility.

The government website actually encourages people to get plenty of exercise and fresh air.ldquoAt times like these, the website reads, ldquoit can be easy to fall into unhealthy patterns of behaviour which in turn can make you feel worse.\"Its only warning is not to get too close to other people when outside, asking walkers to stay at least two metres away from each other.Coronavirus: the facts by the World Health Organisation and the NHSWhat is coronavirus COVID- is a respiratory illness that can affect lungs and airways. It is caused by a virus called coronavirus.What caused coronavirus The outbreak started in Wuhan in China in December  and it is thought that the virus, like others of its kind, has come from animals.How is it spread As this is such a new illness, experts still arenrsquot sure how it is spread. But similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Therefore covering your nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing, and disposing of used tissues straight away is advised. Viruses like coronavirus cannot live outside the body for very long.What are the symptoms The NHS states that the symptoms are: a dry cough, high temperature and shortness of breath - but these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness. Look out for flu-like symptoms, such as aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose and a sore throat. Itrsquos important to remember that some people may become infected but wonrsquot develop any symptoms or feel unwell.What precautions can be taken Washing your hands with soap and water thoroughly. The NHS also advises to cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleevewhen you cough or sneeze put used tissues in the bin immediately and try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell. Also avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean.Government adviceAs of Monday, March , the government advised that everyone should be observing social distancing - avoiding unnecessary travel and working from home where possible. Anyone with a cough or cold symptoms now needs to self-isolate with their entire household for  days.The over s or anyone who is vulnerable or living with an underlying illness are being asked to be extra careful and stay at home to self-isolate.For more information on government advice, please check their website.Should I avoid public places The advice now is to avoid public places and any non-essential travel. Travel abroad is also being advised against for the next  days at least, and many European countries have closed their borders.What should I doI feel unwell Donrsquot go to your GP but instead call NHS  or look online at the coronavirus service that can tell youyou need medical help and what to do next.When to call NHS NHS  should be usedyou feel unwell with coronavirus symptoms, have been in a country with a high risk of coronavirus in the last  days oryou have been in close contact with someone with the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"tesco-take-20-000-new-staff","story":"Tesco has become the latest supermarket to announce plans to recruit new staff to cope with the coronavirus outbreak overwhelming stores.The UKrsquos biggest grocer said it will recruit , temporary workers for at least the next  weeks.Its recruitment drive was launched on Wednesday, adding ldquosince then we have already been overwhelmed by support from the public and thank everyone who has applied to work with us in stores.Some staff are being interviewed, processed and working within the same day, Tesco added.Tescorsquos HR chief, Natasha Adams, said: ldquoIrsquom so proud to be welcoming thousands of new colleagues to Tesco.

insisting that people were complying with the Governmentrsquos social distancing advice by keeping two metres away from others while visiting the scenic coast and getting exercise.One said on

also adhering to social distancing rules, exactly as the Government and chief medical officer advises.It was also suggestedthat it was much easier to keep two metres away from others on a beach than in a shop.It is understood that the council faces a practicle issue about physically closing the car parks, which do not have barriers.East Lothian Council scrapped plans to introduce barriers when it

Next think you screw it up on the back nine because youre score orientated. So I think your focus, your attention, has got to be on as much as you can, just on the task at hand, which is the next shot.\"Alex said his research ldquohelps us understand what concentration looks like in sport and what golfers need to do to concentrate.They all use mental tricks to concentrate and stop bad shots having a negative impact on their score.

At some point that information, that facts and that evidence will see the light of day.Sources have already told The Herald that Mr Salmond is set to instruct his trial lawyers, Levy  McRae, to take legal action against the Scottish Government over its handling of the complaints against him.Now the trial has finished, some of what he wanted led in court can be reported for the first time.At a preliminary hearing in January, the defence Mr Salmond hoped to use was laid out by his QC, Gordon Jackson, before trial judge Lady Dorrian.As Mr Salmond sat in the dock, Mr Jackson went through the lines of questioning he wanted to take with female complainers in the case, a standard legal step given the sensitivity involved in questioning them.Mr Jackson said it was a ldquovery unusual case from a ldquopolitical bubble.At its heart was the Scottish Governmentrsquos botched in-house investigation into two complaints of sexual misconduct against Mr Salmond when he was First Minister.After news of the investigation leaked in August , Mr Salmond launched a judicial review into how the Scottish Government ran this investigation.On  January , Mr Salmond won the review after ministers admitted it had been flawed from the outset.Because the investigating official had been in prior contact with the two complainers, the whole process was deemed to have been unfair, unlawful and ldquotainted by apparent bias.Mr Salmond claimed at the time there had been a conspiracy. ldquoSome people are very clearly very anxious to remove me now as a political threat, which is why this is probably not over, he said.Mr Salmondrsquos legal team intended to claim this humiliation for Ms Sturgeonrsquos government spurred a coordinated campaign to discredit him.:Nicola Sturgeon faces profound questions of integrity after Alex Salmond acquittalAt the preliminary hearing, Mr Jackson estimated the ldquoshambles had cost taxpayers up to pound million in legal fees.He said people working in the Government, deeply unhappy at the judicial review outcome, therefore ldquoturned their attention very directly to the criminal process.These people ldquowith a clear motivation sought to influence that process in order to discredit the former First Minister, Mr Jackson said.He said there was a ldquoconcerted effort made by people within the Government to advance the criminal process ldquoas best they could.He said people who did not want to be part of a criminal inquiry, or did not think any crime had been committed against them, or want to complain, were ldquoencouraged to complain.He said the ldquoprime mover was one of the complainers in the indictment.At a further hearing in Glasgow in February, Mr Jackson also quoted a text message from one complainer to an SNP employee: ldquoJeez, think [a complainer] is in trouble. [Salmond] isnrsquot going to stop until he gets her and hersquos bringing down Nicola on the way.After considering Mr Jacksonrsquos proposed questioning, Lady Dorrian disallowed much of it and the judicial review barely featured in the trial.His legal team constrained, Mr Salmond pushed the conspiracy theory when giving his own evidence, saying some allegations were ldquodeliberate fabrications for a political purpose, while others were ldquoexaggerations.Besides Mr Salmondrsquos desire for revenge, Ms Sturgeon also faces two crucial inquiries into her conduct related to the judicial review.After the Governmentrsquos case collapsed in , Ms Sturgeon insisted that she had, rightly, not known about the in-house probe taking place.She said Mr Salmond had informed her about it himself when he visited her Glasgow home in April .She told MSPs the meeting had been a purely ldquoparty matter, not a government one, and so there was no need to have officials present or to report it to her private office ndash a potential breach of the ministerial code which will now be investigated.However, at the trial, Mr Salmondrsquos former chief of staff, who brokered the meeting, said he met Ms Sturgeon in her Holyrood office a few days earlier, something she has never revealed.A Holyrood committee inquiry set up after the review will want to knowMs Sturgeon misled Parliament.Ms Sturgeonrsquos husband, SNP chief executive Peter Murrell, is also facing calls from Mr Salmondrsquos outriders for an inquiry into how the party handled complaints against the former leader. Ms Sturgeon last night said coronavirus had to come first."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-meet-man-gave-rat-race-live-forest","story":"Briton Will Dean, , and his we Emilia, , bought the .-acre clearing in the middle of a Swedish forest  years ago and moved there full time in .It had no access road and their selfbuilt home, located  minutes north of Gothenburg, can only be reached along a winding tree-lined dirt road, weather ndash and moose ndash permitting.A twice-monthly trip to the one shop in their nearest town ndash which is  minutes drive away ndash sees them have to take a chainsaw in case they come across a fallen tree.So for Mr Dean itrsquos much easier to be as self sufficient as he can be ndash with water from his self-dug, -metre well, potatoes from the vegetable patch and wood from trees around his home.The successful crime writer ndash the author of a series of books featuring deaf reporter Tuva Moodyson ndash and his lawyer we work from home in separate wooden huts.They meet in the middle for lunch when work permits.

I think most people wouldnrsquot want to live here, including most Swedish people, who wouldnrsquot be able to go to a coffee shop.ldquoBut wersquore used to it, and really like it.

Your country needs you to be as lazy as humanly possible.Just... stay in your house. Covid- can only be quashedwe self-isolate and socially distance ourselves.And yet, and yet. People still seem incapable of taking the advice fully on board.At the weekend we saw city dwellers flocking to the countryside to take advantage of the lovely weather, and to hang with any germs they might be carrying with them to the remoter parts of the country.There were umpteen social media posts from those who just couldnt bear the pubs being shut on a Friday night and so went to hotels to drink at their bars, and never mind about the bar staff who had to serve them or the housekeeping staff who had to clean up after them.Snowdoniarsquos National Park Authority announced yesterday it has closed its main carparks ldquofollowing the busiest visitor weekend in living memory.The sunshine was part of the problem. Here weve been stuck indoors over a long and storm laden winter. Now, finally, the weather has turned and we had two beautul, crisp, sunny days to play with.Yet we werent meant to play with them. We were meant to stand at the window and gaze out at them, forlornly.The government advice is that a walk outside is good for you so, like others and understandably, I tried on Sunday to go for a walk. The park was hoaching with people and keeping a solid two metre distance was not possible so I ed home.Thats part of the problem with social distancing - it only workseveryone gets on board. If some of us are weaving about and leaping out of the way like Jumping Frenchmen of Maine while others wander blindly in our path, its not effective.The messages from the English and Scottish governments is also conflicting. Late on Saturday night - far too late - Boris Johnson advised that people should not visit their mums for Mothers Day. Stay put, he advised.Scotlands National Clinical Director Jason Leitch, who is excellent, calm, measured and clear, gave his three-step advice for Mothers Day. Dont visit, he said, or try to have a video all with mum. Butyou do visit then wash your hands, have mum wash her hands, and stay two metres away from each other.The upshot was everyone translating the advice dferently - some insisting you cant visit your mother at all, others saying it would be fine.On Friday night Mr Leitch appeared on BBC Scotlands The Nine and said visiting the hairdressers was fine, as salons tend to be one of the more sanitary places you can visit. On Monday Nicola Sturgeon said hair salons should close.The messaging is not straightforward. \"Social distancing\" is relatively meaningless. I saw a great tweet asking why the messaging isnt \"the two metre rule\" - much easier to grasp.What really is easy to grasp, though, is that we should stay at home unless for vital journeys or a bit of solo exercise. All  is paused for now.If you have symptoms and live with other people then  days at home and dont cross the doorstep. Ive come across people who have symptoms and are going out and about as usual. That is unconscionable. Why are they doing it  Because they dont think the rules apply to them and, while they have symptoms, they dont believe them to really be Covid-.Its really moot, for the purposes of the behaviour of the general public, whether its Covid- or not. This is not the time for self-diagnosis or taking chances because you believe yourself to be the exception to the rule.Jeane Freeman MSP put it beautully: \"You are neither an exception nor exceptional.\"This is not the time for bending the rules to suit your bespoke and special circumstances. This is the time for knuckling down and doing exactly whats asked. If you have symptoms and you go outside then your actions could be responsible for a death. Being stuck indoors when the sun is shining is rubbish. Is it worth making other people gravely ill The advice to just stay in your house is more dficult when you live with people you dont particularly like or you have flatmates who are a pain in the behind. Its frightening advice when you live with someone who is abusive.But for the majority of us it just means a prolonged spell of slight tedium, perhaps with some whining weans wed like a break from. In the absolute grand scheme of things, this is not a terrible situation to be in.Stay home and fewer people will die.

We are implementing a new rule that means there will only be one person in a Royal Mail delivery vehicle at any one time.#Processes have been further reviewed to minimise the passing of work between colleagues. And we are calling for the washing of hands when colleagues enter and leave Royal Mail buildings, as well as at regular times during the day.#In order to protect further both staff and customers, Royal Mail has said it will not be handing over hand-held devices to customers to capture signatures during signed deliveries. Postal workers will instead log the name of the person accepting the item, and can sign on their behalf.The managing director added: #For all customerswhere we need to deliver any parcel that won’t fit through their letterbox, we will place their item at their door.#Having knocked on the door, we will then step aside to a safe distance while they retrieve their item. This will ensure the item is delivered securely rather than being left outside.“If they are unable to come to the door at all we will issue a #something for you# card, advising of other ways they can arrange to get their item.#For example, by getting a friend or family member to collect the parcel from our local customer service point on their behalf. In this situation, and to keep their mail as secure as possible, they will need to bring along the card we left and a form of ID in the name of the person the item is addressed to.#In line with guidance from the UK#s chief medical officer and public health authorities, Royal Mail is also advising colleagues that good hand hygiene is the first and most important line of defence.“We continue to act on public health authority advice which is updated daily,#  explained Mr O’Riordain.#In the meantime we share regular updates and information with colleagues. We have also adopted enhanced disinfectant cleaning of communal areas in all Royal Mail sites on a daily basis. We are monitoring the situation closely.“Public health authorities have advised people receiving parcels are not at risk of contracting coronavirus.

What is alarming is how little challenge there has been to our government#s decision to take a dferent path from that recommended by the World Health Organisation . Shetland, Scotland and the UK is out of synch with almost everywhere  in how we are trying to tackle this coronavirus. We are not #following the science#, as ‘experts’ and politicians of ious colours frequently suggest. The scientic community is itself ided over this issue and we are following a particular reading of the science.WHO’s consistent advice has been to test, track and trace every suspected case of coronavirus. The overwhelming majority of countries are taking this approach. The UK Scientic Advisory Group For Emergencies , the body advising our politicians, do not believe we can contain the virus using the WHO#s methodology, so our government has allowed the virus to spread, while attempting to control itin a manner that doesn#t put excessive pressure on the NHS at any particular point during the outbreak.My opinion is worth little on this matter # but the fact the UK is taking a dferent approach concerns me, given the WHO#s history in dealing with virus outbreaks such as this. What disturbs me is the apparent lack of awareness about UK exceptionalism on this issue. We must come together to overcome this problem but people will only buy into a collective effortthey have at least a basic understanding of what we are trying to do and why. #We know best # trust us# will not do. Scrutiny, questions and critique are vital when there is still much to learn and so much is at stake. You are not an idiot. Please don#t let name calling, or whatever, put you off getting better informed about this most crucial of matters.At last count  out of the  countries that presently exist have recorded cases#.How do you know who is taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done or how those governments rhetoric dfers from the actual reality  We have much ignorance and  information in the media, and as always the headless-chicken doom-merchants tell fake tails of doom. Only yesterday a self-ordained fitness person Facebooked about a boy trapped with the corpse of his sister for three days. The actual truth no otherwise healthy child has died worldwide of Covid, not one ever. The boy was a man, the sister was  and died of status epilepticus! Just what possesses people to peddle such tripe is beyond comprehension, but the online media is awash with it.I don#t think anybody knows which governments are taking exactly what advice, how many tests are being done by every one of them or how their rhetoric dfers from the actual reality. I certainly don#t know and never claimed I did. I said the majority of countries are adopting the WHO approach, successfully or otherwise.I appreciateisn#t gospel and apologiseyou, or anybody , has evidence contrary to what they have stated.Time will tell whether this alternative approach has been for better or worse.Ian T # South Korea has followed WHO guidelines, testing more people per capita than anywhere , and the number of new cases there has dropped drastically.The country recorded  new cases of Covid- yesterday, compared with a peak of  cases on February th.I understand there is every chance the virus will spread again in South Koreaonce social contact restrictions are lted, but at the very least their efforts to contain the spread has bought them more time.More time to make sure their NHS and other essential services are prepared as well as possible. More time to acquire testing capability. More time to shield those most at risk from the virus as best as possible.You claim the WHO approach has been unsuccessful. South Korea adopted it and has had more success fighting this virus than anywhere .I appreciate what works in one country may not work where. What concerns me is our governmentshave paid little heed to the likes of South Korea and taken a path at odds with almost everywhere .A failure to adequately explain why has induced panic as much as anything . Now the UK resources are going into the new antibody test. That tells us who is immune, a far far more useful thing to know.You said earlier in this thread: #We have much ignorance and  information in the media.# I suggest you focus on getting your facts right before you start bashingor the press at large. Unless of course you have abandoned the truth and decided to take the path of the most habitual of liars Donald Trump  In which case I#d have more success debating this issuewith a brick!For heaven#s sake Helen, we have gone beyond our capacity to trace, let alone test. Whatever did you write your PhD thesis in, headlesschikenology or alarmistscarmongology !Faroes which have fixed links between the islands have  times as many cases as Shetland. May just be coincidence but i would have thought that fixed links help spread disease more quickly.Yes Ian, a car in a tunnel does go a little bit faster than a ferry. So the spread by fixed link will perhaps be accelerated by a few minutes. Now, what probably makes more sense is that Faroe has a population of , rather more than  times that of Shetland., proportionally per head of population,Faroe, fixed links and all is doing rather better than us!!!Ian T.I think you may have accidently hit an extra  there # The current population of the Faroe Islands is c. , Ian, Faroe had a population of , as of June  . Unlike Shetland they are almost certainly testing for Covid- more widely in the community, so it is not possible to directly compare our current figure of  hospital tested cases to their .Whoops, no. I gave the population of Faro!! Portugal!!! Dyslexia rules OK!!!!Just to state the obvious. If you are afraid for yourself,relatives and loved ones. All you have to do is stay inside your house. It is as simple as that.This Virus can not get to youyou do that simple thing. It is not rocket science!!!Yes it can, via an envelope retrieved from a mailbox, groceries and any other items brought into your home that have been handled by other people.There are some strategies you may employ to minimize risk of contamination.Wear disposable gloves when retrieving mail, disinfect the mail before bringing it into your house.Junk mail should go directly from the mailbox to the bin. Retrieve mail only every two to three days to minimize exposure.As to groceries, avoid fresh produce.Wear disposable gloves when shopping.Only buy canned or frozen items and sanitize them before putting into storage.Ideally, buy enough that you can rotate the stock.Use only grocery items, canned or frozen that have been in your possession for  days or more.On the other handyou literally stay in your house and not opened the door to anyone or thing, for the next month or two, or three, or four# the virus probably will not be able to get to you.

We watched as petrol bombs were made on a makefht production line and stored behind the barricade at the top of Ramoan Gardens. Young as we were, we knew that this was an epoch-making time.My most vivid memory from those franticfew days in August is of Patcheye Doyle standing on the roof of a Morris  which was caving in under his weight. His one eye dancing, he was roaring at a gathering of local men, urging them to get organised before the next onslaught. A fearsome and fearless scrapper of some reknown, Patcheye took the lead while others dithered. He was a hard man, in a time when that epithet was more than a throwaway schoolyard taunt.And of course, there was real fear abroad. There were no weapons to hold off an invasion, no police force to turn to for protection.And yet, the people did pull together defences, after a fashion. Barricades went up, British Army ‘ex-servies’ patrolled the streets and the people turned to each other for support and comfort.Mistakes were made too in the maelstrom. Some concerned matters of le and death, others were less consequential but remain with me: I remember the proud pine trees on the Glen Road being cut down to block the road. You can still seethe gaps where they once stood – and where their more fortunate cousins continue to watch over us.And, yet,we survived. Not in one piece, admittedly. But we emerged on the other side. Changed for sure, stronger undoubtedly but also scarred.And so what I can retrieve from thoseall-but forgotten memories of the heady days of August ’ to help us as we march headlong into this coming Cornavirus hurricane  Well, put up the barricades. Protect your neighbour. Gear up for the fight.But most of all, listen to the key men and women – those selfless heroes who we will find today not on car roofs but in the hospital emergency rooms and the Intensive Care Units. They have given us fair warning: keep your distance, isolate and defend the elderly, wash your hands and, above all , stay at home.I can put it no better than in the words of a -year-old paper boy who arrived, complete with surgical gloves, to the Andersonstown News offices last week insisting that he be allowed to do his door-to-doorpaper round — which we had cancelled in light of the crisis. Pointinga gloved finger at me, he said, “I will knock the f*** out of this Coronavirus.” Patcheye must be smiling down.Today it’s not Shankill against Falls or unionist versus nationalist. It’s all of us, one people, one city, and one battle which we cannot and which we most certainlyWILL NOTlose."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus decision on northern ireland schools staying open for easter yet to be taken","story":"Concerned: Justin McCamphill FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappConcerned: Justin McCamphillBy Claire WilliamsonMarch   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhether or not schools remain open for key workers# children during the Easter holidays remains under consideration, the Department of Education has said.Almost  schools stayed open on Monday and nearly  will be open by the end of the week, according to Education Minister Peter Weir.The NASUWT, Northern Ireland#s biggest teachers# union, said it was unaware of plans directing schools to remain open over the holidays.It added it would not agree with teachers having to work.Northern Ireland national officer Justin McCamphill said: During the period of continued closures, some schools may seek to provide childcare to priority households outside of term time .

This forced Mr Currie to keep the school’s doors closed yesterday and Monday so he could re-do the application process and reduce the numbers. Parents were informed of the development last weekend, he added,Mr Currie said it was frustrating that he had to take such action because of the high number of parents working in key roles.“I had to reinstate the policy of only accepting children whose parents are both key workers,” he said.​“In Killinchy there are a large number of parents in key worker jobs, so there’s a lot of people there that need childcare. It was a perfect storm for me.”He stressed that in addition to the high number of requests, he was also dealing with reducing staffing levels following government advice that those who are at a high risk of contracting Covid- should stay at home.“The result of that was my available staff base was decimated,” he said. “I had the double-edged sword of an increased flux of parents with the one key worker criteria and the complete decimation of my staff. I then issued a plea to parents saying, ‘Pleaseyou really, really don’t need us, don’t use us. On that plea I got eight withdrawals, but it was still far, far too high. “I couldn’t implement social distancing in the school. I couldn’t keep staff safe.“On that basis I had no choice but to re-run the whole application process. I then issued exceptional closure notices for Monday and Tuesday to look at the two key worker criteria again.“Those coming to schoolare the children of blue-light workers and frontline medical workers.”In all, Killinchy Primary is accommodating fewer than  pupils.Mr Currie said Mr Weir understood why he had been forced to break with Department of Education policy. “He understood that I had no option,” the primary school teacher added.A spokesperson for the Department of Education said it “is urgently looking at how we can help schools and would urge schools to work together at this time to provide a local solution for the supervision of children of key workers. We are encouraged that some schools are already doing this”.They said the Department was carrying out a daily survey to identy issues and had Education Authority staff “on the ground to assist schools at this time”.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We#re all thinking, #Where do we go from here, what do we do next #We#ve had about  new dog arrivals in the last couple of days, two cats and a bearded dragon - as you do.Ms Matthews said she was relieved that volunteers were still on hand to care for the animals, albeit by working in two-hour shts by themselves.I live on the site so I was worried in case none of the volunteers could get in, she added.There#s no way physically I could look after that many animals.She said getting the public to accept they cannot visit has been a struggle.

Most people are very understanding.

I would remind everyone these measures have been introduced to save lives during this global emergency.Until the new legislation is in place, we will be increasing police patrols in key areas across Northern Ireland to engage with and provide guidance to anyone who contravenes the measures.Dr Bamford also urged the public not to ignore the lockdown measures, which are in place for three weeks, although First Minister Arlene Foster has warned she expected this to be for a longer period of time.He described the lockdown measures as sensible.Hopefully we will see that this stops the spread but we won#t be able to tell for quite a while, Dr Bamford explained.In two or three weeks we#ll be able to see its impact.He said that households remaining indoors could play a signicant role in reducing the number of infections.If we don#t do anything, everyone will probably get infected at some point in the next few months, or years, said Dr Bamford.So essentiallyeveryone stays locked in you could get a serious amount of reduction. At least -fold,not -fold, but onlyeverybody does this.Everyone#s still susceptible, the virus is still out there. I can see thisgoing on for months. Or at least, in some predictions, you can have an intense period of lockdown now, then relieve it, and then lockdown again.But it depends on how people take to that.

They have been told by representatives of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office it is hoped they willon commercial flights rather than a repatriation plane.Some UK passengers did have flights yesterday, but Brazilian authorities said the ship could dock for no more than one day so others, including the Lynches, have no time to make other arrangements with either the travel company, which has so far failed to book any flights, or Foreign Office officials.Everyone in the group is really stressed, Mrs Lynch said. As it is, we think we#re doing one thing, then things change, maybe within a few hours. She added: Passengers have decisions to make, then everything changes again. Jillthinks that because we are all virus-free and well looked after on board, we are not a priority.While Princess Cruises, the ship#s owners, have announced the Coral aims to arrive in Fort Lauderdale on April , there is a hope that a repatriation flight will be arranged to fly out of Barbados in  days. Non-US citizens or permanent residents will almost certainly not be allowed to disembark in Florida.Belfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The UK Government says I must only travel to and from work“absolutely necessary” - how do I knowit is “absolutely necessary” A. All those who are able to work from home have been advised to do so, however for many jobs this is not possible. Those providing essential services or goods will still be able to travel to and from work. Social distancing rules, however, should still be enforced. This means you should stay at least two metres apart from anyone and work gatherings should not take place.Q. Will the children of orced parents be able to visit both of them A. Cabinet minister the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Michael Gove has confirmed that children under  can move between the households of separated parents, as long as this is normal practice.Q.

Those found to be breaking the rules can be subject to prohibition notices and potentially unlimited fines.Q. How long will the restrictions be in place for A. The restrictions will be in place for at least three weeks, at which time they will be reviewed. At this stage they could be relaxed or tightened.Many have speculated that the restrictions will be in force for longer than three weeks, such as First Minister Arlene Foster.“If I was a betting person, I would say it would continue long after three weeks. It is right we review what are quite draconian measures. But I would imagine it will last longer than three weeks,” she said.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: It#s for the best, says Foster as she welcomes Prime Minister#s move to place UK on lockdownArlene Foster has welcomed Boris Johnson#s announcement of draconian new restrictions on everyday le in a bid to tackle the spread of coronavirus.Lindy McDowellOpinionLindy McDowell:Enormity of coronavirus crisis we face is laid bare on day of raw emotion in the AssemblyThese are the choices we are going to have to deal with...

Their two-week honeymoon in Canada has also been cancelled and provisionally replaced with a trip to Iceland and the US.Becca, who turns  tomorrow, says she and Timwere forced to make the dficult decision after further lockdown measures were announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.She said: “I rang the hotel and they only had one Saturday available for the whole of the year on November  so we took it. As much as we would have loved to get married this weekend, we’re not upset but instead excited about our new date. For us the priority was to do the right thing socially to ensure everyone will be safe and well.“The last thing we would have wanted was to go ahead this weekend and put our family and friends at risk. So many of them are nurses and doctors working on the front line,” she said.“We hope to give them a party to remember in November to say thank you for all they’re doing.”Lauren HarteBelfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We all need to pull together to make sure our health services are not overwhelmed by a surge in patient numbers.This is an opportunity we will never have again to flatten the curve. We cannot stop this virus, but everything we are asking you to do is about slowing it down, protecting those most at risk in our community.Our actions now will have a direct impact on the pressure in our health service and its ability to cope with this crisis. Our actions now can protect the most vulnerable and our health workers. Our actions now can save lives.So please choose to stay at home. Choose to wash your hands frequently for  seconds. Choose to save lives.We are both busy mothers with families of our own. We know how worrying this time is for everyone, and we also know how dficult it is to stick to these measures, but they are absolutely necessary.If you are not one of our heroic workers in healthcare, or involved in the delivery of essential services, then think before you step out the door.Do you really need to go to the shops or can it wait  Our food supply arrangements are robust. They are made stronger when people show restraint and allow others a fair share. Panic-buying and bulk-buying only serves to leave vulnerable people without.Of course it#s right to want to be in the fresh air and get exercise, but let everyone have a turn, go out once a day and keep your distance.If you need to get prescriptions or other vital goods for those who are unable, keep trips to a minimum.We all have a personal responsibility to get behind this effort. We appeal to young people and their parents, please do the right thing. None of us will get another chance at this.Emergency powers will allow us to enforce measures to ensure people stick to the rules, but we should not have to use them.Our whole community must unite as never before. That is what we in the Executive are doing. We are working right across government and society to do everything we can to beat this.This is an anxious time, we know, for many people - particularly the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. The best protection we can offer them is staying away. Keep in touch and provide whatever support you can from afar.We know that coronavirus will cost more lives. We also know that by taking action and following the advice, together, we can reduce deaths by up to a third. Each death caused by this disease will bring devastation to their family, friends and loved ones. Don#t bring that hurt to another person#s door.

At Home … We all love being at home, love the homes we have made, love being with our children and families.But to be restricted to being at home can be dficult, to be advised to stay at home and have our normal routine change can be stressful as we wonder how best to manage and live as normal.So here are a few ideas to help keep you sane, to still enjoy your days and be positive …Working at home  Is dficult at the best of times as the washing calls to be put on the line, the dog looks adoringly at you for a walk, the sun and garden beckon etc.But now with your children off too it’s about to get even harder, with demands for play, shouts of I’m bored, he took my doll, she keeps standing in front of the TV.So why not set up a new routine, plan your day to incorporate activities with the children and work time too.Yes you may have to work later than . pm as you’ll be doing less during usual office hours but at least you will get work done.Do explain that you do have to work, and then try activities with them for an hour and then work for an hour, or set up tasks and play activities they can do themselves play dough, creation station, jigsaws, a video about the natural world etc.If you have little ones at home, those under three years, it’s even harder but maybe your teenagers could help If not then you’ll have to adapt the routine to maybe work for half an hour and then play, or set up a play stationnext to you and you can work together.If you have a partner at home maybe you could set up an office in the bedroom or dining room and take it in turns to work and play  Many schools and nurseries have provided work packs for your children to do.Don’t be tempted to rush through these all in one go, do what their teacher suggests.There are many websites who have learning resources you can access too such as The National Literacy Trust’s Family Zone or Twinklwho have a parents page full of resources for those with children aged from birth.I’ll be sharing lots of the ideas and links from these two sites plus more on my Facebook pageas too much information and too many ideas can be overwhelming!Stock Up, forget the toilet roll and tins!Stock up on glue, crayons, pencils, paint, paper , colouring or activity books and real books too, card, sequins and glitter , flour, salt, food colouring, cake making ingredients, bubbles, cornflour for gloop, jelly for jelly play, bag of sand etc!I know most of us already have a Facebook page and use Whats App but do your parents and their friends I know my mum would be ‘gulp’ why do I need them.But these social media sites will ensure that we are all able to keep in touch with each other, that your Mum and mine will be able to see, her Bowling Buddies, your Mums Knit  Natter friends and this ‘keeping in touch’ will be so very importantthey, and we, can’t go out.So do take the time to teach them and their friends as well, maybe consider too using and showing them how to use Skype or Face Time - it’s great to talk but even better to talk and see each other too!Busy, wondering how exactly you are going to keep busy stuck in the house all day Do the ‘jobs’ you’ve been putting off for the past few years!Plan to decorate, spring clean, learn to sew or knitbuild a pond, sort out the garden or, like me get ready to paint your shed yellow!Can you help anyone  An elderly neighbour, the new mum next door, the single dad who has to work in the hospital, the old lady down the road who now can’t walk her dog, the food bank delivery service  It’s greatyou can, just remember though to protect yourself and your family. Invest in two or three garden chairs or benches, old or new it doesn’t matter, pop them by your fences so you and your neighbours can talk to each other! Talk, Sing, Read And Play with your children every day - with all this time at home there’s no excuse not to! googletag.cmd.push Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

To order, telephone .Foyle Food Bank has seen a surge in demand and has encouraged anyone in need to come forward.Denis McGowan, chairman, said: Shopping in the food bank’s supermarketand access to its cafehas had to be suspended and instead users are asked to present their food bank vouchers outside the premises and food parcels will then be brought to their car by volunteers.Mr McGowan asked that those issuing food bank vouchers continue to ensure that all donated food goes to those in genuine need. Such controls are necessary in spite of the pressures of these challenging times but anyone in food crisis, particularly those who now find themselves in this situation for the first time, should not delay in coming to us, he said.

Nobody has all the right answers so it’s imperative that we all work together.

From this evening people must stay at home except for shopping for basic necessities, daily exercise, any medical need and travelling to and from essential work. Shops selling non-essential goods will also be shut and gatherings in public of more than two people who do not live together prohibited. The UK death toll has reached . It was announced this evening that a third person has died from the disease in Northern Ireland. If people do not follow the rules police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings, Boris Johnson said in a televised statement from Downing Street. googletag.cmd.push The Department of Health said the third patient to die in Northern Ireland was in their late sixties and had underlying health conditions. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “My heart goes out to the loved ones of this patient. “This is the third tragic announcement of this kind I have had to make in recent days. “The lethal threat from this virus is very real and we all have to do everything we can to combat it.” Below is Boris Johnstons full address this evening:  Good Evening, The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades – and this country is not alone. googletag.cmd.push All over the world we are seeing the devastating impact of this invisible killer. And so tonight I want to update you on the latest steps we are taking to fight the disease and what you can do to help. And I want to begin by reminding you why the UK has been taking the approach that we have. Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope because there won’t be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses. And as we have seen where, in other countries that also have fantastic health care systems, that is the moment of real danger. To put it simply,too many people become seriously unwell at one time, the NHS will be unable to handle it – meaning more people are likely to die, not just from coronavirus but from other illnesses as well. So it’s vital to slow the spread of the disease. Because that is the way we reduce the number of people needing hospital treatment at any one time, so we can protect the NHS’s ability to cope – and save more lives. And that’s why we have been asking people to stay at home during this pandemic. And though huge numbers are complying – and I thank you all – the time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home. Because the critical thing we must do is stop the disease spreading between households. That is why people will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes: – shopping for basic necessities, as infrequently as possible – one form of exercise a day – for example a run, walk, or cycle – alone or with members of your household – any medical need, to provide care or to help a vulnerable person and – travelling to and from work, but only where this is absolutely necessary and cannot be done from home. That’s all – these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say No. You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home. You should not be going shopping except for essentials like food and medicine — and you should do this as little as you can. And use food delivery services where you can. If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings. To ensure compliance with the Government’s instruction to stay at home, we will immediately: – close all shops selling non-essential goods, including clothing and electronic stores and other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship – we will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public – excluding people you live with – and we’ll stop all social events , including weddings, baptisms and other ceremonies, but excluding funerals. Parks will remain open for exercise but gatherings will be dispersed. No Prime Minister wants to enact measures like this. I know the damage that this disruption is doing and will do to people’s lives, to their businesses and to their jobs. And that’s why we have produced a huge and unprecedented programme of support both for workers and for business. And I can assure you that we will keep these restrictions under constant review. We will look again in three weeks, and relax themthe evidence shows we are able to. But at present there are just no easy options. The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost. And yet it is also true that there is a clear way through. Day by day we are strengthening our amazing NHS with , former clinicians now coming back to the service. With the time you buy – by simply staying at home – we are increasing our stocks of equipment. We are accelerating our search for treatments. We are pioneering work on a vaccine. And we are buying millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer. I want to thank everyone who is working flat out to beat the virus. Everyone from the supermarket staff to the transport workers to the carers to the nurses and doctors on the frontline. But in this fight we can be in no doubt that each and every one of us is directly enlisted. Each and every one of us is now obliged to join together, to halt the spread of this disease, to protect our NHS and to save many many thousands of lives. And I know that as they have in the past so many times, the people of this country will rise to that challenge. And we will come through it stronger than ever. We will beat the coronavirus and we will beat it together. And therefore I urge you at this moment of national emergency to stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.

The date for a potentialto League of Ireland action was set by the Football Association of Ireland and the National League Executive Committee this past weekend in the wake of the Covid- pandemic.The decision was made at a tele-conference conducted from FAI HQ at Abbotstown on Friday, with all  League clubs represented. Both parties agreed to work together to play as many games as possible this season to minimise the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on attendances and sponsorship, and to consider the needs of clubs who have qualied for Europe.The new plan is based around UEFA guidelines on ato club action across Europe, as presented to the FAI last Tuesday. This decision will see the Premier Division and the First Division of the SSE Airtricity League resume on the weekend commencing Friday, June . The Premier Division will finish on Friday, December  and the SSE Airtricity League season will close on Friday, December , with the second leg of the promotion relegation play-off. The Extra.ie FAI Cup Final will go ahead as scheduled on November , whilst the EA SPORTS Cup will be deferred.The new schedule will require the cancellation of the last round of fixtures in the Premier Division, now reduced to  games in total. Changes to the dates for European club fixtures may force alterations to the new calendar of games as the season develops and this will be continually reviewed.The First Division clubs will examine the possibility of fulfilling their -game schedule within this timeframe from June to December.Welcoming the decision, FAI Competitions Director Fran Gavin said: “These are very dficult times for our clubs and players and the FAI remains committed to doing everything we can to get us all through this crisis together.“There are no certainties around the COVID- pandemic but this decision offers us something to aim for. UEFA hope to have European football back up and running by early June at the latest so June  is a realistic target for us at this moment in time.“Together with the clubs and the Professional Footballer’s Association of Ireland, we will work together towards this date and continue to liaise with the NLEC and the PFAI to protect our clubs and players as best we can.“The FAI will continue to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to prioritise the health of our players, match officials, supporters and staff at this time and we will continue to follow all government guidelines.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Gone are the days of rounding up your friends for a knock-out on the nearest piece of grass you could find. Remember headers and volleys   seconds  Last Man standing  How about playing asyou were your childhood idol whilst the sun beat down and the grass stains got on the knees of your jeans. That meant that you got your arse warmed for you by your ma because the grass stains were hard to get out. I was Mark Hughes day in and day out and was the one who could be often found trying to score overhead kicks of the Sparky iety. It wasnt just football. If you fancied a game of rounders, you welcomed anyone and everyone, andit wasnt sports related, it would have been a game of Knick-Knock, which involved knocking on some poor neighbours door and making a run for it . Another classic – Pomp Pomp, involved one person standing with their eyes closed at a lamp post whilst everyone  hid, with the purpose of ing to said lamp post to free yourself. Speed was your friend in that game, a clown who never went further than ten feet from the lamp post was the enemy.The common denominator was that we were all outside playing, all day every day, and there wasnt an evening passed when someone was called in for their bed and there began vocerous negotiations across the street MAMMY, CAN I JUST HAVE ANOTHER  MINUTES . Glorious days. Really.To kids today, its an alien concept.This coronavirus craic is no craic at all, but it has made me, as a parent of two wains that would rather stay in watching TV than breathe fresh air, dig deep for creativity. With the sun shining, I took the two of them to Malinhead on Friday, and whilst I feared they would be bored within  minutes, they actually had a ball of a time, both simultaneously and spontaneously developing an interest in amateur photography. That shared interest gave way to a miracle of sorts as well – they stopped narking at each other. It was glorious peace, for them. I was having all sorts of panic attacks because they were getting far too close to the clf edges for my liking. Of course they were nowhere near them, but my eyesight isnt what it was andI said Careful once, I must have said it  times. Mortality hits you right in the face when you become a parent – and that irrationality never leaves you. I still check them to seetheyre breathing at night, and probably will until they get their own places. googletag.cmd.push HighlightMalinhead was great, and the fresh air did a number on them as they were wrecked when they got back in the car. Yet the real highlight of the day came before Malinhead, when I took them outside for an old school game of padsy.Now, you may call it padsy, or you may call it kerby, either way, you know what Im talking about. What you may not remember is that it is brilliant craic and in these scary times, a le saver.The rules are simple, and perfect for social distancing,thats your thing with your own wains. One person stands on one side of the road, facing the other, each taking turns to throw a ball. If it hits the opposite curb you get  points and you get to stand in the middle of the road for possible -pointers.It is simple and it is fun, butyoure a competitive sort, it also scratches that itch. Finding myself losing badly to my -year old daughter, I opted for desperation, turning my back and throwing it over my head in the hope of a -pointer. I also found myself hoping for the Ultimate shot - throwing the ball over a passing car and hitting the curb to win the game outright - the fabled -pointer. Those shots are for the talented or desperate, and I was the latter. Not once did I succeed. But sure at least I tried, with my daughter feeling more and more sorry for me with every beating.I did manage to claim a victory over my son, but that was neck and neck as well, and I have a feeling that he, like his sister, pitied the old fool and gave him a sympathy win.I discovered two things playing a game I played a thousand times as a Ballymac youngster – My -pointer game is now atrocious, and thats even with my glasses on. Also, a persistent leg problem prevented me from bending down to pick up the ball with any grace at all. If there was ever a sign Im getting old, it slapped me right up the face in those moments.But enough griping – my leg is sore, my hair is grey and my eyesight is shot, but the smiles were on my wains faces, and thats all that mattered. I left them playing amongst themselves whilst I talked to a neighbour about the worry affecting us all. They played on, innocently, competitively and obliviously. Thats all that mattered.They were kids being kids.Like we all were at one time.All you need is a ball. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Another classic – Pomp Pomp, involved one person standing with their eyes closed at a lamp post whilst everyone  hid, with the purpose of ing to said lamp post to free yourself. Speed was your friend in that game, a clown who never went further than ten feet from the lamp post was the enemy.The common denominator was that we were all outside playing, all day every day, and there wasnt an evening passed when someone was called in for their bed and there began vocerous negotiations across the street MAMMY, CAN I JUST HAVE ANOTHER  MINUTES . Glorious days. Really.To kids today, its an alien concept.This coronavirus craic is no craic at all, but it has made me, as a parent of two wains that would rather stay in watching TV than breathe fresh air, dig deep for creativity. With the sun shining, I took the two of them to Malinhead on Friday, and whilst I feared they would be bored within  minutes, they actually had a ball of a time, both simultaneously and spontaneously developing an interest in amateur photography. That shared interest gave way to a miracle of sorts as well – they stopped narking at each other. It was glorious peace, for them. I was having all sorts of panic attacks because they were getting far too close to the clf edges for my liking. Of course they were nowhere near them, but my eyesight isnt what it was andI said Careful once, I must have said it  times. Mortality hits you right in the face when you become a parent – and that irrationality never leaves you. I still check them to seetheyre breathing at night, and probably will until they get their own places. googletag.cmd.push HighlightMalinhead was great, and the fresh air did a number on them as they were wrecked when they got back in the car. Yet the real highlight of the day came before Malinhead, when I took them outside for an old school game of padsy.Now, you may call it padsy, or you may call it kerby, either way, you know what Im talking about. What you may not remember is that it is brilliant craic and in these scary times, a le saver.The rules are simple, and perfect for social distancing,thats your thing with your own wains. One person stands on one side of the road, facing the other, each taking turns to throw a ball. If it hits the opposite curb you get  points and you get to stand in the middle of the road for possible -pointers.It is simple and it is fun, butyoure a competitive sort, it also scratches that itch. Finding myself losing badly to my -year old daughter, I opted for desperation, turning my back and throwing it over my head in the hope of a -pointer. I also found myself hoping for the Ultimate shot - throwing the ball over a passing car and hitting the curb to win the game outright - the fabled -pointer. Those shots are for the talented or desperate, and I was the latter. Not once did I succeed. But sure at least I tried, with my daughter feeling more and more sorry for me with every beating.I did manage to claim a victory over my son, but that was neck and neck as well, and I have a feeling that he, like his sister, pitied the old fool and gave him a sympathy win.I discovered two things playing a game I played a thousand times as a Ballymac youngster – My -pointer game is now atrocious, and thats even with my glasses on. Also, a persistent leg problem prevented me from bending down to pick up the ball with any grace at all. If there was ever a sign Im getting old, it slapped me right up the face in those moments.But enough griping – my leg is sore, my hair is grey and my eyesight is shot, but the smiles were on my wains faces, and thats all that mattered. I left them playing amongst themselves whilst I talked to a neighbour about the worry affecting us all. They played on, innocently, competitively and obliviously. Thats all that mattered.They were kids being kids.Like we all were at one time.All you need is a ball. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In light of a rapidly changing situation, we recommend that people consult our Facebook page through the week.This week  people ran, jogged and walked the course, of whom  were first timers and  recorded new personal bests.

I also think it is ludicrous that you only have schools and public buildings closed on one side of the border, he said.ldquoI know that from talking to parents last weekend, especially those with vulnerable children, that they are really fearful about sending them to school and into public buildings. People are effectively voting with their feet and taking decisions themselves.Cllr Clarke said elected representatives had to listen to what the public was saying and that confusion had been fuelled by conflicting medical advice from across the globe.He added: ldquoWe simply have to look at restrictions on public buildings and even perhaps how many people go into play parks. This council needs to send out a strong message that it is taking this issue seriously following. We have already cancelled of this weekrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parades. We have to start by getting our own house in order.The DUPrsquos Billy Walker mdash who initially said that his party would ldquoreluctantly support the closure of leisure centres mdash subsequently agreed that all council buildings should go into lockdown following the Prime Ministerrsquos statement.He said that in the interests of the publicrsquos health and safety ldquothis is the right thing to do, even though Northern Irelandrsquos chief medical officer, Michael McBride, said that leisure centres could remain openthey were properly managed.ldquoAll the political parties need to work together to make sure that the people out there are properly informed as there are mixed messages. To be honest, some have attempted to turn this issue into and Orange and Green situation and that is wrong, declared Cllr Walker.ldquoThe bottom line for us all is that we do not want any member of the public to get infected with this virus. We want to come out the far side of this crisis unscathed and prevent as many as people as possible from contracting coronavirus. We have to send out a united message.The UUPrsquos David Taylor said while politicians could ldquodebate all day about who was right and who was wrong in relation to conflicting medical advice, they had to approach the issue in a collective manner and give confidence to the community that they are united in their approach.He added: ldquoThis is not a political issue. It is one that affects each and everyone of us. It is a very serious issue given the potential damage it could cause to peoplersquos lives and we could actually lose some as a result of this. We need to take collective approach and act responsibly.ldquoI have serious concerns about the way the virus is impacting the business community and some of the stories I have heard are frightening, with some businesses down by as much as  percent and jobs at others at risk. We need the Assembly to provide a package of measures to help.SDLP councillor Pete Byrne said that at this time the public need clarity with the overwhelming majority of them of the view that acting early is better than acting too late.ldquoPeople want us to show leadership and while we are taking about closing leisure centres, we have an obligation to protect the interests and health of people and our staff, he said.ldquoWhile I support the closure of leisure centres, we also need to look at community centres, many of which are visited by huge number of our senior citizens for a range of activities and programmes. We need to send out a clear message to people.Cllr Byrne said there also needed to be a focus on the criteria for reopening public buildings following their closure, suggesting that an alternative venue needs to be found for future council meetings to promote social distancing, suggesting the Down Leisure Centre as a possible location.ldquoWhen we close public facilities we are going to push people into parks but we must ensure that there is social distancing in these locations. We need staff there to assure people and perhaps we could redeploy those from our leisure centres to make sure are parks are up to scratch, he added.Cllr Henry Reilly highlighted the great deal of anguish in the community, suggesting that a two-week closure smacked of ldquotokenism as the coronavirus issue will not be over by the end of March.He also highlighted the need to ensure that frontline staff, especially those who work in refuse collection and household recycling centres, are provided with appropriate protective equipment.Cllr Jarlath Tinnelly urged the Public Health Agency to provide information leaflets on the coronavirus to every household in the country, while Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray said his party supported the decision to close all council buildings, excluding those which deliver statutory s.He added: ldquoMoving forward, it is imperative that we enact and support the decision made by the council. On the wider issue, I would ask all residents to follow the advice given by the Public Health Agency, to shop responsibility in order to avoid shortages and to look out for the most vulnerable in our

contact.Volunteers from the foodbank, who are appealing for more donations to help them cope with the increase in demand in what are unprecedented times, are asking people with cars to drive into the car park at Downpatrick Presbyterian Church where the foodbank is based.People are being asked to remain in their cars and once they have handed over their voucher, the food parcel will either be left beside their vehicle or placed in the boot.The volunteers have confirmed that they will also be changing the way they hand over parcels to people who arrive at the foodbank on foot or accept the generous donations people from across the district provide them with.Foodbank co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said people continue to be generous and revealed that she was heartened this week to see collection points the charity has at a number of local stores filled with items.She also revealed that while in the Asdarsquos Downpatrick store yesterday morning, she was approached by a woman who gave her an envelope with money it which her grandfather had donated.Shirley explained the woman approached her after spotting that she was wearing her Fountain Foodbank hoodie.Shirley has been at the helm of the foodbank since it opened and described the impact of the coronavirus issue on the community as ldquochallenging.She also confirmed that the volunteers who provide the food parcel service are committed to continuing to help others across the community in need.She described the climate the foodbank is currently operating in as ldquodficult and revealed that it was extremely busy last Friday.ldquoOn Tuesday of last week we gave out  food parcels which was busy but not unusual, but suddenly on Friday everyone seemed to panic and there were  parcels given out to help  people.ldquoTo put that number of parcels in context, it was like the Friday before Christmas when we give out around  parcels. This is the only time that we would distribute that many.Shirley said she believes that this is as a direct response to what is happening across the community, explaining that measures had been put in place to restrict the time volunteers speak with people in a bid to protect their health.ldquoWhile I was not there last Friday when people were calling I believe that there was a sombre atmosphere. We gave out a lot of food and we reckon that we will be busy from here on, she continued.ldquoIt has been dficult to replace the food that was given out. We do not have that big a store, but we have managed and it is quite well stocked again just now, but it is dficult. Normally we have financial donations which lets me buy what we need, but there is no long le milk to be had anywhere. It has been hard for me to do that normal shopping for the foodbank.Shirley explained that while she collected an order from the Asda store in Downpatrick yesterday, she was unable to get the quantity of some items that she would have liked.The foodbank co-ordinator saidshoppers would think about the charity when they are shopping it would help, explaining that people are being good, with messages coming in from people saying they will make donations. Shirley said that local churches have also been helping.ldquoThere has been a good response from people which is very much appreciated, but the increase in demand is having an impact on our stock, coupled with the inability to get the food, she said.ldquoPeople should not be panic buying, but it seems to be the way they react at times like this.She said that the Downpatrick foodbank and the Pantry foodbank in Newcastle are anticipating greater need and with people having no jobs and no money coming in, ldquothey are going to be in more dficulty.Shirley added: ldquoEveryone who used the foodbank over the past few months do not have the reserves to go and panic buy, that is why we are going to be busy.Donations can be left at the Fountain Foodbank on Tuesday or Friday mornings between am and noon.

The distance is approximately six miles on an out and back course, majority of the race on the flat with a brutal climb of  feet in half a mile.A new registration venue meant a slight course change which avoided the road section, crossing a few fields and down a lane that took competitors back onto the river path.Leading out the runners was Newcastle ACrsquos Seamus Lynch and Mourne Runnersrsquo Johnny Scott. Once on to the open mountain section, Lynch showed his climbing ability with a one minute lead at the summit before descending with devastating effect, leaving the opposition in his wake and an easy run home along the river bank.The rest of the field swapped places as everyone fought for grip on the steep mountain side.In the ladiesrsquo race it was Newry ACrsquos Esther Dickson who dominated, showing many a good fell runner a clean pair of heels on the descent.At the end of the track back along the river it was Lynch, well in the lead taking his fourth win and third in a row in :, Scott held his position for second in : closely followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Adam Cunningham in :.Making the top ten for NAC were David Hicks in seventh place in : and Gary McEvoy ninth in :. Also running for NAC was Stevie Rice, finishing in : for th place. The ladiesrsquo race was won by Dickson for the fourth time in a row in : followed by Mourne Runnersrsquo Karalee McBride in : and third was Ballydrain Harriersrsquo Alison Stocks in :.Following on from last weekendrsquos Slieve Gullion race, Newcastle AC again won the team prize.The silly boy award this week went to Hicks, who very nearly wasnrsquot allowed to start the race, having turned up without his mandatory safety kit bag.His only excuse was: ldquoOn ing from injury and a year out, Irsquom just getting back into the swing of things.Fortunately, a quick scramble around the start area saw him beg and borrow enough gear to be allowed to start the race.

steady hand on the tiller”, and he also praised the “selfless” health workers who are keeping the hospitals running.He askedthe new powers will be able to compel factories to close for example, saying that he had been speaking to workers on assembly lines who were labouring effectively “shoulder to shoulder”, saying: “That makes a mockery of all were told about social distancing, yet what is the capacity to deal with that ”Mr Allister then went on to add: “If it comes to it, and things get as bad as is feared, are we going to be fettered in any way in calling in the necessary support of the Army in this part of the UK “There certainly shouldn’t be, but is there  If we get to the point where our hospitals, particularly near the border, are being overrun by people outside the jurisdiction, anxious for help, are there steps we can or would or should take in that regard  Are there powers in this bill that would allow the minister to act to deal with that extreme situation ”He hoped any decision to deploy soldiers will not be “trumped by politics”.His address was interrupted twice once by Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd who accused him of being “provocative”, and by DUP MLA Christopher Stalford who recalled that in  at the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, “the army was deployed to help deliver essential supplies” and that was a time when the devolved government “included all parties – so there’s no legitimate reason why people could object”.Addressing the points, Mr Swann told the Assembly: “The [coronavirus] bill provides for enforcement of the measures of closing premises and prohibiting gathering... these measures and enforcement powers focus on the owners and occupiers of premises and organisers of events they do not target inidual people, however foolish they may be, who choose to ignore advice and attend events”.He added “Members I recognise that this may not be enoughinidual people do not heed the instruction and continue to behave in a way that puts their own health and that of others at risk.“Soadditional measures are needed such as fixed penalty notices to deal with iniduals who behave irresponsibly then with the agreement of my executive colleagues we will not hesitate to introduce them.”He said whilst he is actively curbing people’s liberty in doing so, he said the greatest liberty any person enjoys is the freedom to live.He went on to add: “Will I use the army  Will I call in the armyI have to “If we get to a stage where they can provide a service that we can’t, folks I’ll use whoever is at my disposal.“I’ll use whatever tool I have at my disposal to tackle this virus.“If the Irish Army want to come up and help us too, when they’ve it sorted down there, I’d be more than happy to welcome them. “So folks lets not let this debate or this issue be politicised.”Earlier in the day the News Letter had asked Sinn FeinMichelle O’Neill and her other ministers would accept the deployment of the armyit is deemed necessary.The party said: “There are no plans or need for British military personnel to be deployed onto the streets.“The civil contingency group has been established by the Executive. “This comprises all of the key public sector agencies, Councils and blue light services in co-ordinating the response to this covid- emergency.“The support to aid the civil authorities is considered to be sufficient.”\"\" for

It is evident that the church has little or no interest in the public worship of God. What God has commanded is now seen as mere lip service. The Headship of Christ is now openly denied.Letter to the editor : Johnston Press Resell \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...What is equally troubling is that these buildings were erected for the preaching of the gospel. That is now publicly denied.In addition, the planned closure for months indicates the church is effectively irrelevant even to its members and adherents. More troubling are those who within the church are demanding the closures thereby demonstrating that the vast majority of worshippers are unconverted. Equally troubling is the future.If the church has collapsed on this issue, then it will be no surprise that it will equally collapse under persecution.God has tested the public professing church of Christ and it has been found wanting. Exposed as nothing more than pop-Christianity. Also exposed is the  message of healing. All such services have been cancelled to avoid close contact! How pathetic. Rather than close, there should be a dozen services in every building. When I see the elderly who came through a letime of storms bemused at all the snowflakes whose theology is incapable of getting them to church, it is little wonder the buildings are closed. Without a shot being fired or anyone burned at the stake, Christians in general have run away. The backbone of the Puritans and the Covenanters, of Knox and Calvin, does not exist in the Church today. They have all become marshmallows.The church has been judged. It has failed. The crown rights of the Redeemer have been tarnished.

I think I am more of a hindrance to be honest.“I’ve one kid who’s not very well behaved so he’s been reprimanded a few times”With so much experience of being isolated in a small flat ahead of fights, Frampton said it is important for people to use the phone and to facetime call family and friends regularly during the current coronavirus crisis.“I think that is going to be very important in getting us through this,” he added.On Twitter he posted the hard-hitting message: “This is not the time to be stupid and selfish.

Michael said: “People think, the music is dark and intense, they’re going to be really dark and intense.The band’s original line-up of Michael, Andy and Fyfe \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...“The most messed-up people I find are people in pop music. A lot of them are horrible twisted people with weird agendas and they become quite damaged iniduals. Then they go on stage everything is rosy.“It’s really the old cliche – never judge a book by its cover. With us the lyrics are kind of twisted, but there’s a big, dark sense of humour there.“We let off steam when we go on stage and jump up and down for  minutes. You tend to be pretty chilled afterwards.”When the band first got together in  lead singer and guitarist Andy Cairns was a pupil at Ballyclare High. Michael, who attended Larne Grammar with Fyfe Ewing , wasn’t present for the band’s first recording though he was there in spirit.On the front cover of metal magazine Kerrang! in He said: “Fyfe and I were in the same English class and would have traded records. He was in a band, I was in a band. “His band and Andy’s band had played a gig at Jordanstown Uni. They had more in common than they did with their own bands. “They did a demo together. I was there in spirit because Andy didn’t have a bass guitar so Fyfe asked me and I lent Andy my bass. Andy played it on the first demo.” Michael soon joined to play his own bass and things clicked from the start: “Our first gig was at Giro’s supporting Decadence Within. It went down really well, I was flabbergasted. “We weren’t trying to be U or Guns N’ Roses – those were the two big musical things at that time in , . I don’t mind U and I quite like Guns N’ Roses but we had our own little thing going on.“You kind of gravitated towards anyone who liked something that wasn’t Bryan Adams at school. In Larne where I grew up the metallers hung out with the goths, the goths hung out with the indie kids and you heard Joy Division, The Dead Kennedys and Slayer. We clung together as musical outsiders.”The friendship between Michael and Andy has extended more than  years: “I think I was  or  when Andy and I first met. When the first album came out I’d just turned . I’ll be  later this month.“One thing we did find quite early on is that we tend to be huffers. We got that out of our system. If you don’t like something you say then, you don’t leave it for six months and have a meltdown in the middle of eastern Europe.“There’s a lot of rock and rolls myths and stereotypes out there that people love. One of them I think which is not correct is that you need to have creative tension in a band. Maybe that’s works for one or two albums, but that burns itself out really quickly.“It’s really great working together as part of the band, what I get out of it is quite special, I think I’m very lucky.”Michael contrasted the crazy intensity when the band shared a house together in Belfast’s Holylandswith the situation now where they all live in dferent parts of the UK.He said: “I think there was one time me and Andy worked out over an -months period we’d been within  metres of each other every day with the exception of Christmas Day.“Now I live in Larne, Andy lives in Cambridge and Neilour drummer lives in Derby. When we meet up there’s lots of interesting stories and dferent experiences to share rather than walk down the main street in Larne going, ‘oh there’s the lads’.”On Fyfe, his original bandmate who left in , he said: “I haven’t spoken to him since he left. We have friends in common. He’s doing alright I believe. He moved to Brighton, he’s been there  years now. He’s had very little involvement in the music business.“It’s a real pity because he was such a great drummer, it’s just he couldn’t really get on with the lestyle. Somewhere down the line we’ll meet again.”Family man with attic of collectablesLast year Michael contributed a recipe to a celebrity cookbook to support his nephew Matthew who had been diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia.Michael said: “Matthew is doing well. The family is getting things back on track. It was a big thing, he’s still a bit traumatised as you’d expect but he’s doing well.”Of family le at home in Larne he said: “My we works full time soI’m at home I’m daddy day care. The only downside is when I’m away, I’m away   so there’s a whole dferent set of challenges for my we who’s an absolute saint.”Askedhis children, aged nine and five, were excited about their dad being in an band, he said: “They saw us at a big festival in Europe which was great because they were at the side of the stage and they were able to see , people from the other side. “They’re quite blasé about their dad being in a band. They’re not into music that much, they’re more into games, football and karate.”Michael went on to discuss some of the Therapy  treasure trovecontained in his attic: “I’ve got Fyfe’s original snare drum that he used on Babyteeth, the basses that I used on Troublegum. I’ve got a lot of the flyers, posters, tour passes and recordings and audio stuff I’ve kept over the years. The attic is a disaster area.”In the early days of Therapy  a pair of denim dungarees were Michael’s stagewear of choice. Askedstill had them, he said: “I actually do. I’m quite pleased that I’d still fit into them but I never wear them.“When we did the Troublegum shows a while ago there were some bets that they’d turn up again, but it didn’t happen for whatever reason. But never say never – right now I don’t think the world is ready for that.”Michael explained that there were in fact two pairs of his trademark dungarees, one of them he referred to as ‘the good pair’ then immediately burst out laughing.“Can you imagine denim dungarees after three weeks of touring ” he said. “It’s hard to find a -hour laundrette when you’re on the road. They were crunchy. I’m surprised they’re still in one piece.”Dates cancelled due to pandemicTherapy  have had to cancel some European tour dates later this month because of the coronavirus.Michael said: “We’ve had to cancel where the crowds would have been above ,, some of the big festivals we were really looking forward to. As it stands we’re still planning to play some of the smaller shows unless told otherwise. “It’s something that you just can’t account for. Gigs sometimes have to be cancelled because of illness or injury but this is beyond the band’s control. It’s a bit of a headmelt.”Touring major European cities is a far cry from the band’s gigging schedule in : “When we started there was the Warzone Collective in Belfast and Hope Promotions in Dublin. They worked in conjunction and would bring hardcore punk bands over like Fugazi and Concrete Sox. “We knew the Warzone people and that led to us being invited down to Dublin to play with the likes of Babes In Toyland. “They’d rent rooms above pubs for gigs, in Belfast they used the Art College and the Conor Hall. “We were quite lucky to get in at that DIY stage.”It’s okay not to be okayMuch is currently being done to raise awareness and funds for musicians suffering from mental health issues, particularly through Aware NI, PIPS and Help Musicians. As a band Therapy  have been tuned into the struggle from day one with many of Andy’s lyrics exploring the pressures that weigh on the human mind.Michael said: “It’s something that we’re all very aware of and very sympathetic towards. Being a young male in Northern Ireland there’s a bit of a ‘come on, man up’ vibe. That has been very damaging for a couple of generations now.“There is a rock and roll myth that everyone’s an all-singing, all-dancing, all-fighting gunslinger – you roll into town decimate it and move on. It’s not really like that.“I don’t think anyone hasn’t been touched by themselves or someone  who has had a mental health issue.“It’s such a fragile thing. It’s right there, there just seems not to be the widespread acknowledgement that it exists and for treatment. It’s so underfunded. It’s a real tragedy.”He added: “We’ve always had a lot of empathy, we take people as they are, we don’t have the answers, but we do try to let people know that it’s okay to not be okay. “Just talk about it, talk to your friends, talk to someone, reach out. Thankfully that stigma is moving away.“We’ve always been celebrating the outsiders – be yourself, do you own thing, what makes you happy, self preservation, looking after yourself.”Michael continued: “It’s one of these rock and roll myths that people want their musicians to be messed up and die young and leave a pretty corpse. “None of us subscribe to that at all.“We like to have a good time when we’re on tour, but doing it for so long there’s a massive element of self preservation.“It’s about doing a good gig. People don’t come and see you againyou’re stood there looking bored or hungover. It’s not pleasant for anyone – the player or the watcher.“We all feel a big responsibility to put on a good show. There’s people who have seen us  plus times.“We want every show to be as goodnot better than the last time. You make a rod for your own back with that.”• Therapy  will play the Limelight on September  to celebrate the band’s th anniversary• To coincide with the ‘So Much for the  Year Plan’ tour the band re-recorded  of their UK Top  hits in Abbey Road with producer Chris Sheldon, who produced the original Troublegum album.

If at all accurate, it is remarkable – a total of , equates to one person in , of China’s . billion population .One way to interpret the array of Covid- statistics is to multiply official figures for infections by at least .  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

If lockdowns have kept it to a million, they have worked.Or is China just lying on a huge scale  It is the most repressive of the world’s richest countries, and it cruelly pursued whistleblowers in Wuhan.There are two problems with the lying explanation.The first is: why then did it give accurate data at first  Perhaps it decided after a certain point to lie to prevent panic. Butso, why has the World Health Organisationnot even hinted at concerns  It might be that China has lied on an industrial scale and WHO has just missed it, in which case it too will face big questions after this crisis.The second problem with the theory of lying is why are we not hearing of horrying death levels  If, say, % of China had coronavirusthat is  million people. A million or so would be dead.You would expect that to seep out. Wuhan showed that people tend not to fear police seizing their video phonethey or a loved one are dying. And even China cannot monitor emails of a billion people .It seems more likely that while the real number of cases in China might be a million plus, lockdown has nonetheless worked. Evenso, China faces disasterlockdown ends and a handful of infected people trigger a new outbreak.One country that is widely believed to be lying is Iran. As of yesterday it had , cases, , deaths. Reports as far back as early March of overwhelmed hospitals and mass graves suggest it had penetrated Iran’s  million population to a larger extent even then than statistics show for now.Another method to assess the scale of the virus is to work backwards from number of deaths. If coronavirus does have a % fatality rate, then multiply the number of deaths by  and you get to a minimum infection figure.Iran would have ,+ cases . Italy, with , dead would have , cases.But even in western countries that have accurate death tolls it is probably best to multiply by an even higher multiple than  in order to estimate case levels, due to a time lag before deathsand the fact that even honest recording systems can miss the real reason for some deaths.Last week the former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt suggested , cases for each death and the UK chief scientic advisor Patrick Vallance called that “a reasonable ballpark”.If so, then the UK with  deaths has almost , infections, Northern Ireland with  deaths has , and the Republic with  has ,.This is far more plausible than the UK’s supposed , cases or NI’s . It explains why many of us now know people who are infected .The low UK stat is in part due to the fact it is testing far less than, say, Germany, and helps explain the far higher German ratio of cases to deaths . Yet even Germany, on a x, ratio, has far more cases than it has yet found.On the same ratio, Italy would have millions of cases .If we apply the x, ratio to the world, it is approaching  million cases, still far short of worst case scenarios of majority infections .If this is all evidence that lockdown works, then it is not hard to see why it works. Statisticians have pointed out that in a normal flu every person infects . people, which is  people at  steps . Coronavirus every person infects  people, which is a breathtaking , infections at  steps Italy has just had its third day of slightly lower death tolls than Saturday. That could suggest the increase there is no longer exponential.Evenlockdowns work, there is a better way: South Korea had no lockdown but tested and traced ruthlessly and has low infection rates and deaths.None of these approaches help with immunity. EvenCovid- spread is stopped fullythere is no herd immunity. The non infected are vulnerable to new outbreaks until a vaccine, maybe not before .Last night yet another theory was emerging: that far more people than thought are already infected in the UK and abroad, maybe half the population, but with a far lower percentage of the infected suffering badly than expected.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\" webimg TUFZMTIxNTgOTUw.jpg width w,  webimg TUFZMTIxNTgOTUw.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\"\" fallback\"\" layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Shoppers in a deserted shopping district in Beijing on Sunday.

Please try again later.Submitting...The other less virulent coronaviruses which only cause common colds do not establish high and long lasting immunity and recurrent infections do occur even in adults. Now the strategy has changed to one where we try to defeat the virus by inhibiting its spread. Some argue that we have wasted precious time and that this should have been the strategyfrom the start. It is now absolutely necessary as the NHS could not cope with the very large numbers of patients that would occurthe virus circulated unchecked. About % of the infected people would have to go into hospital of a quarter would end up in intensive care units. Under these conditionsthe epidemic would almost certainly cost over , lives in the UK and about  deaths in Norther Ireland primarily in the elderly who also have other conditions. Even with the restrictions in place an adhered to, serious NHS capacity and supply problems remain. We should take heart from the successful experience in China where numbers after two months of isolation are now low and appear to manageable. The current low rate of lack of testing needs to be changed rapidly as deciding we don’t test so much anymore because the genie is out of the bottle, leads a situation where we don’t know the basis figures that we need for proper modelling the epidemic. The hope is that now that the peak numbers will be reduced and that by the time the peak of the epidemic has passed we will have some drug treatments to alleviate the symptoms for the most serious cases.Several drugs that have been used for other conditions are being trialled and we can reasonably expect that clinical management of the most severe cases can be helped by alleviating the most serious symptoms using these drugs. The benefit is that as they have been used in people before and we have already got extensive experience of their use.We have the sequence of the genome of the virus and that has helped already in formulating the first vaccine candidates that have already gone into small scale trials. More vaccine candidates will follow shortly but it takes time to develop a vaccine that is safe.A demonstrably safe and approved vaccine is probably more than a year away, because one that is to control for an illness that for most people is very minor needs to have been safety tested extensively so that the potential side effects are not worse than the disease. Experience with vaccines for the more serious SARS virus that occurred in  and the MERS virus which circulates in Saudi Arabia with % mortality has shown that eliciting an appropriate long lasting immune response is dficult and that potential vaccine induced disease enhancing effects need to be guarded against. This is why for Covid- a potential vaccine requires much more and extensive testing than say an Ebola vaccine where the diseases is so severe and the mortality is so high that the risk benefit balance for taking the vaccine is skewed to taking it without large scale studies.• Bert Rima is emeritus professor of molecular biology and virology at Queen’s University, Belfast"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/9848897.jpg","title":"news","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now Residents’ concerns over anti-social bikers on Sully sports fields  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Get the Morning Briefing newsletterView all newslettersPromoted Stories       Most popularCommentedLoading...Read more Contact UsNewslettersPhoto SalesNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It will cut planned capital spending to pound million from a budget of pound million and will work to grow online.MS said in a statement: \"Whilst we remain confident that the post-crisis future of the business and our transformation programme remains as strong as ever, trading over the next nine to  months in our clothing and home and international businesses is likely to be severely impacted.\"As a result, it is not possible to provide meaningful guidance on future earnings, although we are taking every step to secure future value for shareholders, colleagues and suppliers.\"The chairman of Wetherspoon has said that a decline in sales was accelerated when prime minister Boris Johnson told people to stay away from pubs.After rising in previous weeks, sales fell by . per cent in the week to March  and the slowdown has picked up further since the Prime Ministers statement, Tim Martin said.It came as the business reported profit before tax rose  per cent to pound. million in the half-year to January  on revenue of pound million.Health secretary Matt Hancock has warned that coronavirus will keep spreading as long as people continue to socialise.Speaking on talkRadio, Mr Hancock said: \"If you stay at home you are saving lives.\"I know, of course, this is a more dangerous disease for older people but not exclusively, some young people get it too.\"But, more importantly, the more that people continue to go out and continue to socialise, the more it will spread and the longer were going to have to keep these measures in place.\"So, were urging people to follow the public health advice.In the emergency Bill thats in front of Parliament right now, we are taking the powers to be able to enforce these measures, so we can make it happen by lawwe need to.\"Id rather not do that and the evidence so far is that the vast majority of people are following the advice, are doing what is sensible and right.\"The company said it was cancelling its interim idend, which had been p a year earlier.Mr Martin said: \"It is obviously very dficult to predict, in these circumstances, how events will unfold in future weeks and months, but we now anticipate profits being below market expectations, so long as the current health scare continues.\"As a result of this uncertainty, it is impossible to provide realistic guidance on our performance in the remainder of the financial year.\"The company has decided to delay most capital projects and to reduce expenditure, where possible, including the cancellation of the interim idend.\"As a result of these actions, combined with the Governments proposals on business rates relief and credit guarantee facilities, the company believes it has sufficient liquidity to maintain operations at a substantially lower level of sales.\"Nicola Sturgeon has urged anyone who left the medical profession in the past three years to consider ing to help the fight against coronavirus.Sharing a plea from Scotlands chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen, the First minister tweeted: \"Scotlands NHS needs our help to meet the #coronavirus challenge.\"Mr Hancock said some retired medics whoto work in the NHS to fight the coronavirus will be able to come \"straight back in\".Asked on the BBCs Breakfast programme when workers couldto the NHS, he said: \"Well, over the next couple of weeks because for some theyll have very recently left and they can come straight back in, their annual trainings been up-to-date and they can just restart.\"Imagineyouve left at Christmas, for instance, you can restart straight away.

The training will happen for those who need it over the next couple of weeks, at the same time well allocate people to a hospital near them because theres a logistical exercise here as well.\"Mr Hancock suggested that tougher measures could have to be brought inpeople do not follow the Governments advice.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"What I can say is thatpeople follow the advice, stay home which saves lives andthey keep apart from others, more than two metres, more than six foot, then we can tackle this and we can turn the tide.\"The scientists advise that we can turn the tide in  weekspeople follow the advice.\"If people dont follow the advice, then itll be longer and we might have to bring more and tougher measures.\"He added: \"We have brought these measures in earlier than Italy did in terms of where theyre up to with the number of cases.\"But were absolutely clear thatwe need to, we have the powers, in fact weve got a Bill in front of Parliament now to strengthen those powers further.\"But I think its far betterpeople follow the advice.\"The FTSE  has risen by more than five per cent in early trading as travel companies jump out ahead after a bruising few weeks for the sector sparked by the Covid- pandemic.Intercontinental Hotels jumped by about a fth despite revealing that demand for rooms was the worst it had ever seen, as markets opened on Friday.EasyJet also rose by around  per cent and cruise operator Carnival jumped by around . per cent.Meanwhile, the price of a barrel of Brent crude oil joined the rally, rising five per cent to . dollarsafter a massive fall earlier in the week.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has warned about the prospect of a recessionpeople do not receive their wages.Labour has urged the Government to ensure the salaries of workers are protected as businesses lose trade during the coronavirus pandemic.He told the BBCs Breakfast programme: \"We need the Government now to act to protect people to keep them in their jobs.\"In that way, what well be able to do is ensure people have an income coming in, their job will be protected, but we prevent the second wave of a recession hitting uswere not careful.\"Becausepeople lose their jobs, they dont have their wages, demand collapses in the economy and then you really do have a recession.\"The lesson from past crises like these is act fast and act big, so thats why were saying the Government should step in and say to employers, well cover  per cent of your wages, you keep people in work.\"Demand for a room at Intercontinental Hotels has reached its lowest point in history, the group said, as the travel industry continues to be battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The business revealed that it would be cutting costs, eliminating its idend and reducing salaries in a bid to save cash.However, shares in the group, which have been badly hit in recent months, jumped by around  per cent on market open in London as investors reacted positively to the companys proposals.Chief executive Keith Barr said: \"Demand for hotels is currently at the lowest levels weve ever seen.Intercontinental Hotel Group has a robust business model and the measures we are announcing today to reduce costs and preserve cash give us the capacity to manage the business through this unique environment and to support our owners during this incredibly dficult time.\"These were not easy choices and we are mindful of the impact these decisions will have on our colleagues and shareholders.\"However, we believe that these are essential to ensuring that we come out of this as strong as we possibly can and ready to capitalise on what remains an industry with excellent long-term growth potential.\"Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said the list of key workers to whom schools will remain open is \"perhaps more extensive than we might have expected\".He said: \"Realistically, theywill need to identy these children by lunchtime.\"Mr Barton added: \"We already know from the trajectory of this that were not going to have many staff.\"We have to be careful that the message to parents is not business as usual.\"Matt Hancock said that a communication will be sent to around . million people who are classed as vulnerable to set out specic action for them to take.The Health secretary told Sky News: \"The first thing were going to do is set out exactly what conditions that applies to.\"We expect about . million people to then get a communication from the NHS to say that they are part of this and what they need to do.\"Many of these people have pre-existing health conditions and so will be very worried right now, and I understand that, and theyll need very specic sets of action - for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice. We will continue to work with the Government throughout the day to provide greater clarity to schools to enable this reduced offer to be up and running as soon as possible.\"Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added her voice to calls from school leaders urging parents to only send their children in as a last resort.She said: \"This is a very long list and could result in some schools having the majority of pupils attending. This will not achieve the goal of slowing the spread of the virus.\"So it is vitally important that parents follow government advice to keep their children at home, wherever possible. Schools can only accommodate a limited number of children and the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread.\"The competition watchdog has launched a taskforce to tackle businesses looking to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to take advantage of customers.The Competition and Markets Authoritysaid the outbreak has prompted concerns that people could be exploited by companies \"charging excessive prices or making misleading claims about their products\".It said it has already contacted traders and s over excessive pricing of hand sanitiser as part of its efforts.Andrea Coscelli, the CMAs chief executive, said: \"This is obviously a time when we all have to behave responsibly to protect our fellow citizens, and particularly those who are most vulnerable.\"We urge retailers to behave responsibly in the exceptional circumstances of the Covid- outbreak.\"Butthey do not, our taskforce is monitoring market developments to enable us to intervene as quickly as possible.\"We have a range of options at our disposal, from warnings to enforcement action to seeking emergency powers.\"The ceremonial of the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace, St Jamess Palace and Windsor Castle is being postponed until further notice \"in line with Government advice to avoid mass gatherings\", Buckingham Palace has announced.The palace said in a statement that the situation would be \"reviewed on an ongoing basis, with a view to restarting when appropriate\". article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The beach huts will also now close with those awarded this yearrsquos annual permits advised that their allocations will now be put on hold. Signs will be put in place and regular announcements made over the public address system to inform people of the situation.Penarth Pier is also to close along with all slipways and public toilets in the Vale.Councillor Neil Moore, Leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoI take no pleasure in imposing such extreme measures, but unfortunately they are absolutely necessary at this critical time. \"Everyone has a responsibility to do all they can to prevent the spread of Coronavirus and that means staying indoors as much as possible and avoiding contact with others.ldquoDespite the UK Governmentrsquos advice to avoid large social gatherings, Barry Island and other locations in the Vale saw a large number of visitors over the weekend. Such behaviour is grossly irresponsible and risks making an already serious situation even worse. That is why I felt we had to take action.ldquoIn the strongest possible terms, I would urge everyone to follow expert advice and only go outsideabsolutely necessary, for essentials such as food, medical supplies or a brief period of exercise. Even then, it is important to practice social distancing and stay at least two metres away from others.\"This should be accompanied by regular hand washing. It is vitally important that each inidual takes the current threat seriously and strictly observes this guidance as not doing so could cost lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Moy Park says many of these positions could be particularly suitable to those from within the hospitality industry due to an existing awareness and familiarity with food hygiene.Moy Park HR and Performance Director, Kirsty Wilkins said “There has been a noticeable increase in grocery sales as people practice social distancing and self-isolate. This has resulted in a heightened demand for chicken produce and with it, opportunities in the sector to meet this demand. We are committed to ensuring we provide nutritious food for our communities, and we are keen to support iniduals who are looking for short term employment to meet changing consumer purchasing habits.“This increase in grocery retail comes at a time when there has been a fall in demand across our sister sectors of hospitality and tourism as people’s socialising and travel plans are curtailed. We hope the pressure being faced across these industries is short term and, in the meantime, we are keen to help anyone looking for a job through these new opportunities.” Kirsty added: “The health and wellbeing of our team is our most important consideration and we are following all relevant government advice and protocols. This includes increased frequency of the sanitising of communal areas and increased availability of Personal Protective Equipmentacross our factories.“Our business is nothing without the people and the farms who supply us. We are thankful to all our team members who are doing a fantastic job. We continue to operate as normal and we have a dedicated team in place which has given careful thought and planning to how we will manage dferent scenarios.”To apply, please email tempjobs@moypark or enquiries@ambitionspersonnel and visit www.ambitionspersonnel\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/258/172/true/1585130106604.jpg--.jpg?1585130106000\\","title":"latest update on coronavirus ","story":"AS of pm on Friday, March , testing has resulted in nine new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to .To date, one person who tested positive has sadly died.The total number of tests completed in Northern Ireland is ,.The Department of Health has advised: People with mild symptoms - new persistent cough and or fever - should stay at home and self-isolate.They will not require testing and will not therefore be included in testing totals.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_cfcabecacb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n n n n n bannerbox_dafbaccec   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1584799583648.jpg--22_more_diagnosed_cases_in_ni.jpg?158479958300","title":" more diagnosed cases in ni ","story":", testing has resulted in  new positive cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland to .
