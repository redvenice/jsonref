Trump has been highly critical of Bezos and the Post\u0027s coverage of the White House. The Bezos affair became public when the Enquirer published a January 9 story about his relationship with Sanchez, a former TV anchor who is also married. Bezos then hired a team of private investigators to find out how the tabloid got the texts and photos the two exchanged.Several days ago, someone at AMI told Bezos\u0027 team that the company\u0027s CEO David Pecker was \u0027apoplectic\u0027 about the investigation, Bezos said.

Pictured is an extract She told MailOnline: \u0027Meghan shows a highly stylised and slow handwriting. She is ultra cautious, is well aware that the world has their eyes on her and that is just how she likes it. \u0027This is not a spontaneous or intellectually creative woman but a consummate performer and strategist.\u0027There is a strong right slant and her letters have often been retraced. There is enormous emotion as well as energy but she is both self aware and self orientated. \u0027However she suffers from anxiety and in this instance her usual regularity and over control of pen strokes does show some wavering and a slight uneven baseline - she is showing some wavering of self control.

It was too dangerous after my heart attacks’          Mr Markle says he only asked for help to move house and that any ‘modest’ financial gifts from Meghan were ‘greatly appreciated’          Her father says: ‘I didn’t stop answering my phone. I was in hospital with a heart attack! Meg and Harry knew what was going on’          Mr Markle comments: ‘I have no idea what this means. This is pure Harry. Americans don’t use the “rabbit hole” expression’          Meghan complains Thomas sided with her half-sister Samantha in criticising her, but he insists: ‘I never wanted Meg to suffer.’Trussell also highlighted the embellishments in Meghan\u0027s handwriting, including the strokes that sweep across the tops of words. She said: \u0027They look like little protective umbrellas, giving further credence to her deep feelings on the matter. \u0027They also reveal her vulnerability - the chink in her armour. Surely this is enough proof how much Meghan cares? It must be exhausting for her!\u0027In the letter Meghan admonishes her father, in anguished tones, for siding with her half-sister Samantha – who has attacked her in the press – while she ‘silently suffered at the hand of her vicious lies’.She goes on to complain that Mr Markle has made no attempt to contact her – and chastises him for falsely telling journalists he is the one who has been shunned – a criticism her father vehemently refutes.She also accuses her father of snubbing her and Prince Harry’s offers to help when he pulled out of attending their wedding following two heart attacks and accuses him of being ungrateful for money she has given him.The former award-winning Hollywood lighting director, who now lives in Mexico, said that he never intended to make the handwritten missive public ‘out of respect for Meghan’ – but says he has been forced to do so now because its contents have been falsely portrayed.Contrary to claims made by the Duchess’s friends, he said the letter made no attempt to heal their bitter rift. ‘I thought it would be an olive branch. Instead, it was a dagger to the heart,’ Mr Markle, 74, said last night.He dismissed suggestions he has made no attempt to patch things up since her wedding. He showed this newspaper texts which he says prove he reached out multiple times to his daughter and the son-in-law he has never met.The US magazine People claimed to ‘put the record straight’ over the Duchess’s relationship with her father and criticism of her style as a Royal.It was based on interviews with five friends – at least one of whom is thought to be one of the Duchess’s co-stars in Suits, the legal drama in which she starred for six years.The Duchess came under fire over her apparent decision to allow her confidantes to defend her in the extraordinary interview, without, it is understood, involving Kensington Palace.The palace has refused to comment on whether the magazine’s anonymous sources had co-operated at the direct request of the Duchess or with her tacit approval.          Thomas Markle says: ‘I’ve never attacked Harry. I asked him to man up’          He insists the Duchess is mistaken: ‘I have only ever spoken out in response to fake narratives and lies’          The Duchess refers to the MoS paparazzi photos story, right, but he insists he continued to reach out          In her letter to her father, the Duchess begged him to stop attacker \u0027patient, kind and understanding\u0027 Prince HarryFormer Buckingham Palace press secretary Dickie Arbiter, who worked for both Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, feared the decision would only exacerbate issues.He said: ‘Assuming – and as these sources are anonymous we don’t know for sure – that this was done with her agreement, it has opened a Pandora’s box. The issue with her father is an open wound and I’m not entirely sure it is the best idea to aggravate that.’Last night, Mr Markle said it was unfair for his daughter’s friends to use the media to ‘spin a line’ while he was being criticised for ‘giving a handful’ of interviews to the press. In the article last Wednesday, the Duchess’s friends said that she was devastated by his response to the letter, in which he suggested father and daughter pose for press pictures.One friend said: ‘She feels like “that’s the opposite of what I’m saying. I’m telling you that I don’t want to communicate through the media, and you’re asking me to… Did you hear anything I said?” ’Mr Markle said he had suggested the photo op as a way of showing the world they could be friends again, describing the Duchess’s reading of it as ‘tragic misunderstanding’ he wishes he could put straight. The rift between the Duchess and her father began after The Mail on Sunday revealed, just days before her wedding in May last year, that he had colluded with the paparazzi to stage a series of lucrative photo opportunities.Such was his humiliation that he offered to pull out of attending the Royal Wedding and was later prevented from going after suffering two heart attacks.Since then, he has given a series of damaging interviews in which he has spoken of his dismay at being cast adrift by his daughter and the Royal Family.Emma Bache\u0027s first book, Reading Between The Lines, is published by Quercus on the 30th of August 2018.             Thomas\u0027s Anguished Reply           The Duchess insisted she phoned him, but he had no missed calls          Mr Markle says he never attacked Harry, but feels he should have met him before the wedding          Mr Markle insists his bid to reduce press intrusion was ‘completely misinterpreted’      "},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry seen time Meghans devastating letters","story":"    The Duke of Sussex alongside French Rugby Federation president Bernard Laporte in the Twickenham stands before England\u0027s Six Nations clash against France today             The royal was stood next to Rugby Football Union president Chris Kelly (left) as he sang the National Anthem  with the home crowd   Make like Meghan in a monochrome dress by GivenchyShop the brandThere is no doubt  the Duchess of Sussex has built an impressive fashion portfolio since joining the Royal Family.

At the top end is the whoodle, a wheaten terrier-poodle cross, which can cost £5,000, then the pugapoo, a pug-poodle cross, which can set you back as much as £4,000.A \u0027poo or \u0027doodle can cost between £15 and £45 a month to insure (a Yorkshire terrier costs around £10 a month), totalling up to £540 a year.One of the familyPoodle crosses are often marketed at families. \u0027They\u0027re intelligent, boisterous and tend to have good temperaments, making them easy to train,\u0027 explains Marc Abraham of charity Pup Aid, which aims to combat puppy farming.Poodles are said to be the second-most intelligent dog, after border collies, while the typical mix breeds are affectionate (Maltese), sociable (Labradors) and playful (Schnauzers).The belief that they\u0027re non-shedding is a myth. \u0027A 100 per cent poodle will not shed as much as many other breeds, but as soon as you cross it with another breed you lose that advantage — possibly totally,\u0027 explains Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine.          Jane Blake, 56, a retired teacher from Surrey with her dog Daisy. The pooch is a cross between a toy poodle and a goldendoodleGenetic timebombMany believe crossbreeding eliminates genetic defects, but experts are doubtful. \u0027Take a Labrador with hip problems and cross it with a poodle with bad eyesight, and you\u0027ll end up with a labradoodle that can\u0027t walk properly and can\u0027t see,\u0027 says Marc Abraham, who regularly sees poodle crosses at his Brighton surgery.Barb Turnbull of the Doodle Trust says another problem occurs when breeders mate miniature or toy poodles with larger breeds. \u0027There is no shortcut to miniaturising a breed,\u0027 she adds. \u0027Crossing a large breed with a small breed creates skeletal problems and the resulting puppies will probably end up crippled.\u0027Other issues include dogs with brains too big for their skulls, and large puppies which have to be born by Caesarean.

The idea is they could be used in cases such as humanitarian disaster or hostage rescues.He said: \u0027These globally deployable, multi-role vessels would be able to conduct a wide range of operations from crisis support to war fighting.\u0027They would support our future Commando force, our world-renowned Royal Marines - they will be forward deployed at exceptionally high readiness and able to respond at a moment\u0027s notice - bringing the fight from the sea to land.\u0027He said the two ships - one of the first investments from the Transformation Fund - could be based to the east of Suez in the Indo-Pacific and to the west of Suez in the Mediterranean, Atlantic and Baltic.It is understood the Ministry of Defence (MoD) is considering using cargo ships or ferries, with the existing hulls converted and ultimately able to deploy assets from them including fast boats, landing craft, helicopters and special forces.Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson \u0027lands taxpayers with a...\u0027She was shocked when we entered\u0027: Jeremy Corbyn drove two...Share this articleThey could be used in hostage rescue situations, humanitarian disasters, intelligence surveillance and could intervene in situations in an agile way, the Press Association understands.The vessels may be bought outright or leased, with the adaption carried out by British companies.The cost is believed to be into the tens of millions. Labour MP Martin Whitfield, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign, said: \u0027The Defence Secretary can\u0027t help but embarrass himself. This is the safety of our country we\u0027re talking about, not overselling the credentials of a fireplace.\u0027Brexit Britain means a secondhand navy made up of old ferry ships. It\u0027s not going to scare Russia and it\u0027s not going to see us rule the waves once more.\u0027If we want the world to turn to us for leadership, then we should be leading - not running away from our responsibilities in the EU.\u0027           The diminished strength of Britain\u0027s famed Royal Navy can be seen in comparison to the rest of the top world powersMr Williamson also announced plans to \u0027develop swarm squadrons of network-enabled drones capable of confusing the enemy and overwhelming their air defences\u0027. The devices could be deployed as soon as the end of this year, Mr Williamson claimed.  Mr Williamson claimed actions by China and Russia have blurred the boundaries between peace and war.Warning \u0027state-on-state competition was reviving\u0027 Mr Williamson said: \u0027Russia is resurgent - rebuilding its military arsenal to bring the independent countries of the former Soviet Union like Georgia and Ukraine back into its orbit.\u0027All the while China is developing its modern capability and commercial power.\u0027 The tone of his speech is likely to frustrate Whitehall officials who have urged ministers to play down Russia\u0027s strength and not encourage Moscow\u0027s propaganda machine.He added: \u0027We have to be ready to show the high price of aggressive behaviour,\u0027 Mr Williamson said.\u0027To talk but fail to act risks our nation being seen as little more than a paper tiger. Against adversaries upping their spending and advancing technology, we have to respond.\u0027If we do not, we will find ourselves with fewer options when we face threats in the future. \u0027As uncertainty grows we must be ready to act and bring others with us.

The horse in question was fully vaccinated, as are all the horses that are stabled on our site.\u0027We immediately quarantined all horses on our site and communicated with all owners. All horses will be monitored daily. There is no risk to humans and strict biosecurity measures are in place.\u0027          The British Horseracing Authority has announced four cases found at the Newmarket yardIn the latest update this afternoon, the BHA said no decision on racing resuming should be expected \u0027before 10.30pm at the earliest\u0027, which will allow the industry veterinary committee - which includes representation from the  Animal Health Trust (AHT) and independent expertise - \u0027to have access to the most recent evidence\u0027.A statement read: \u0027Analysis is ongoing at the AHT, in line with a prioritisation plan based on the potential exposure of horses to a horse that has tested positive (for example at the fixture at Ayr on February 6), or to a horse from a yard returning a positive test.\u0027Swabs will continue to be collected and tested from other horses, but some have been fast-tracked to help inform this evening\u0027s decision making process.\u0027Separately, a specific plan is being formed as to what the clearance process will be for inidual yards to return to racing. The details of this plan will be confirmed as part of the decision making process for any return to racing.          The BHA said Crisford (whose stables are pictured today )had been named \u0027in order to ensure the Newmarket community is aware of the yard at which an infection has been identified\u0027\u0027Should the decision be taken to return to racing on Wednesday, declarations for any fixtures staged will be at 10am on Tuesday. \u0027The BHA would provide further updates regarding the declaration process for any fixtures staged on Thursday and beyond.\u0027The news of the further cases comes after what had appeared to be a positive weekend in the fight against the disease, with no fresh cases being reported either on Saturday or up to a previous BHA statement issued at about 4.30pm yesterday.Some 720 tests had returned negative on Saturday and around the same total was estimated in addition to that on Sunday, from over 2,000 received by the AHT in Newmarket.

A general view of the London headquarters of the British Horseracing Authority, last Friday\u0027However, the picture is still developing and it remains the case that we will make an evidence-based decision about the situation on Monday.\u0027It remains paramount that, for the sake of our horse population, we do not take any unnecessary risks. This is not a common cold, it is a highly contagious and potentially serious disease.\u0027Mr Sykes went on: \u0027The prioritisation exercise with regards to testing will help deliver a detailed picture of the spread of infection.\u0027Targeted testing, alongside the wide survey of data we have already gathered, will help provide a clear picture as to the scale of the spread of the disease.\u0027Any decision will include guidance and input from veterinary experts, including the industry\u0027s veterinary committee.\u0027We are also working through the process that will be followed in order to give specific yards the all clear to resume racing.          James Tate, trainer and vet surgeon Newmarket-based trainer and veterinary surgeon James Tate admits the discovery of four cases of equine influenza in the town is a significant blow to the chances of racing resuming later this week.He told Sky Sports Racing: \u0027Basically this is another trace that will need to be followed and another line of investigation.\u0027Yesterday we were all hoping that while poor Donald McCain\u0027s yard was on lockdown, the rest of us might be able to get back going.\u0027Now it\u0027s Donald McCain\u0027s yard and Simon Crisford\u0027s yard on lockdown and we have to trace the Simon Crisford line of infection before we can let everybody else keep going.\u0027And then, God forbid, we get any other positives in other yards.\u0027 Mr Tate added: \u0027The virus can be transferred through the air - although only a certain amount of metres - and between staff and between horses passing in strings.\u0027If Simon Crisford\u0027s horses have just tested positive, none of them were infectious during the early part of last week and certainly in the latter part of last week he was exercising on the Heath in the afternoons with other at-risk horses.\u0027It is concerning and we just have to hope it hasn\u0027t transferred to any other yards. The long and the short of it is we were hoping to get back racing towards the end of this week and this is a setback and now that looks unlikely.\u0027                                                     \u0027We are liaising with the National Trainers Federation and trainers on this process.\u0027Mr Crisford enjoyed a successful season in 2018, and has high hopes of Classic success in the new campaign with the once-beaten colt Jash, owned by Sheikh Hamdan and prominent in the betting for the Qipco 2000 Guineas.He also enjoyed victory at Royal Ascot in June, winning the Britannia Handicap with Ostilio.The BHA had said in the afternoon statement that \u0027a pragmatic and evidence-led approach\u0027 was being adopted in order to make a decision if racing can swing back into action as hoped on Wednesday, with a prioritisation plan for testing in place.It said that plan places emphasis on the \u0027the proximity of horses to a positive test, or to a yard returning a positive test\u0027 with swabs continuing to be collected and tested, with some being \u0027fast tracked\u0027.The BHA also said \u0027a specific plan is being formed as to what the clearance process will be for inidual yards to return to racing\u0027.The BHA also confirmed all horses from the stable of Rebecca Menzies have now tested negative, although the yard remains under under close surveillance.Former champion jumps trainer Martin Pipe feels racing is unlikely to resume in Britain on WednesdayHe told BBC Radio 5 Live\u0027s Sportsweek: \u0027I think it might be difficult for Wednesday, it might be doubtful, it depends how they progress on the tests.\u0027I\u0027m hopeful it might be on by the end of the week, but that\u0027s hope more than anything. Of course, Cheltenham is coming up, a very important meeting. \u0027We all hope it will be contained by then of course, but there\u0027s lots of racing and planning to be done before Cheltenham.\u0027The welfare of the horses is most important, that\u0027s certainly got to come first.

There was damage to the paintwork.\u0027In mitigation defence lawyer Robert Stewart: \u0027It is always an unfortunate situation when we have a person of Mr Chapman\u0027s age before the courts.

The plan was designed to ease pressure on shipping capacity at nearby Dover if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal next monthA DfT spokeswoman said yesterday: \u0027Following the decision of Seaborne Freight\u0027s backer, Arklow Shipping, to step back from the deal, it became clear Seaborne would not reach its contractual requirements with the Government. We have therefore decided to terminate our agreement.\u0027The Government is already in advanced talks with a number of companies to secure additional freight capacity, including through the port of Ramsgate, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\u0027 Mr Grayling last month defended the Seaborne Freight contract, insisting it was \u0027not a risk\u0027.It was one of three firms awarded contracts totalling £108million in late December to lay on additional crossings to ease the pressure on Dover when Britain leaves the EU, despite having never run a Channel service.The department said it had been Arklow Shipping\u0027s backing that gave it confidence in the viability of the deal, and that it stands by the robust due diligence carried out on Seaborne Freight.It added no taxpayer money had been transferred to the company.Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said: \u0027The whole exercise is a complete and utter shambles, with the Government ignoring union calls on what needs to happen.\u0027Instead they are blundering on from crisis to crisis.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Christian Louboutin wins landmark victory copycat shoes","story":"    Christian Louboutin won a seven-year disputeLuxury footwear designer Christian Louboutin has won a landmark victory over claims a rival was ripping off its distinctive red-soled shoes.Following a seven-year dispute, Dutch shoemaker Van Haren has been ordered to stop selling copycat versions of the upmarket high heels.Louboutin has been locked in a legal battle with Van Haren since 2012 after discovering the retailer was selling high-heeled shoes with red soles.The shade used by Louboutin is trademarked in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.Last year Van Haren argued that the trademark is invalid because EU law does not allow shapes in trademarks - like shoe soles.But Louboutin has now won the case, meaning that it will be the only company in the region awarded the trademark to make and sell the signature shoes, which go for up to £1,965 online.Van Haren has been ordered by a Hague court to destroy all existing copies of its footwear, which was designed as part of a collection with actress Halle Berry, and provide details of outlets in which they were sold.French designer Louboutin, 55, opened his first shop in 1991 with Princess Caroline of Monaco as his first customer.Make America Mate Again: Meet the unapologetic founder of...Diary of a \u0027Mercedes Mum\u0027: Instagram-famous mother, 27,...Share this article    Louboutin, 55, opened his first shop in 1991 with Princess Caroline of Monaco as his first customerHe came up with the idea for the red-soled heels after reaching for an assistant\u0027s \u0027Chinese Red\u0027 nail polish to add the finishing touches to a pair of high heels.Most famous for his stiletto heels, Louboutin\u0027s shoes have been worn by celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow, Madonna, Jennifer Lopez and Tina Turner.The heels also featured prominently on Sex in the City, worn by the television show\u0027s main character Carried Bradshaw played by Sarah Jessica Parker.A spokesman for Christian Louboutin said: \u0027Christian Louboutin warmly welcomes this new judgement, which further strengthens the favourable decisions regarding the validity of the red sole trademark already issued in many countries.\u0027 Louboutin has faced a series of legal battles over the distinctive soles in recent years.A Paris appeals court in May ordered the French shoe firm Kesslord to pay Louboutin damages after it sold similar red-soled shoes.In 2012 a US court also said that Louboutin could trademark the red soles, reversing an earlier ruling that would have allowed rival Yves Saint Laurent to paint its outsoles scarlet.But one year before that Louboutin lost a separate case in France against the Spanish clothing chain Zara."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e97e9de68b2382a460cac3f1f90b097036809f3/124_76_3155_1893/master/3155.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=336ffdd41feee13cc6edf3be643b8432","title":"afghanistans generation z a photo essay","story":"Afghanistan’s Generation Z has grown up in a 17-year window overshadowed by war and a heavy international presence and now faces an uncertain future and the possibility of stark changeThe start of 2019 has brought for Afghanistan a tantalising hope of peace, as the Taliban sat down for talks first with Americans in Qatar and with senior members of the Afghan elite in Moscow. Donald Trump has told Americans his administration had accelerated talks for a political settlement in Afghanistan and would be able to reduce US troops there as negotiations advance to end America’s longest war.No one knows what form a new government may take or how much control the Taliban might have under any deal, but for young people who were babies when the Taliban were driven from power by a US-led campaign in 2001, the prospect of peace with the hardline Islamists brings a daunting mix of hope and fear.For villagers in rural Afghanistan, where traditional ways have always counted for more than central government law, life may not change much. But for the young of Kabul and other cities, there is much to lose, in particular the freedoms restored after the Taliban were ousted – from playing music, to modelling and adopting trendy haircuts – which they’ve grown up with.“The thing I’m most worried about is that if they return, I’ll not be able to continue playing music,” said a 16-year-old pianist who attends music school in Kabul.  “It will be great if the government and the Taliban reach a peace deal. At that time there should be access to music for everyone and women’s rights must be protected.”When the Taliban were last in power, they gained global notoriety for a harsh regime that forced women and girls to stay at home, restricted music and sports and imposed brutal punishment on infractions of a hardline version of Islamic law. More recently, they have adopted a more moderate tone, including pledges on rights for women and girls’ education, appeals for support from foreign aid groups and promises to maintain good international relations.While huge doubts remain, the peace talks have given young people a sense of hope.  “I am optimistic about the Taliban joining the peace process,” said Hussain, 19, who like many young Afghans grew up in neighbouring Iran where millions have taken refuge from war. He now works as a hairdresser in Kabul. “It will be an end to the war and conflicts in our country. I want the Taliban to change their policy and not behave like before.”They have also had to deal with near-daily violence and a broken economy that cannot provide jobs for the 400,000 or so new entrants to the workforce every year. Hundreds of thousands have migrated in the years since 2014, when most foreign forces left. Many have risked dangerous journeys in search of new homes in countries such as Turkey, or in Europe or further afield. For some of those who have remained, there is now hope that peace will bring opportunities.Women’s rights have improved in recent years under the western-backed Afghan government, especially in cities such as the capital Kabul, where many women work outside the home and more than a quarter of the parliament is female.The male generational gap may be explained by younger men seeking rigid gender roles as they struggle to find work and stability in a country ravaged by war and poverty, said gender equality group Promundo. Religious teachings against women’s rights under the Taliban regime had also played a role in hardening views among younger men.Sultan Qasim Sayeedi, an 18-year-old model scours Facebook, YouTube and Instagram to learn about fashion and modelling, and draws inspiration from his favourite models, including Saudi Arabia’s Omar Borkan, and Canadian popstar Justin Bieber. “We’re afraid that if the Taliban come then we will not be able to hold our shows,” he said. Despite that wariness, Sultan says it’s time the fighting ended. “If American troops will go peace will come, we want peace,” he said.Maryam Ghulami, a 20-year-old living in the western province of Herat, says her generation will bring change that her parents never could. She is learning graphic design and computer coding at an online academy and likes to hone her skills with YouTube tutorials. While she believes Afghanistan faces many problems – a slow and unreliable internet connection, for a start – she has faith that her generation can bring change. “The new generation can change Afghanistan with knowledge, with technology,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30208d8509f66775a6e3e8193d9fe2005d0f7c7a/511_826_2018_1210/master/2018.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=40134ce05289f956c26ca8eafb2a094f","title":"shelf policing how books and cacti make women too spiky for men","story":"‘To create a new relationship,’ a life coach advises single women to empty their boudoir of distractions such as books – particularly if they’re downbeat“How to avoid turning your home into a MANrepeller”, the Daily Mail proclaimed from atop the mountain on Sunday. “Interiors therapist reveals the items that could be making your abode offputting to men.”It could be forgiven for wanting to jump on the Marie Kondo bandwagon, but the twist obviously had to be that the gaze you must please is not your own, but a man’s.Femail’s nominated manrepeller was a journalist named Liz Hoggard, and her salvation came in the form of life coach Suzanne Roynon, whose mission is to “clear your past and present clutter to create a new relationship in your life”.How does it work in practice? Well, there are a number of rules. You should not have too many paintings of “strong, iconic” but single women in your home cacti are bad because they’re “too spiky”.Bedrooms should be “a boudoir to welcome a man into”, where he feels comfortable and “not squashed out by anything else”. We’d already been told that men can feel threatened by confident women, women earning more than men and women expecting pleasure from sex but “menacing bedside furniture” is a new one.Speaking of bedrooms – books apparently aren’t allowed in there, as they are a room for “sleep and love”. This raises some questions. Does it mean that if you like reading a book in bed you must then go put it back elsewhere in the house just before falling asleep? Is one book (singular) in the bedroom fine but two or more forbidden? What if you do find a partner thanks to your attractive new flat and he also enjoys reading in bed, does this create a loophole? Should you read this singular book together at the same time? Any word on Kindles?Roynon doesn’t expand on these particular quandaries, but does offer more advice on books. As it turns out, a single woman in search of companionship should not own novels with “depressing titles” like Little Deaths or The Suspect.This presumably means that sad or brutal novels with deceptively cheerful titles are AOK. Jonathan Littell’s Holocaust fiction bestseller might have a scene where a soldier bashes the head of a newborn child against a kitchen counter, but it is called The Kindly Ones so on the happy shelf it goes.It is also telling that when it comes to books, we are left with a number of don’ts but no do’s – what we read cannot be in view when we fall asleep and cannot (seem to) be a bummer, but that’s pretty much it.Perhaps we should try to go further. If you are a single woman and would like a man to come to your flat and not run away weeping and screaming, why not let your book collection do the talking for you? Buy 35 copies of Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick and leave them lying around every corner of your house, in places where he will least expect it, so he is constantly reminded of the fact that you’re up for it. It doesn’t matter that the book is about a bit more than that as we’ve established, men only ever look at the covers.Or maybe put Normal People by Sally Rooney in a place where he is sure to spot it. Not only is it a good book, but it will subconsciously tell him that you are, in fact, normal. Just a normal woman, looking for a normal man, so you can be a normal couple together, living in your normal house. Normal, normal, normal. What’s not to love?Actually, scratch that: get rid of all your books. After all, looking for love should be a full-time occupation, and you have a welcoming boudoir you need to get started on. Do consider stuffing your cacti in one of the cushions if endless nonsensical relationship advice catered towards women has taught us anything, it’s that a man likes to be kept on his toes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5f14722c01e93370e517b0b041a68e941a600c7/104_714_6276_3766/master/6276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0852cb337a940f07cbff6986e82eb0b7","title":"debenhams announce 40m short term cash injection","story":"Move aims to buy department store time to arrange long-term finance and shop closure plansDebenhams is expected to announce a short-term cash injection of about £40m as it buys more time to arrange a longer-term refinancing and store closure plan.The ailing department store chain, which has 165 outlets and employs 25,000 people, is battling to reach a deal with its banks and bondholders after a difficult Christmas capped off a lacklustre 2018, during which it issued three profit warnings.Lenders have agreed to extend the company’s overdraft limit in an attempt to give it time to refinance its debts, and an announcement about the extension could come as soon as Tuesday.

Cashflow has been squeezed as suppliers concerned about the financial health of the company are demanding more up-front payments.The retailer has been sounding out property advisory firms about organising the rapid closure of as many as 50 stores via an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).Such a route has already been taken by other struggling high street chains including New Look, Mothercare and Carpetright as the whole industry struggles with a combination of rising costs, falling sales and the switch to internet shopping. CVAs can take several weeks to arrange and it is not clear if a deal can be put in place before Debenhams’ quarterly rent day in late March, when it will have to pay out about £50m to landlords.Before Christmas, Sports Direct offered the department store a £40m loan but the company turned it down because it came with a demand for security over some of Debenhams’ assets that would have given Ashley’s company a preferential position over other shareholders.The credit agency Moody’s cut its view on Debenhams to negative last month, saying the company would struggle to refinance its debts without raising new funds. The company had put on hold plans to raise cash by selling its Danish Magasin du Nord chain after failing to receive strong enough offers. After weak sales and pressure on profit margins over Christmas, Moody’s said it expected Debenhams’ underlying profits to fall by up to £20m this year, having previously predicted they would be similar to last year.Pressure on the company ramped up in January when its then chairman, Sir Ian Cheshire, and chief executive, Sergio Bucher, were ousted from the boardroom by Ashley’s Sports Direct and the Dubai-based retail billionaire Micky Jagtiani’s Milestone Resources, which voted against them at its annual shareholder meeting.Cheshire stepped down immediately and was replaced by the interim chairman, Terry Duddy, the former chief executive of Home Retail Group. Bucher has stayed on but is no longer a director."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ead1d6402c2c9a2f09172b58fdcb7e44dce780a/0_291_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2310d79c97a4ee229f98f394324b22bd","title":"did you work for a uk high street chain that has closed","story":"For an upcoming project, we would like to hear from former workers of chain shops that shut about how it affected their livesWith thousands of high street shops closing over the last decade, communities have been rightly concerned about the decline and what the future holds.If you worked for a high street chain that shut down, we’d like to hear from you.

Seventy years later in New York’s Bronx, young people made the streets their dancefloor as hip-hop boomed at block parties and b-boys tried to outdo each other in acrobatic dance battles.Both of these dance forms, tango and hip-hop, were sparked when people were thrown together in close proximity, often immigrants striving in hard-scrabble lives, looking for fun, escapism and self-expression – – the city’s marginalised residents claiming their space. Dance needs cities. A choreographer cannot work alone. Dance needs people to perform and witness it, so will always thrive where many bodies are gathered en masse. But could cities need dance, too?Ellie Cosgrave, a lecturer in urban innovation at University College London, is looking at how choreographic methods could improve urban engineering. Choreographers and engineers have some key things in common, she says: they both design materials and experiences through time and space.Cosgrave says large engineering institutions are not fit to adapt to the fast-changing social, environmental and technological needs of the 21st century. Cities designed increasingly by computer modelling may not take into account the foibles and feelings of the humans who use them, and the kind of improvisation and live feedback that choreographers employ could provide a new model for creating urban spaces.We’ll have to wait to see the results of Cosgrave’s research, but whether or not choreography could be used to shape the cities of the future, there are myriad ways in which cities have shaped dance: the mass of bodies thrumming through urban hubs has always been a motor and generator for movement.Around the same time hip-hop was taking shape in the Bronx, just 10 miles south in Manhattan the postmodern choreographer Trisha Brown was dancing a graceful semaphore among the chimneys and water tanks of Soho’s rooftops in Roof Piece (1971). In Man Walking Down the Side of a Building (1970) and Woman Walking Down a Ladder (1973), she had her dancers inhabit the vertical space of the high-rise city, horizontal bodies (in harnesses) descending down buildings. Brown turned the city’s streets and walls into her studio, and passersby into spectators.More recently, New York’s streets provided the stage and set for a film adaptation of Jerome Robbins’ NY Export: Opus Jazz, his 1958 “ballet in sneakers”. The work was made just a year after his original production of West Side Story and has the same cool jazz feel. Its restless urban youthfulness still felt fresh and relevant 60 years later as dancers converged in an empty Brooklyn swimming pool and duetted on the (pre-renovation) High Line at sunset.Robbins was assistant artistic director at New York City Ballet, where founder George Balanchine, a Russian emigre, developed a particularly American style of ballet, inspired by the vibrant skyscraper city itself: his dancers taller and thinner, their legs thrown higher, their pace faster, their lines sleeker, all fuelled by the energy and verve of the people and architecture around them.The German choreographer Pina Bausch’s World Cities series was a group of 10 works that ned from 1986 to her death in 2009, each made in, and inspired by, a different city around the world. The works give only tantalising impressions of the places they came from – each work is unmistakably Bauschian, a reminder that wherever we might go, we still take ourselves with us – but they are laced with particular flavours and her idiosyncratic observations.Her vision of Sicily in Palermo Palermo is filled with litter, rubble and an obsession with meat water is everywhere in Wiesenland, inspired by Budapest, city of spas and bathing. And sojourns in sunny Santiago (in the piece Como el Musguito), Lisbon (Masurca Fogo) and Istanbul (Nefés) produced softer, warmer works than the hard and sometimes cruel Teutonic tanztheater she’s known for.Rather than showing us their own impressions, some artists ask viewers to rethink their perspectives on familiar cities. The Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker’s Slow Walk is a mindful flashmob that has taken place in Brussels and Paris (and will be in Bruges on 23 February), where participants walk for several hours at a pace of less than five metres per minute, giving time to pay attention to every movement of their bodies and their relationship with their surroundings.The Austrian artist Willi Dorner’s Bodies in Urban Spaces series takes a more absurdist approach, putting dancers in cities’s forgotten nooks and crannies, piling them up in alcoves or squishing them into gaps between buildings, railings or lamp posts, bringing our attention to architectural shapes and voids and making us look again at things we pass every day.Dorner’s interest is in how design, large and small, limits where and how we can move, something that also appears in the work of Patricia Noxolo, a lecturer in human geography, when she talks about place ballet, a concept originated by David Seamon to describe how the movements and trajectories of people moving in a public space – at a market, for example – unknowingly create a large-scale choreography.Noxolo also uses the term to refer to our inidual movement signatures: how our surroundings mould the ways we move our bodies and embed physical habits, our own “place ballets”. Growing up in a concrete maisonette in Birmingham’s Lee Bank, her movement repertoire was forged by navigating narrow walkways, leaning over balconies, running down stairs and pounding hard pavements.There is no doubt the design of cities influences how we move, from high-concept choreography to the literally pedestrian. Now it seems, in the light of Cosgrave’s research, that choreographers could be able to help create cities, too.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, explore our archive or sign up to receive our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8f64e4ac4cfae80cae371c5306bf4f0fb172966/0_265_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d1bae690c31858b79d9cd7091e3c6c0","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of afternoon","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘afternoon’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘afternoon’.Share your photos of what afternoon means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 13 February at 10am.

Such steep subsidies would not be sustainable but cost reductions in the industry have seen that figure drop to as low as £57.50. The offshore wind industry has previously been criticised for not using enough UK contractors and suppliers.What is the economic benefit to the UK?The industry employs around 11,000 people. One of the side effects of offshore wind’s growth has been an injection of money and jobs into coastal towns that in some cases have big pockets of economic deprivation. Ports have been upgraded and new maintenance facilities built, such as the one at Newhaven in East Sussex for the first windfarm in the English Channel. The different parts of turbines are made across the UK, from the Isle of Wight to Hull.What does the future hold for offshore wind power in the UK?The industry has a target of growing today’s 8GW capacity to 30GW by 2030, which, if achieved, would see offshore wind power supplying more than a third of the UK’s electricity. The government has put a £557m pot of funding aside for subsidies for renewables in the next few years, most of which is expected to be taken up by offshore windfarms. The industry is also hoping for export opportunities for UK firms, as new markets grow in the US and Asia.The size of the project takes the burgeoning offshore wind power sector to a new scale, on a par with conventional fossil fuel-fired power stations.Hornsea One will cover 407 sq km, five times the size of the nearby city of Hull. At 1.2GW of capacity it will power 1m homes, making it about twice as powerful as today’s biggest offshore windfarm once it is completed in the second half of this year.“The ability to generate clean electricity offshore at this scale is a globally significant milestone at a time when urgent action needs to be taken to tackle climate change,” said Matthew Wright, UK managing director of Ørsted, the world’s biggest offshore windfarm builder.The power station is only the first of four planned in the area, with a green light and subsidies already awarded to a second stage due for completion in the early 2020s.The first two phases will use 7MW turbines, which are taller than London’s Gherkin building.But the latter stages of the Hornsea development could use even more powerful, 10MW-plus turbines. Bigger turbines will capture more of the energy from the wind and should lower costs by reducing the number of foundations and amount of cabling firms need to put into the water.Henrik Poulsen, Ørsted’s chief executive, said he was in close dialogue with major manufacturers to use the new generation of turbines, some of which are expected to approach the height of the Shard in London, the tallest building in the EU.Offshore windfarms could help ministers fill the low carbon power gap created by Hitachi and Toshiba scrapping nuclear plants, the executive suggested. “If nuclear should play less of a role than expected, I believe offshore wind can step up,” he said.The turbines for Hornsea One are built and shipped from Siemens Gamesa’s factory in Hull, part of a web of UK-based suppliers that has sprung up around the growing sector.Around half of the project’s transition pieces, the yellow part of the structure that connects the foundation to the tower, are made in Teeside. Many of the towers themselves are made by a firm in Campbeltown in the Scottish highlands. Altogether, about half of the components for the project are made in the UK.Ørsted is not yet ready to bid for a share of a £60m pot of further offshore windfarm subsidies, to be auctioned by the government this summer, but expects the price to reach even more competitive levels than those seen in 2017.Like other international energy companies, Ørsted has put in place contingency planning in event of a no-deal Brexit – but the hope is that will not come to pass. “We want a Brexit deal that will facilitate an orderly transition out of the union,” said Poulsen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/786d9ec4ed54e929f5ed14d828db55a1f629c16f/0_177_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d33d853edc535187231297e627ebfa81","title":"gully boy review berlin film festival","story":"This drama about a likable lad from Mumbai who dreams of hip-hop stardom teeters cheerfully on the edge of campThere is storytelling gusto and fun in this Mumbai-set romantic drama teetering cheerfully on the edge of camp, about a young guy called Murad who dreams of being a hip-hop megastar. He lives in the tough slum district of Dharavi with his extended family, who all work hard to make ends meet and take cash from insensitive, selfie-stick-brandishing British and American tourists trooping through their front room on “poverty tours” of the district.Murad, played by Ranveer Singh, is listlessly taking a business studies course, and coming home every night to the overcrowded family apartment, into which his dad (Vijay Raaz) has brought a second wife, creating all sorts of unease. The rest of the time, Murad hangs out with his friends, smoking weed and getting involved in petty crime. He nervously tags along when his dealer pal steals a car, almost out of pure boredom. The rest of the time he earnestly writes rap lyrics in his notebook, in time-honoured 8 Mile style.Murad has long had a semi-secret romantic understanding with Safeena (Alia Bhatt), his childhood sweetheart, who wears the hijab and is the apple of her respectable father’s eye. Their relationship is a secret, we assume, because he is from the wrong side of the tracks. But Murad is a little afraid of Safeena because, despite her demure image, she has flashes of violent jealousy. Murad’s life is changed when he meets Sher (Siddhant Chaturvedi) a local hip-hop star, who introduces him to the world of rap battles, and also to Sky (Kalki Koechlin), a wealthy and glamorous white woman with music industry connections. Soon Murad is reborn with the new rapper name “Gully Boy”. But will he just forget about his old friends, and maybe break Safeena’s heart?The set piece and high point of the film is the uproarious video that Murad makes on the tough streets of Dharavi itself, which naturally goes viral and makes him a star – and as we see it being made with establishing shots of the camera crew and the dolly tracks, etc, it is just about plausible, and very enjoyable.Murad himself is likable precisely because he does not fit the template of the macho, misogynist rapper: he is diffident, hardworking, with a style in personal grooming that could almost be called metrosexual. When his dad is injured at work, and Murad must temporarily take over his job as a chauffeur, ferrying spoilt young women all over town, he does so with a kind of martyred dignity, reflecting on the injustices of class and squirrelling away his observations in his rap notebook.In the end, Gully Boy runs on very traditional lines, and maybe comes too close to cliche, but is always engagingly dead set on entertainment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d85e674404e9eb32fd6676b55f4af47752165f0/0_93_2768_1661/master/2768.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa8d28b1cfd345f7ad3334182994127","title":"malcolm mcdowell mike figgis on hero albert finney","story":"Spying on Michael Douglas, telling Nic Cage how to play drunk, pretending he was gay to Audrey Hepburn … two giants of cinema remember their hero Albert FinneyThe first time I met Albert, he shook my hand and said: “You have a very interesting face,” in that famous Northern lilt of his. I’ll never forget it as long as I live. It was in 1968, on the set of Lindsay Anderson’s If…, which Albert produced and which was my breakthrough. I didn’t tell him then but he was my hero: when I saw him in Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, as a young man in Liverpool, it made me realise that I could could be an actor, too.During that period British films were mainly bourgeois middle-class, middle-of-the-road comedies where you sat on the sofa with a cup of tea. Albert was the most influential actor of his generation because he made it possible for actors from the provinces to make it – indeed, he made it good to be working class.There had been no leading man before like him: he epitomised what John Osborne was writing about in Look Back in Anger: this “fuck you” attitude to the establishment – which we loved and needed. If you came from the provinces at that time, it was very intimidating to try and make it in London. In music, the path had been softened by the Beatles, but in film and theatre it was still very hard. Albert made it possible – along with his contemporaries, like Tom Courtenay and Alan Bates.But for me at least, he was the great shining light. He had this mix of boyish northern charm and, just below the surface, a wild, unpredictable danger – devilment, even – which audiences really responded to. You never quite knew what he was going to do next.He wasn’t really like that in person. He loved his great food and great wines. I remember a four-hour boozy lunch with him in Soho with my dear sister, Gloria, and his then-girlfriend, Pene. It was wonderful. And then he would go off to a fat farm to get ready for the next movie.A lot of the best stories about Albert are not repeatable. He was irresistible to beautiful women – which he loved. And he was mischievous. It’s not a very politically-correct story, but I remember him telling me about the time the director Stanley Donen introduced him to Audrey Hepburn. They were to star together in this Hollywood romance, Two For the Road, and had dinner in a bistro in Chelsea. And Albert played it completely limp-wristed, lisping and gay. Audrey was absolutely horrified. When Albert excused himself at the end of the meal, she turned to Stanley and said: “What are you doing? This has to be a great love affair!” and he went: “Oh, he’s just joking.” Then Albert came back with that great big grin on his face and Audrey said: “You bastard!” That was Albert.He was also a very private man – he never courted the press. He wasn’t egotistical: I remember going to see him at the National when he played Don Pedro in Much Ado About Nothing. He didn’t always need to take the leading role – though, of course, you couldn’t take your eyes off him. He was an authentic, great talent. That’s important – and rare.I hope in some sense he passed a baton to me, with If… and then with O Lucky Man!, just as Gary Oldman once told me it was seeing those films which made him want to be an actor. I feel very indebted and close to Albert still. I’ll miss him very much. • As told to Catherine ShoardIt was day one on the shoot of The Browning Version in 1994. Albert was sitting with the script, using a thick black marker pen to cross out sections of text. I asked him if he was making dialogue changes. “No, I’m just crossing out all those directions that say, ‘He looks up sadly’, or ‘He holds back the emotion.’ I’ll make those decisions myself when I do the scene.”In the film, Albert’s character has to deal with a series of humiliations – we were filming one such scene. In my script (by the great writer Ronald Harwood) it did suggest a tearful face. We’d done a couple of takes and Albert’s face was noticeably dry. I asked if we should perhaps do one with moisture. Albert was never rude or high-handed. He just opened his script and pointed out that 10 pages later comes the big scene where he finally breaks down. I apologised and we quickly moved on to the next scene.I met Albert when I was trying to raise money for my first film, Stormy Monday. He’d always been my favourite British actor and I was in awe of him. Charlie Bubbles and Under the Volcano demonstrated his great acting skills as well as a sense that he was one of the most interesting artists on the British scene, not just an actor but a style-maker.We went for lunch somewhere trendy. I remember it was just a few days after the Chernobyl disaster. Michael Douglas was at a nearby table. Our food arrived, the talk was fascinating and I was in heaven. Albert leaned forward confidentially: “Don’t make it obvious but can you tell me if Michael Douglas is eating potatoes?” I looked: his plate was minimal, just a steak and some greens. Albert nodded: “I thought so. He still takes his clothes off in movies.”When we wrapped The Browning Version, Albert told me he’d enjoyed the process and hoped we might do it again, but that he never watched his films or went to festivals. During the shoot, he’d taken every member of the cast and crew out to dinner in groups of about five or six. At the wrap party, he gave everyone a bottle of wine – a fine wine, not some cheap plonk. Such a generous guy.The film was selected for competition at Cannes and the festival director, Gilles Jacob, buttonholed me on the Croisette, urging me to persuade Albert to attend, as he was a dead cert to win the best actor award. Albert was hard to track down as he’d decided not to bother with an agent. Finally we spoke: “Tell Gilles Jacob I’m having a baby,” he said. Albert loved the gee-gees and one of his lady horses was foaling on a stud farm in Ireland. Jacob was not amused: “Zen he does not win ze prize.” (I often ponder on the implied politics.)We remained friends after the film. I was prepping Leaving Las Vegas and Nic Cage was dead-set on doing the film drunk. I asked Albert’s advice over lunch, as I regard his performance in John Huston’s Under the Volcano as definitive. “To play drunk, never overact,” he said. “A drunk puts a glass down with such care and delicacy, the movements become mannered, not exaggerated. If you want the sense of alcohol, keep a small glass of scotch on hand and before each take dip your finger in it and wet your lips.’” I passed the advice on to Nic verbatim. Some of it stuck.Albert was our finest actor, a man of discreet wisdom, compassion and incredible ability. His voice was as beautiful as his face – and his heart. He left a great legacy and his death is a great loss."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6a3c3991d1ad41391ea090f81f25473f8e8cd1b/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce1ffe6c79c5c3d5574c7192ce98e96d","title":"mr jones review agnieszka holland james norton berlin film festival","story":"Agnieszka Holland’s powerful drama stars James Norton as the real-life Welsh journalist who uncovered Stalin’s genocidal famine in UkraineAgnieszka Holland’s Mr Jones is a bold and heartfelt movie with a real Lean-ian sweep. First-time screenwriter Andrea Chalupa has been inspired by her grandfather from eastern Ukraine to script this forthright, valuable drama about Stalin’s genocidal famine there, and the courageous Welsh journalist Gareth Jones who first brought it to the world’s attention in the 1930s. This was despite real personal danger in journeying there covertly – and the subsequent disparagement of Stalin’s lickspittle New York Times correspondent in Moscow, Walter Duranty, a man whom posterity has revealed to be a singularly useless idiot.James Norton brings his A-game to this film, giving a muscular, sympathetic performance as Jones, the idealist intellectual and man of action from Barry in Wales, who has a liking for reciting the medieval Welsh poem The Battle of the Trees and never removes his sweetly owlish spectacles. Peter Sarsgaard is the creepy Duranty and Joseph Mawle has a recurring cameo as George Orwell who was said to be inspired by Jones’s work and might even have named “Mr Jones”, the proprietor of Animal Farm, after him. Jones and Orwell don’t appear to have met in person, but the film imagines a lunch encounter, based on the fact that they shared a London literary agent: Leonard Moore. The movie has also created what appear to be fictional invention composites: chiefly a colleague of Duranty’s called Ada Brooks, played by Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret from the Netflix series The Crown).Holland’s film begins slowly, even unassumingly as young Jones – having already made a splash by interviewing Hitler – uses his London government contacts with David Lloyd George (Kenneth Cranham) to get official permissions to travel to the Soviet Union, on a mission to interview Stalin and discover the truth about the USSR’s colossal economic expansion and its apparently triumphant five-year plan. At first, Jones is restricted to Moscow, condemned to hang around the louche and cynical journo-expat scene presided over there by Duranty. But then he escapes to make a dangerous and deeply unofficial trip to Ukraine, which is where his nightmare begins.At first, the movie is weirdly like The Third Man, with Jones as the Holly Martins figure, the writer in a strange town, having been promised something interesting by someone who is disturbingly no longer around. But by the end of the film it is more like Heart of Darkness. He befriends Ada (Kirby) who wearily tolerates the secret service man following her around as her “big brother”, and Jones is unnerved by a man at one of Duranty’s creepy parties saying that the ennui-stricken hedonistic atmosphere is like Poe’s The Masque of the Red Death.When Jones arrives in the desolate, snowy wastes of eastern Ukraine, he finds out the truth about what Stalin is doing – and perhaps the fact that this is still not well known adds to the horror. There is an excellent and disturbing scene in which Jones is confronted by five tiny children in snowy woodland who sing an eerie song to him about Stalin, and about how cold and hungry and yet loyal they are. It has a sinister, hypnotic effect. Jones is to become tormented by hunger, even gnawing at tree bark. Finally a thin-faced family share their supper with him, which turns out to be the worst horror of all.The movie is partly about Jones’s personal nightmare and his anguish when he was at first disbelieved. But it is also about his final vindication, which perhaps doesn’t have the same power although it’s a necessary part of the story.Holland’s movie really lets rip in the final act, the ordeal in the wasteland of Ukraine. She has a real story to tell – a story that isn’t told enough – and a single, compelling and likable character with which to tell it. It’s a picture with sinew and strength."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000.

As the woman behind the counter pushed the extremely small lump of cheese through the grater, sliced the dusty pink mortadella and scooped from a veined round of gorgonzola, there was chatter – about the uncollected rubbish reeking by the side of the market, a grandchild, but mostly about the gorgonzola itself, and how much the woman’s husband hated it as much as she adored it. We were four in line, one woman twitching with impatience, but that didn’t matter – there was a tub containing about 600g of gorgonzola to be sealed and a story to finish.There are many stories as to the origins of gorgonzola. Franco Angeli recounts the most likely in his thorough and serious book about Italian cheese, Il Grande Patrimonio. At some point in the sixth century, in a town called gorgonzola, an unnamed Lombardian innkeeper found some forgotten rounds of stracchino – a simple cheese traditionally made from the milk of cows after they return stracce (tired) from the high pastures of Valsassina. Forgotten, the rounds had developed musty coats and thin veins of mould within. The innkeeper declared his discovery delectable, and christened it erborinato, a term which probably comes from Lombardian dialect for parsley, for the green-blue marbling that ran through the newly born cheese.For quite some time, the discovery was simply called stracchino verde or stracchino di gorgonzola. It was only at the start of the last century that it became gorgonzola, and was granted the cheese equivalent of a knighthood – DOC or protected status – in 1955.The Milanese food writer Anna Del Conte describes the traditional process well, how gorgonzola is made from both the hot and cold curds of two milkings, how penicillium is added along with the rennet, and the curds pressed into 30cm rounds. Fine needles are then inserted into the rounds, and these holes encourage and help the mould spores to do their thing and grow green-blue-grey veins that marble through the cheese.Gorgonzola was famously aged in the grotte (caves) of Valsassina and Val Brembana, alpine valleys near Milan. Some small producers and farmers still work in this way, continuing to age gorgonzola in mysterious, dark caves, but mostly these conditions are recreated in factories.There are two sorts of gorgonzola. Gorgonzola piccante, as the name suggests, is feisty and piquant the prominent veins in this firmer, at times crumbly, cheese have a musty tang and bite – even a slightly metallic note. Dolce means sweet, and, although it is not actually sweet, gorgonzola dolce is certainly sweeter in nature, the veins lighter both in look and taste, and pleasantly tangy next to the creamy cheese.Salty-sweet blue cheese with its pointed tang craves bitter flavours, according to food writer Niki Segnit, author of The Flavour Thesaurus. She is right, which is why sage, with its inherent musty bitterness, works so well here – as do the optional toasted walnuts, milky but with their slight nicotine-like bitterness, also adding a rubble of texture to the rich sauce. This is a luxurious dishy dish, which – if both people in the couple love gorgonzola as much as they love each other – could be just the thing for February 14th (just don’t choke on a walnut).500g fresh or dried egg tagliatelle30g butter1 garlic clove, peeled and thinly sliced6-8 sage leaves75g gorgonzola, cubed100ml double creamSalt and black pepper1 handful shelled walnuts, roughly choppedBring a large pan of salted water to a boil, add the pasta and cook as per packet instructions.

With Rafael Benitez still defying very logical calls from Richard Keys to pump some of his own money into Newcastle United, special praise must be afforded to Mike Ashley for signing Miguel Almiron for £21m. Times are hard, but Ashley’s generosity knows no bounds. A mere 12 years since he pitched up in the north east, the owner has reached into his wallet to shatter the club’s transfer record, further cementing his status as a club legend. Hurrah for Big Mike ...... said absolutely nobody in a black and white shirt. For while Almiron does look like a good signing, it’s difficult to be that effusive about Ashley when Newcastle find themselves out of the bottom three on goal difference, weighed down by yet another relegation battle and at risk of losing Benitez at the end of the season. Newcastle’s manager may well need to see a bit more ambition before he decides to extend his contract and stay at a club whose vast potential continues to be quashed by a joyless ownership. Benitez has done a brilliant job so far - the man beat Manchester City the other day! - and it’s clear that he could bring back the glory years if he receives proper backing, but at the moment it’s hard not to feel that this is all going to end in tears. In the short term, at least Newcastle can feel reasonably confident about staying up with Benitez in charge. Yet their fans must look at what Wolves are doing this season and wonder what would be possible if the suits were to show some more ambition. Wolves, managed by the very impressive Nuno Espirito Santo, are well on their way to establishing themselves as the best of the rest in their first season back in the top flight and have delighted their supporters with some magnificent football this season. They are looking good in seventh place after consecutive wins over Leicester, West Ham and Everton, have picked up results against every member of the Big Six, have reached the fifth round of the FA Cup and will fancy their chances of making it five wins on the bounce in all competitions this season. Molineux is bound to be rocking and Newcastle are likely to need some of that organisational magic from Benitez to get something here. A creative spark from Almiron also wouldn’t go amiss.

When I started as a junior doctor, I accepted that working nights and being on call was part of the training culture. What I did not envisage was that I’d still be having interrupted sleep 25 years later. My job as an interventional cardiologist means that I am often called into the hospital from home after midnight to deal with patients having heart attacks. Often I’m on call after a full day of routine work. Busy nights on call can take their toll on our physical and emotional wellbeing, and sleep recovery can take several days. I had a particularly challenging night recently when I was called in three times to deal with heart attacks and cardiac arrests. I felt too fatigued to go in for a routine day the next morning.One of the challenges we face as doctors is to recognise when we should or shouldn’t be working. To make high-quality decisions for patient care, including for procedure-led specialities, you have to maintain a sharp focus. As a consultant, I also have to provide leadership to staff around me and communicate well with patients and their families.Routine: To help me sleep, I like to exercise. I go to spinning classes, the gym and do road cycling a few times a week. I have the Calm meditation app on my phone, which I use at night for a few minutes. This really helps me as I do stretching exercises. I write in my journal every night – it can be anything from random thoughts to reflections of gratitude. I avoid screens before bedtime and read 10-20 pages every night. Usually I fall asleep quickly but sometimes I use 4-7-8 breathing exercises to help me.Breakfast show presenter on BBC Asian NetworkI’m definitely a bad sleeper and found it very difficult to overcome once I was given the breakfast slot. I decided to join yoga classes to help me unwind and relax. I train at the gym regularly so that I know I will be tired enough by the end of the day to naturally want to sleep. Routine: Changing the ambience of my home has been important. To make it a more relaxed atmosphere, I have calmrelaxation music playing through my speakers and light candles around the room. These little things make big differences. And I also make sure I am not doing too much throughout the day. I’ve learned to put myself first and bear in mind that health literally is wealth.Singer and actorI have always had disrupted, broken sleep. Over a year, I could count on my fingers the times I have slept through the night. I don’t think my insomnia is fixable: I think it’s in my DNA. I cannot emphasise enough how important exercise is. I have to do at least a three-mile fast walk a day, usually in the afternoon. Movement is incredibly important in helping my body use up my energy. When I’m disciplined enough, detoxing of stimulants and exercising is also a conscious part of my day. Routine: I take books on learning to bed – music theory, colour theory – and usually my brain thinks, “Um, I think I’d rather turn off,” than learn something. But my natural pattern is to sleep from 11pm-1am, then I’m awake till 7am and I only get into deep sleep at around 7-10am. Instead of lying there praying to go to sleep all night, I get up and work. At 4am you do feel a bit jet-lagged and brain-dead, but it’s a very practical time to go through my emails, pay the bills, get rid of the mundane tasks. And there’s times in the summer when I’m awake as the sun is rising and I think this is the best, this is absolutely wonderful. Of course, if you have a 9-5 job this is a real problem, but as a singer, it can work well for me.At my operational unit, the shift pattern is two early mornings, two late afternoons and two nights, followed by four days off. This requires you to swing your body clock forwards and back by 12 hours at least twice a week, so there is always going to be an effect on your sleep. I’m an expert napper and don’t find it odd to be sleeping at any time of the day or night. The key to coping with such varied shift work is to embrace the inevitable changes to your lifestyle – don’t fight it. I try to be kind to myself and plan my life activities around what sleep I can expect the next night. A lot of people struggle with staying asleep for long enough after a night shift to feel refreshed.Routine: My tip would be that you should prepare for sleep the moment you leave work. I wear sunglasses on the way home (as long as it’s safe to do so) and ask my husband to leave all the curtains closed. I would recommend going through all the little things you would normally do. For example, if you like a hot drink before bed or to read a book, then do so, and wear your most comfortable pyjamas and some warm socks – comfort really is king.Everybody asks me about my sleep pattern, so my friend Ben had a T-shirt printed for me. One side reads: “Actually I don’t mind getting up at 3.30am.” The other side says: “Thank you for asking.”But luckily I am a lark. I used to find working on Newsnight really exhausting – live on air at 10.30pm, then a few drinks afterwards with the producers in the Green Room. It was often hard to get to sleep afterwards. A low point came one night after work when I found myself watching Big Brother live – the contestants were all asleep. I definitely get less sleep as I get older.Working on the Today show has had an effect too – it is very odd going to bed at 8pm, especially on New Year’s Eve. Getting to sleep on the first night in a run of shifts is tricky.Routine: I use an eye mask to block out the light, spray the pillow with lavender and put the radio on a timer. I also set three alarm clocks for 3.15am, after one morning when I overslept…Sleep is so unbelievably important in offshore sailing, probably the most important thing, in fact. Plenty of studies have shown what sleep deprivation does to you. When you apply that to solo offshore sailing, it becomes even more relevant. There is such a fine line in this sport between sleeping too little and underperforming or making errors as a result, and sleeping too much and compromising your performance.If I don’t get enough sleep on a race, the consequences are huge. Physically, it can make you more susceptible to things such as sea sickness. But more than that, there’s a point where everything compounds and your body just says “no”. But it’s amazing what the body can do. My philosophy on sleep is to listen to your body. It’s all about cognitive function. When I’m sleep deprived, I stop making good decisions. I also have type 1 diabetes. Obviously that can be very difficult with offshore sailing, but it’s supposed to be challenging and it certainly isn’t impossible. I enjoy proving that it can be done.Routine: How much sleep I get at sea will depend on the length and nature of the race. If I compete in a race over 24 hours, I won’t sleep at all. For a three-day race, I’ll sleep a little but not much. For races over three days, I’ll try to get some sleep from the beginning so that I don’t overexert myself too early on. Generally, I’ll sleep 20-40 minutes every 2-3 hours. The longest I’ll sleep at any one time will be 40 minutes and, if you take a race like the Route du Rhum, which I’ve just finished, that was over 18 days. The longest I’ve stayed awake during a race is probably about 62 hours.Author of Why We DreamWhen I was 22, I went through a period of pretty debilitating insomnia. I was sleeping only a few hours a night and I was basically miserable all the time. I got through that, thankfully, but I never took sleep for granted again. In 2011, I happened to find a book by lucid dream pioneer Stephen LaBerge, and I used his techniques to induce lucid dreams (dreams where you are aware within the dream that you are dreaming). I found that experience mind-boggling, and wanted to learn more about what’s going on in the brain during lucid dreams as well as regular dreams.I started keeping a dream journal, and the entries quickly got longer and more detailed. Training myself to recall more of my dreams has improved my relationship with sleep. It’s helped me appreciate that sleep isn’t some dead zone – we’re still thinking, fantasising, feeling. I went from being anxious about going to sleep to being excited to find out what I’d dream.Routine: We dream every time we have a REM cycle – four or five times a night – even if we forget most of them. Devoting a minute or two a day to thinking about dreams, or a pre-bed thought for your intention to remember them, can improve your dream recall. But the easiest way is to keep a dream journal and write in it first thing in the morning – before making coffee, before looking at your phone, before getting out of bed. Any bodily motion or engagement with the physical environment can jolt you out of your internal world and erase your memories from the night.I love sleep. I value it a lot and I am very careful to ensure I get enough. I think most people are guilty of underestimating the power of sleep. But as an athlete, sleep becomes even more important. We need sleep to recover, to recharge, to train harder, to get better at our sport. It’s easy to view sleep as a necessity rather than value it as something that contributes to your wellbeing. I think a lot of people have an unhealthy relationship with sleep in a world that seems to be getting busier and busier, we often seem to be resenting the fact that it’s necessary.Routine: I generally go to bed pretty early and rarely struggle to get to sleep. I don’t use my phone in bed – I think that is the best tip I could give anyone. Having a good sleep routine leading into a competition really helps. I know I’m going in off a good bank of sleep, so if I have a bad sleep the night before, then that’s OK. I see little point in getting stressed about not being able to sleep. I also know that I can perform well after a bad night’s sleep because I’ve done it before. When I do a bake shift, I’m in from 3am to 10.30am. Those solitary night-time hours are my favourite. I get to play music and work to my own rhythm, unsupervised. There’s no better feeling than rewarding yourself for all your hard work with an early breakfast of an oven-hot baguette and butter. The hours fly past so quickly and by the time everyone else is waking up, my working day is almost finished. Walking out of the bakery into daylight makes me feel like I’ve somehow cheated the system and blagged myself a whole day off. The only downside is it can feel a bit like jet lag without having had the holiday.You have to have a very rich inner life to be a baker. I’ve struggled with adapting my social life to my working schedule. Having a few days in my week where I have to say no to any plans due to early starts was tough to begin with, especially at weekends. I’ve struggled to find people willing to go out dancing with me on a Monday evening! Routine: If I’ve had a day off before an early shift, I always make sure I get enough fresh air and exercise to be able to fall asleep early-ish the evening before. There’s no point in trying to get seven hours of sleep in as I’ll just end up lying awake for hours, but the first shift of the week is usually easy to get through on willpower alone. Once I’m back into the rhythm of the week, I’ll be so tired it’s easy to fall asleep at 6pm. Luckily, there’s an abundance of carbs and coffee and cake to keep me going through a long shift when I’m at work.Editor of Bedtime Stories for Grown-UpsOnce I became a parent I realised that, just as the human race is the most profoundly arrogant species to ignore billions of years of evolution and disregard its light-dark cycles, so can we grownups be very hypocritical when it comes to the bedtime routine we adopt for ourselves, as opposed to that we impose on children.Routine: I would never dream – pun intended – of letting my kids use a device immediately before lights-out. My wife and I like to get them settled in bed early. We read together most nights (they are 10-year-old twins) – a story or a chapter of a book.The oral storytelling tradition has prevailed since Ancient Greece and the bedtime variant is its most precious iteration. Moreover, various fairytale archetypes – such as that behind Jack and the Beanstalk – have been shown to date back more than 5,000 years. This is all quite primal stuff. Bedtime stories are a powerful, beautiful thing for a family and beneficial to all parties on every level. A good story told well, either aloud or not, takes the mind off things by rounding out the day’s own narrative.As for the perfect bedtime story? Nothing too compulsive – you do need to be able to put the book down – nor stressful. Ideally it should be something far-removed from work, too. And definitely nothing about Brexit.

But forging new, lasting connections can be simpleWe let chances to make friends pass us by every day, says Kate Leaver in her book The Friendship Cure. She advises having the courage to take small steps as and when opportunities arise. “Instead of forcing a little small talk with your kindly neighbour,” she says, “ask them in for a cuppa and get to know them. Instead of leaving a party without contact details for your friend’s boyfriend’s sister, add her on Facebook and ask her for coffee some time … You’ll be surprised by how many potential friends there already are in your orbit.”Joining a group, club or class is an effective way to meet people. “Teaming up for a shared activity, project or goal is an experience that can promote bonding and closer connections,” says therapist Miriam Kirmayer. Pursue a challenge or skill you are passionate about, because then you will have a good time and feel more at ease striking up a conversation.It can be scary trying to make friends. What if your overtures are rejected? Leaver and Kirmayer say that a degree of vulnerability is needed in trying to strike up friendships. Put plainly, keeping yourself to yourself isn’t going to help you. Sharing recommendations or letting others in on plans, says Kirmayer, are simple ways to share, which will help build closeness and trust.“Social media can be hugely beneficial for making friends as an adult,” says Kirmayer. Apps such as Bumble BFF (the dating app’s friendship arm) and Peanut (which connects mothers in a local area) can be a good starting point, suggests Kirmayer, as can platforms such as Meetup, where you can sign up to local activities and events. But, she adds, social media does not replace personal interactions: “The more we rely on apps, the less practice we have with the kinds of conversations and experiences that really allow us to create close friendships, as opposed to superficial connections.”As we age, our friendships inevitably shift. According to a 2016 study, we hit our peak number of friendships at the age of 25. When trying to make friends as an adult, clinical psychologist Linda Blair advises not putting too much pressure on any new connections and not expecting too much from one person.A simple tip, says Leaver, is to ask “better, investigative questions” and actively listen. That is not to say you should go around interrogating people – but showing a genuine interest in a person, asking them about themselves, and listening to their answers can take you a long way towards making more meaningful connections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/672e452dc9a001b34ac4baee707b803438952c0e/0_0_6720_4480/master/6720.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58d0345f31f1054855af4e139c7fa914 700w","title":"everything you need to know to function as a successful adult","story":"One of the key benefits of age is wisdom.

I treated education as a passive thing and assumed that other people who were clever were just naturally gifted – I didn’t appreciate the fact that you could educate and improve yourself.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?Smile, be helpful and think of others. Because, as they say, what goes around comes around.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?Everyone should be able to recite a poem or sing a song from memory.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’m contented to have got to where I am. Maybe I should have speculated and I would live in a bigger house now, but I’m just not like that.What do you wish children understood about adults?I don’t think they have to understand adults – I certainly didn’t. Perhaps I still don’t.

But host Pete Hegseth may now have managed to upset the famously germaphobic president – by revealing that he has not washed his hands in a decade.The admission came as Hegseth discussed eating day-old pizza that had not been refrigerated. He did not see any issue with eating the pizza, he said, then added that he didn’t think he had washed his hands in 10 years.“Really,” he said. “I don’t really wash my hands ever.”Met with laughter, he explained: “I inoculate myself. Germs are not a real thing. I can’t see them, therefore they’re not real.”On Twitter on Monday, Hegseth gave mixed messages. He claimed he had been joking and paraphrased the president in blaming the media for being so “self-righteous and angry”. He also said he supported drinking from hosepipes and riding bikes without a helmet.Fox has form, however, when it comes to denying scientific fact just because it is not immediately observable. Analysis by the progressive watchdog Media Matters for America found that Fox News hosts tend to discuss climate change when the weather is particularly cold, seeking to cast doubt over accepted science regarding rising global temperatures.Hegseth, who served with the national guard in Iraq, was once reported to be Trump’s favoured pick to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs.

But what’s going on inside our heads when we fall in love?The American anthropologist Helen Fisher describes the obsessive attachment we experience in love as “someone camping out in your head”.During the early stages of love, the emotional excitement (or some might say stress) raises the body’s cortisol levels, causing a racing heart, butterflies in our stomach and inconveniently sweaty palms. Other chemicals in play are oxytocin, which deepens feelings of attachment, and vasopressin, which has been linked to trust, empathy and sexual monogamy.Actually … in a case of science imitating poetry, the heart has been found to influence the way we experience emotion.Our brain and heart are known to be in close communication. When faced with a threat or when we spot the object of our affection in a crowded room, our heart races. But recently, scientists have turned the tables and shown that feedback from our heart to our brain also influences what we are feeling.One study, led by Prof Sarah Garfinkel of the University of Sussex, showed that cardiovascular arousal – the bit of the heart’s cycle when it is working hardest – can intensify feelings of fear and anxiety. In this study, people were asked to identify scary or neutral images while their heartbeats were tracked. Garfinkel found they reacted quicker to the scary images when their heart was contracting and pumping blood, compared with when it was relaxing. Her work suggests that electrical signals from blood vessels around the heart feed back into brain areas involved in emotional processing, influencing how strongly we think we’re feeling something.Finally, in what must be a contender for one of the most romantic (or mushy) scientific insights to date, couples have been shown to have a tendency to synchronise heartbeats and breathing.Love is merely a madness, Shakespeare wrote. But it is only recently that scientists have offered an explanation for why being in love might inspire unusual behaviour.Donatella Marazziti, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pisa, approached this question after carrying out research showing that people with obsessive compulsive disorder have, on average, lower levels of the brain chemical serotonin in their blood. She wondered whether a similar imbalance could underlie romantic infatuation.She recruited people with OCD, healthy controls and 20 people who had embarked on a romantic relationship within the previous six months (it was also specified that they should not have had sexual intercourse and that at least four hours a day were spent thinking of the partner). Both the OCD group and the volunteers who were in love had significantly lower levels of serotonin, and the authors concluded “that being in love literally induces a state which is not normal”. When the “in love” group were followed up six months later, most of their serotonin levels had returned to normal.A separate study found that people in love have much lower activity in their frontal cortex – an area of the brain crucial to reason and judgment – when they thought of their loved one. Scientists have speculated an evolutionary reason for this which could be termed the “beer goggles” theory: the suspension of reason makes coupling, and hence procreation, far more likely.Sexual orientation has several components, including behaviour, identity, attraction and arousal.As with any scientific investigation, the way questions are framed also makes a difference to the answer. So studies that ask people to pick between two or three categories would miss any more subtle gradations. As Kinsey wrote in 1948: “The living world is a continuum in each and every one of its aspects. The sooner we learn this concerning human sexual behaviour, the sooner we shall reach a sound understanding of the realities of sex.”It’s worth noting that a 2011 study found no differences between brain systems regulating romantic love in homosexuals and heterosexuals.It has been known for decades that sexual orientation is partly heritable in men, based on studies of identical and fraternal twins. In the 1990s, a specific region of the X chromosome was linked to male homosexuality and more recent two specific genes have been found to be more common in gay men.However, the genetic factors that have been identified so far only play a small part in determining sexuality – not all men who have these genes are gay. Research on the genetic basis of female sexuality lags behind, which some have attributed to it being more difficult to study. Others might conclude that there has simply been less effort to understand this topic.There are other biological factors at play as well. One of the most robust findings in sexual-orientation research is the fraternal-birth-order effect: gay men tend to have a greater number of older brothers compared with straight men. This is a biological influence rather than a social one and is a big effect, increasing the odds of a man being gay by roughly a third. In women, there is evidence that pre-natal hormone exposure can make a difference to sexual orientation.Pheromones are chemical signals that are used to communicate and alter the behaviour of others. The first pheromone discovered, in the 1950s, was a substance called bombykol that female silkworms emit to attract males. Ever since then, the search has been on – not least by perfume manufacturers – to find a human equivalent. There have been some tentative claims.For instance, a known pig pheromone, androstenone, has been found in the human armpit. When female pigs on heat get a whiff of the substance, which is found in boars’ saliva, they adopt the mating stance. However, there is not yet any convincing evidence for real-life “Lynx effect” chemicals in men and women. The strongest contender to date for a human pheromone is a chemical secreted from glands in the nipples of breastfeeding mothers. When wafted under any sleeping baby’s nose, the child responds with sucking and rooting behaviour.Recently scientists have shown that some people may be genetically predisposed to being unfaithful. One study of nearly 7,400 Finnish twins and their siblings found a significant link between the vasopressin gene and infidelity in women.Another study, by scientists at the Kinsey Institute, in Indiana, showed that certain variants of the gene for the dopamine receptor were more likely to be unfaithful and also more likely to be repeatedly unfaithful.Why We Love: the Nature and Chemistry of Romantic Love: Helen FisherSplendors and Miseries of the Brain: Semir ZekiRomeo and Juliet: William Shakespeare"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bceb6220df7c458823d730e8bc053f30c712a541/153_116_3260_1957/master/3260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f143ea26ae410d9f998a06a512d129b6","title":"is the eu ready for a no deal brexit podcast","story":"Unless an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks, Britain will crash out of the European Union without a deal.

They say basic religious freedoms are under threat.The argument over whether schools should teach children about LGBT issues arose in a Birmingham state school last month when 400 predominantly Muslim parents signed a petition calling for the topic to be dropped from the curriculum.In November a Christian parent threatened legal action against her child’s state primary school in south London, claiming it had forced pupils to take part in a “gay pride parade”.Last July the DfE said all state schools would teach children about relationships and health education, including LGBT issues, from September 2020.Its draft guidance to independent schools is non-statutory but Ofsted inspectors and the DfE will take it into account when assessing schools or taking action. The advice is expected to be formally issued later this year.Objections have been raised by independent schools with a conservative religious character and by parents citing religious freedom. The letter supporting the new guidance expresses concern that the DfE plans to water down its advice.Any dilution would pose “a significant safeguarding risk to LGBT young people, who are still subject to significant levels of homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying,” the letter says.“Challenging LGBT discrimination in school lessons and in everyday school life is fundamental to fostering equality at school and in wider society,” it says. “Being LGBT and having a religion are not mutually exclusive. LGBT people are members of all communities, across religions and non-religious worldviews.”Among the signatories are the Rev Jeffrey John, the dean of St Albans Laura Janner-Klausner, senior rabbi to Reform Judaism Fiyaz Mughal, director of Faith Matters Andrew Copson, chief executive of Humanists UK and Kevin Courtney and Mary Bousted, joint general secretaries of the National Education Union.Copson said: “There is widespread support for LGBT inclusion in schools and it is imperative that LGBT lessons in independent schools are not diluted out of fear that it could offend some religious groups.“Providing an inclusive education for all pupils, including LGBT students, so that they can learn and develop in freedom must be the priority for schools and we urge the department against the watering down of its draft proposals.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want all children to grow up to become happy, healthy and safe, which is why we are making relationships education compulsory for all primary schools as well as relationships and sex education compulsory for all secondary schools.“The draft guidance is clear that teaching should look at healthy relationships and that all pupils learn about equality. The draft guidance is also clear that relationships and sex education should be relevant to all pupils, whatever their developing sexuality or identity, in an age-appropriate way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f86a1c2b2316c22a3c2c28043da1fb231ade7ff0/0_34_6399_3840/master/6399.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d96383e21113ce4a757544d3212464a","title":"supposed backer of no ships ferry firm says they had no deal","story":"Arklow Shipping saw itself as just one of many prospective investors in Seaborne FreightChris Grayling’s Brexit ferry fiasco has taken a further twist after the reported backer of the startup company with no ships that was awarded a £13.8m contract said it never had a stake in the venture.Sources at Arklow Shipping, which operates 55 dry bulk vessels in northern Europe, said it had been in talks with Seaborne Freight twice last year, but it “never had any agreement” with either Seaborne or the Department for Transport to run a service from Ramsgate to Ostend.The revelations came as the company behind Eurotunnel launched a high court action against the DfT, accusing the government of a “secretive and flawed procurement exercise” for the backup ferry service in the event of a no-deal Brexit.It raises further questions over the transport secretary’s decision to award Seaborne the contract, which the government cancelled at the weekend, saying it had become clear the company could not fulfil it because Arklow had decided “to step back from the deal”.Sources at Arklow said it had considered investing in Seaborne and providing two ferries, but saw itself as “just a prospective investor, probably in a long line of others”. When it was discovered last week that Seaborne did not have a port agreement in place in Ramsgate, it decided not to pursue talks any further.“If you don’t have an agreement with a port, how can you run a ferry service?” the source said. “We never had an agreement with Seaborne, so when it was reported that we were a backer, that was not the case.“Seaborne approached us a year ago and we had no further contact until the end of December. There was nothing signed, we were just prospective investors that they had approached like many others, I imagine. We had no agreements with Seaborne or with the Department for Transport.”Downing Street said on Monday that Theresa May continued to have full confidence in Grayling, amid calls for his resignation.The contract with Seaborne was announced at the end of December and quickly the subject of ridicule, after it emerged the company had no ships and appeared to have copied and pasted terms and conditions on its website from a pizza delivery business.Arklow wrote to Grayling on 18 January stating it intended to provide equity finance for the purchase of two vessels and an equity stake in the project. However, in the past week, it discovered there was no deal for access to the port and decided not to proceed.The DfT said Arklow’s backing had given it confidence in the viability of the deal and it stood by the due diligence carried out on Seaborne.A spokesman for Seaborne said: “It is with regret that Seaborne Freight is not in a position to add any further comment, as we remain bound by a confidentiality clause with the DfT.”Grayling is under further pressure to explain how Seaborne was awarded the contract after weekend reports that Ramsgate authorities could not afford to run the port.Questions remain about the procurement process after the DfT relied on an emergency exemption provided for by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 to award the contract. Eurotunnel has accused the government of “anti-competitive” and “distortionary” behaviour.Lawyers for Channel Tunnel Group Ltd and France-Manche SA, which operates the Channel Tunnel, say the contracts totalling £108m were awarded through a “secretive and flawed procurement process”. But the DfT argues the “extreme urgency” of no-deal preparations justified the process.At a hearing in London on Monday, Eurotunnel’s barrister, Daniel Beard QC, said the procurement process for “additional capacity for transport of goods across the Channel” had been “undertaken without any public notice being issued”.Ewan West, representing Grayling, told the judge the process was only for “maritime freight” services and, therefore, Eurotunnel “could never have provided that capacity” and “could not have complied” with the terms of the contracts.The judge scheduled a four-day, expedited trial for 1 March, given the “obvious” urgency of the case and the “very important public interest matters” involved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b2172281f28f584b0d49f064ab8f9cdf1b8cc4e/0_110_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f74d7a27e8361af0be8c3c210bb600bf","title":"theresa mays letter is addressed to corbyn but aimed elsewhere","story":"The PM is clearly trying to quell a Tory rebellion and provoke a Labour oneTheresa May’s return letter to Jeremy Corbyn is full of some surprisingly warm words for the Labour leader and his offer of talks to come to a Brexit compromise.But the friendly tone masks two key things: an attempt to tease out Labour isions on free movement and to publicly expose how little space there really is between Labour’s Brexit tests and May’s negotiated deal, meaning May has little appetite for any more radical changes.It is also clearly aimed not just at Corbyn and his MPs but at the rebels in May’s own party. The letter offers an opportunity for fresh talks between the camps “as soon as possible” and engages on the substance of Labour’s five demands set out in a letter to May last week.Downing Street will hope that a willingness to appear open to further discussions with Labour will be a shot across the bows of some Brexiters who fear the prime minister will soften her Brexit deal to win Labour votes.What the letter does not do is accept Labour’s key term for voting through a Brexit deal: a commitment to seeking a permanent customs union.May challenges Corbyn as to why he believes the Labour policy of a permanent customs union, which would involve requesting a say over future trade deals from the EU, would be better than the terms she has negotiated.The prime minister says her deal “explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union” and pointedly asks the Labour leader: “I am not clear why you believe it would be preferable to seek a say in future EU trade deals rather than the ability to strike our own deals?”May’s letter also makes an uncomfortable challenge to Labour on free movement. She says her own plans for close alignment with the EU’s customs union and single market “provide for the closest relationship possible” outside full membership, a key demand from Labour. But she pushes Corbyn to say how he would go further than that without remaining within the single market.“This would mean accepting free movement, which Labour’s 2017 general election manifesto made clear you do not support,” she added. No 10 will be well aware at how the debate is raging within Labour at the moment about what the party’s policy should be on free movement. Ending free movement is May’s reddest of red lines.Labour’s Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, has hinted at reopening that option. “I actually think we get stuck on the freedom of movement discussion too early without saying, what does a principled, effective and fair immigration policy look like?” he said.Yet the most striking point about the letter overall is not the differences between the two leaders but the similarities, perhaps an uncomfortable point for critics of both May and Corbyn.On security, Corbyn’s final demand, May even suggests that she and Corbyn form a united front to push Brussels for more concessions to allow UK access to some intelligence tools that the EU has been reluctant to let Britain use without the oversight of the European court of justice.In the letter, too, comes confirmation that May is seeking to legislate to ban any rollback of workers’ rights – the “non-regression lock” demanded by many Labour MPs and trade unions – as well as a vote in parliament on whether to accept new European standards to keep pace with Europe. Some MPs, however, would like to see Britain automatically uprate its standards as the EU does.The section is full of cosy language praising “Conservative and Labour governments” of the past that have “led the way” in high standards.Here, May reveals another key audience she hopes her letter will reach. The section is carefully aimed not just at Corbyn but at Labour MPs who May hopes to persuade to vote for her deal, even if their leader does not."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b213caf2b8cab0720bb48bb71c8465941e8bf48f/117_0_1246_747/master/1246.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f41049b854e014ec174e4b99b26972e5","title":"did you solve it on the tiles with the new escher","story":"The solutions to today’s puzzlesEarlier today I set you the following puzzles.

She added: “But they are telling me that universal credit is making their situation worse, not better.”Rudd, the former home secretary who has pledged a more humane approach to the benefits system since taking the work and pensions job in November, said: “I believe and hope that the changes we have made in terms of accessing early funds will have reduced insecurity, but of course I will take an early interest in the report that she is producing.”Universal credit has faced persistent criticism that its complexity and, in particular, delays to initial payments, have caused many people making new claims or moving from other benefits to go into debt, with some needing to use food banks.When he was a junior work and pensions minister, Damian Hinds, now the education secretary, said he did not expect the further rollout of universal credit to mean more people having to use food banks.In October, another junior minister in the department, Alok Sharma, rejected the findings of a report that said the shift to universal credit had caused many more people to use food banks, saying there were “very many reasons” why people used them.Ministers have sought to address the hardship caused by delays to initial payments by changing time limits and making it easier for claimants to receive an immediate sum as a loan.Since taking over at the department, Rudd has paused the planned mass “migration” of existing benefit claimants to universal credit pending another trial and introduced changes such as making payments directly to women if they are the household’s main carer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9c1c0f57ed4af9e399a79fbe3094e1946d4e0b/0_105_3158_1895/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d6a21974952cc73a9ec1c98aaf4ed0d","title":"england kicking on strategy wales power game","story":"France’s death by a thousand kicks at Twickenham started the week before in Paris.

England took that and seized upon it.To be brutally honest, Sunday was as bad as the French can play – there was no structure and very limited awareness of what they were trying to do but again England stuck to their game plan and took their opportunities. France’s biggest problem was having Morgan Parra and Louis Picamoles stuck in the back field. Parra is a world-class player but England targeted him and France just could not react.A lot of teams leave their No 9 in the back field – Saracens are one example – and often if he’s kicking from the back of a ruck or maul, the 9 will stay after the kick chase and the No 8 will often stay if the maul has gone to ground or he is the last man up from an exit ruck. But these guys have got to be practising fielding high balls and Parra and Picamoles looked completely exposed.Huget dropped the first one in the first minute but you would have expected to see him back there fielding most of the kicks. From that first minute onwards you knew what was coming – Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly and Henry Slade kept on poking the ball in behind, trying to keep it in play but it really was not a problem if it went out because the France lineout was malfunctioning as well. If your lineout is not going well and you are not dealing with kicks in the back field, you can’t relieve pressure and you are in for a long day at the office.England spotted it and took advantage but I’m sure it was part of the plan coming into the match. It strikes me that their open-field kicking percentage has gone up significantly in the last two matches – 47 open-field kicks is a lot – and what I’m seeing a lot of is kicks on kicks. If Ben Youngs is sending up a box-kick and England are winning it back they are identifying quickly the picture of who is in the back field – a lot of the time against France it was no one – and finding the space. Youngs kicks again immediately. A lot of teams sometimes fall into the trap of box-kicking, getting the ball back and trying to play but actually it’s a very good time to kick again. The defence is not set, they are anticipating getting the ball so get into an attacking shape and all of a sudden no one is reacting.Youngs did that brilliantly, Farrell as well and England are benefiting from having two very capable left-footed kickers behind him in Slade and Daly. As soon as Farrell makes the pass England have moved the point of attack. That five- or 10-metre pass means the defending team has to get up because England’s wings come into play. England’s ability to put another pass in and kick from the edge then brings the defensive full-back up and if the opposing wings switch off it creates space in the back field.The question now is how do Wales counter that and will England change their game plan in Cardiff? Firstly, Wales have to disrupt England’s rhythm. They must pressure England’s kickers and make sure Youngs is at the bottom of a ruck so he is not able to kick. If Wales kick to England, they should mix it up and make it as unpredictable as possible. Or keep the ball in hand.England will have a similar focus to the first two weeks and will try to put pressure on the back three. A lot will depend on whether Liam Williams is at full-back or if Leigh Halfpenny returns. If it is Williams I’d expect England to keep the ball away from him, George North can be turned and targeted aerially, so can Josh Adams, so they will go after the wings. If it is Halfpenny I’d expect a lot more contestable kicks because he is not the biggest but is so good positionally that there simply won’t be the same amount of space.But more important for England will be the power game. We’re not seeing a lot of play from deep, not a great deal of in-phase play so they will look to win the territorial battle and use the power of Manu Tuilagi and the Vunipolas, should Mako be fit, in the right areas of the field. England will go to Cardiff with the belief that their forwards will win the battle against the Wales pack.You wouldn’t see England kicking as much against the southern hemisphere teams because Australia and New Zealand have a greater ability to play more from deep. England want to win the Six Nations though and they are employing the right tactics to do so."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps. We’d like your help in documenting their recoveryEngland and Wales have about 140,000 miles of footpaths, but it is estimated more than 10,000 have been lost from current maps. Volunteers have been working tirelessly to rediscover them and put in legal applications for the recovery of lost paths before a government deadline in 2026 after which claims will no longer be accepted.If you have already found a lost footpath, how did you find and identify it? If you put in an application for a path to be recovered we’d also like to hear about it.Below are some tips on how to rediscover a lost footpath:1. The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way. Check your local walking groups for people actively walking along unmapped routes to help establish this right.You can share your tips and stories with us in the encrypted form below.

She has been working for two weeks straight, with no break at the weekend, and she has six-year-old twins, a boy and a girl. “So I’m a wee bit tired. But good, really good,” she says. She is dipping into her free time to talk about her new TV series, Flack, because she is not only starring in it, but executive-producing it, too, and it is co-produced through her own company, Casm. She has spent five years trying to get it off the ground, in stops and starts, and they finished filming it just four days before we meet. Hence the tiredness? She nods. “It’s not a name-only credit. I’m a huge control freak. I’m involved in every single aspect of every single decision.”In person, Paquin is brisk, earnest and articulate, and careful with her words. She was born in Canada in 1982, but grew up in New Zealand, then moved to the US as a teenager for work. She has been in front of the camera since she was nine, when she was cast in Jane Campion’s film The Piano. “I entered this industry in a very backwards sort of way,” she says. “I did one job, won an Oscar, and then people said: ‘Ooh, you have a career now.’” She points out, though, that there is a wealth of talented women in her age group, which means she will “still have to audition my arse off for stuff I really want”, but it does mean that she can generally work on things that she wants to. “I do have the luxury of being a little more choosy because of the circumstances of my career.”In Flack, Paquin is Robyn, a hard-living, self-destructive type who works in the crisis-management area of public relations. The show is a lot of fun, and reminds me what good TV was like before shows developed grand cinematic ambitions. It’s outrageous, a little bit camp and darkly comic in tone. “Oh, it goes places, and it keeps going places,” Paquin says with a smile, admitting that it speaks to her sense of humour. In the first episode, Robyn has to cover up a philandering TV chef and a footballer’s drug-fuelled gay tryst, all the while juggling her own issues, which seem to involve a lot of cocaine. “Some people will be offended, other people will be laughing so hard they’re going to snort coffee through their nose while they’re watching it.” That’s a state of affairs that suits her. “I want people to absolutely love it, or, possibly, be violently like: ‘How could you?’” Would she take that as a compliment? “Oh, yeah. It means that we did it properly.”Oliver Lansley, who wrote and created Flack, told Deadline Hollywood that with Robyn, he wanted to create a female character who could stand alongside “difficult men” such as Tony Soprano, Mad Men’s Don Draper and Breaking Bad’s Walter White. Paquin feels passionately that stories about “complicated women” should be told. “I mean, take Dexter. Male protagonists get to quite literally be serial killers and the audience still loves them. Whereas traditionally, if female characters put one foot out of line, from the sort of patriarchal ideals of what a perfect woman is like, then you have to watch them being punished for it. And I really am enjoying the fact that I’m part of a generation of women in film where we can just tell interesting, complicated stories about people who happen to be women.”What’s changed? “The power balance has changed,” she says. “There are more women in executive and behind-the-scenes roles who have just had enough of being told what we can and can’t do. And women like myself going: ‘OK, I’ve been doing this for 27 years I’m not going to sit around and wait for those roles to show up. I’m going to go out there, find it, create it and make it happen for myself.’”There is a reason, she suggests, that it takes more time for women to step into positions of power. “One has to work extra-hard as a woman in a very male-dominated industry. As an actress walking on to a film set, you’re guilty until proven innocent. They assume you’re going to be a pain in the arse, high-maintenance and difficult, and you usually spend the first couple of weeks having to work hard to prove that you’re not going to be a problem because you’re a woman. And I think we’re all just collectively done with that.”I ask her about her experiences of being an adolescent in a business like this, and she takes a deep breath. “You’d need a year to really get into the broad strokes of that one. Look, I’ve had some really amazing experiences, and I’ve had some absolutely horrific experiences. People treat people who have no power, sometimes, in ways that are completely unacceptable. But when you’re a child and you don’t know any different, and you don’t want to get into trouble, you just keep your mouth shut.”She is cautiously optimistic that, in these more open times, sets are being made safer, and women might be able to make it a better industry. “When I see younger girls on set, or kids, that I once looked at thinking: ‘Please, dear God, get out of the film industry,’ I now think: ‘Actually, we might be able to make this a safe environment for young people in positions of no power.’”Paquin almost gave up acting in her late teens. She enrolled at Columbia University, planning to study French and English literature. Her mother is an English teacher, so she thought she might follow in her footsteps, or perhaps write. But theatre reignited her enthusiasm, and she went on to appear in a series of blockbusters, including a stint as Rogue in the X-Men film franchise. In 2008, she took her first TV role, as Sookie Stackhouse in the supernatural series True Blood, and it was a huge hit.In 2014, while promoting the show, she sat down with the talkshow host Larry King, who asked her a series of what she found to be intrusive questions about its sex scenes. “I’m not saying that the generation thing is an excuse … but I do legitimately think he is of a generation where certain kinds of entertainment didn’t exist, probably, when he was growing up,” she says. Would that line of questioning happen now, even five years later? “I do think in general people are a little bit more careful about how they ask women questions about anything to do with sex, sexuality and provocative content. As they should be.”She adds that he got more stick for asking her about being bisexual, and whether she was a “former bisexual” because she had married Stephen Moyer, her True Blood co-star. “He got the shit kicked out of him by the LGBT community.” Paquin, who came out as bisexual in 2010, says that misunderstandings are fairly common. “People understand the version of the world they live in, and if it’s outside their experience, then sometimes it frightens people, or they just don’t get it. And that’s fine.” She has worked with LGBT advocacy charities for years, and her Twitter and Instagram feeds suggest she’s more than happy to get into discussions with people who disagree with her. “I don’t want to hit somebody over the head with something and go: ‘You’re stupid.’ I want to explain things to people,” she says.With Flack, there is a sense that Paquin is pulling back the curtain on showbiz. It is heightened, of course, but nevertheless it speaks of the uneasy relationship between the illusion of fame and the reality of it. “When you have a job that involves being everything to everybody at all times, being a chameleon, what does that do to your sense of your real self? How do you maintain a grasp on reality when your job is constantly playing with reality?” she asks. She’s talking about her character, but I tell her that it sounds like a good question for an actor, too. “Yes,” she laughs, quietly. “You could say that.”Flack starts on Thursday 21 February at 10pm on W."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e97747287544f9938dfaee40ba9fc860e169a22/0_103_2052_1231/master/2052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61b1e1f4a252831a3f324012fdf70813","title":"bbc to bring back crackerjack sam and mark cbbc iplayer","story":"Bid to get children to watch more TV also includes revival of The Demon HeadmasterThe BBC is to revive the children’s TV show Crackerjack, 35 years after it was last aired.The broadcaster announced that the programme, which originally ran from 1955 until 1984, will be made at MediaCityUK, in Salford, by BBC Children’s in-house production team. It will air next year on CBBC and iPlayer.The programme was introduced every week with the phrase: “It’s Friday, it’s five to five … It’s Crackerjack!” It was originally filmed in front of an audience of children in London, and included teams of children competing in games, as well as comedy and music acts.The BBC said the show would be updated for “today’s connected generation giving them an all-round, interactive experience while retaining the beating heart of what etched Crackerjack into the affections of British children for three decades.” There will be 10 episodes in the series.The programme will include a return of the Double or Drop game, in which children are chosen from the audience to answer questions, winning prizes for correct answers and cabbages for incorrect ones. Contestants have to hold their prizes for the duration of the competition without dropping them. As in the original show, Crackerjack pencils will be awarded to contestants.This series will be presented by the children’s TV presenters Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes, who will follow in the footsteps of Eamonn Andrews (who later presented This Is Your Life), Leslie Crowther, Michael Aspel, Ed Stewart and Stu Francis.Cheryl Taylor, the head of content for BBC Children’s, said: “Crackerjack is just one of several fabulous series that Children’s in-house productions have developed this year. It’s the perfect vehicle for our much-loved stars Sam and Mark and promises to usher in a new era of frenetic family fun and whizzbang audience antics.”The production team has also announced other new commissions, including a revival of the 1990s children’s drama The Demon Headmaster and the mystery drama Get Even, about four teenage girls who expose injustice.The Demon Headmaster is to be remade with a “super head” of an academy school as the villain. The show, which is based on the children’s books by Gillian Cross, follows a group of children who realise their headmaster is using hypnotism to gain complete control of their school.Greg Childs, director of the Children’s Media Foundation, said reviving Crackerjack was a good way of appealing to parents, but added: “We wonder whether it will be as attractive to children, especially those who have migrated in great numbers to watching content on their personal devices, and mainly short-form content on YouTube. It will be interesting to see if the digital plans behind Crackerjack will help solve that problem.”He welcomed the news that the BBC was investing in live action content for older children by commissioning Get Even. “We have been calling for additional content for the upper end of children’s programming (12- to 15-year-olds) for some time now, as this age group is currently underserved by the public service broadcasters,” he said.In December 2017 the government launched a £60m fund to help make children’s television programmes in Britain, in reaction to a sharp increase in children watching foreign-made programmes on Netflix and YouTube.The media regulator Ofcom has previously called on British broadcasters to produce more original programming for young people, and last month it published research showing that UK children aged five to 15 spent more time online than they did watching TV in a typical day.While they found children’s online time stopped increasing for the first time in 2018, averaging at two hours and 11 minutes per day, the amount of time they spent watching TV every day fell again, by eight minutes, to an hour and 52 minutes.Research published in October last year found that 16- to 34-year-olds spent about an hour and 20 minutes a day consuming BBC content, around half of the average amount of time across all age groups. It found one in eight young people did not watch or listen to any BBC programmes at all in a given week.“The decline in use among young people is a concern, not only because this audience group is less well served but because young people are critical for the future relevance and success of the BBC,” said Ofcom."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c541f68bfad3272316acafd63bf3182d6be1694/0_431_4039_2425/master/4039.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5188a05823c415bf47aac32ca8461bc","title":"patronising and totally false my despair at tv about gypsies a very british history bbc","story":"After a decade of watching shows that are part Stars in Their Eyes, part nature programme, I’ve tried to make one that gets at the truth about Gypsy life and history Over the past decade, Gypsy documentaries have been doing something insidious. Armed with patronising, misleading voiceovers delivered in cut-glass English accents – “Tonight, we reveal what it’s really like to be a Traveller woman!” … “From as soon as she’s old enough to walk, every Traveller girl dreams of her wedding day!” – it’s a narrative that’s part Stars in Their Eyes, part nature show. These programmes conjure the feeling that you’re getting an intricate and balanced depiction of a hidden world. In fact, the reverse is true on all counts. Poorly researched and stripped of context, they can create the impression that social problems spring up out of nowhere that Gypsies and Travellers are magically immune to common human concerns about work, money, health and their children’s education that everyone from a certain background, or a certain gender, is the same.You’d be forgiven for not knowing much about Gypsy history. Not just because Romany Gypsies are a small minority in modern Britain, but because most books, films and TV shows that feature them make no mention of history. In fiction and in drama, Gypsies tend to be used as a simple plot device: a mysterious world for a protagonist to escape to, or a red herring in a murder mystery. In other words, a grab-bag of weirdness and weirdos. Ahistorical and disconnected, they camp on the fringes of storylines, with whatever clothes, accents or nonsensical talents the production feels like giving them.With the opener of A Very British History, we’ve tried to make a film that’s different in several significant ways. It harks back to the 1960s – a time of great change for Romany people, due to restrictive new laws on caravans, fewer halting sites and less work in their traditional agricultural trades – and uses footage from that time, much of which has never been seen before. We witness brutal evictions being resisted with ever more extreme tactics: one Bromley councillor, wide-eyed with alarm, warns that local people go about “in fear of molestation” when Gypsies are around. Though many hotels and inns at the time displayed signs saying “NO GYPSIES”, here we see that one Kent pub went further, actually painting the words right by its doors. Incredibly, that same pub later played host to the first ever meeting of the Gypsy Council.There are smiles as well as politics and tears. Film of the fast-paced horse trotting at Cumbria’s Appleby Fair, then and now, shows that much has remained the same at this rambunctious rural event. We see men with swept-back hair haggling over a scrap metal deal in the middle of an orchard. One of them, Jim Riley, spins out his life philosophy from the wheel of his Bedford truck: “I like to be free. I like to be my own boss. Do what I like, go where I like, come back when I like. You know, so long as I just get a bit of a living I’m quite happy. I ain’t a rich bloke and never will be.”Making this film was only possible because the 1960s was a “golden age” of broadcasting about Gypsies. Social documentarians such as Philip Donnellan, Ewan MacColl, Peggy Seeger and Charles Parker were hard at work. They interviewed with respect, crafting subtle and sympathetic narratives a world away from the oversimplifications of recent documentaries. They also let people’s actual voices be heard. It seems unbelievable now, but before this time, actors would be hired to re-record comments given by Gypsies and other people whose accents were deemed too coarse to broadcast. These programmes balanced the hard facts of Traveller life and community tensions with an appreciation of the history that led up to them. There was a tangible hinterland which had led Gypsy life to be both romanticised and demonised. They recorded tales of faerie folk, told by Scottish Traveller matriarchs in mediaeval “bender” tents in Highland glens captured songs in the Romani language and they recorded a Birmingham Labour councillor saying that Gypsies who refused to fit in should be “exterminated”.This episode of A Very British History points out historical ironies, like Romany tradesmen building houses on the very spot where their families used to stop in horse-drawn wagons. There are interviews with people too scared to live near Gypsies, and with Gypsies forced to live in a line of trailers that stretched for miles down one of the country’s busiest trunk roads. We even hear from the son of the prolific novelist Barbara Cartland, who recalls how his mother fought to set up a caravan site for Romany families near her glamorous home in the Hertfordshire countryside. And we meet a silver horse called Fifty Shades of Grey.• A Very British History starts on Monday at 9pm on BBC Four."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a24b94f587af1c6c869b938360bbb182a8f6feb0/0_258_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25423254a160eac639c9de10356a7429","title":"green new deal alexandria ocasio cortez ed markey","story":"Republicans call it a ‘social manifesto’, environmental groups hail it, and some say it doesn’t go far enoughCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, along with dozens of co-sponsors, have introduced a vision for the Green New Deal. One Republican called it a “socialist manifesto”. Many environmental advocacy groups have hailed it, but some say it doesn’t go far enough. Others warn that its broad scope and the long list of progressive social programs it endorses could hinder its climate efforts.The proposal outlines the broad principles of a plan simultaneously to fight inequity and tackle climate change. It does not contain policy details or advocate for specific ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But with a broad brush it aims to make the US carbon-neutral – net zero carbon emissions – in 10 years.The Green New Deal recognizes that transition would require massive change. It endorses ways of ensuring that vulnerable populations – including the poor, people of color, indigenous populations and communities already facing environmental degradation – take part in the planning process and benefit from the green economy.No. But it would aim to offset any remaining greenhouse gas pollution with forests that absorb carbon dioxide, for example. It does not specifically address what role nuclear power or fossil fuels with carbon capture technologies would play. Nuclear power represents half of the carbon-free energy in the US, but it runs on mined uranium. Fossil fuels with carbon capture would still require drilling and cause pollution.Incredibly ambitious, both on climate change and with its reimagining of society.US climate efforts so far have focused on the power sector, which is probably the easiest to decarbonize. Many states and localities have continued that work even as the federal government ignores climate change.But coal is being replacing with both renewable power and natural gas. Natural gas has a smaller carbon footprint than coal but still causes climate change.Additionally, climate advocates and policy experts across the country have not typically tried to address every contributor to global warming at once or while addressing other societal issues. This kind of system-wide thinking and planning would be difficult to adopt.The energy shift would require a major investment, as would the social programs highlighted in the Green New Deal. The resolution does not suggest a source for that money. The politics of the plan are also difficult, with Republicans in control of the Senate and the White House vehemently opposed to it, and with some Democrats split over whether it is the right approach.The goals of the document include a “10-year national mobilization” to:Exceeding 1.5C of warming by half a degree will worsen the risks of drought, floods, extreme heat and poverty for hundreds of millions of people.The proposal lays out numerous “crises”, including declining life expectancy for many Americans, as well as wage stagnation and income inequality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e13a8049072619267dd886a3c7916eb49ebdc6a/0_31_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d3abcaf1a25c635a7e13c01e56a97c","title":"mike pompeo to meet viktor orban on tour of central europe","story":"US secretary of state will dine with Hungarian leader before travelling to other countries The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has embarked on a tour of central European countries aimed at countering the influence of Russia and China, after a decade in which the region has been sidelined by US diplomacy.Pompeo is in Budapest on Monday, where he will have several meetings before dining with Viktor Orbán, the country’s rightwing prime minister. Orbán was shunned under Barack Obama’s administration over his populist style and moves against media freedoms and the rule of law.His actions and words on migration, speaking of a threat to “Christian culture” and building a fence along the country’s border, are similar to much of Donald Trump’s rhetoric. The Trump administration has taken a new approach, prioritising engagement over criticism.In a briefing to journalists before the trip, a senior administration official said: “It has been, in part, the lack of robust US engagement over the last decade or so in central Europe that has created the vacuums that China and Russia have very readily filled.”Orbán has struck up warm relations with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, leading many to fear that Russia could be using Budapest as a base for spying and other influence operations in Europe. While Trump has frequently praised Putin, the state department has made it clear that countering Moscow’s influence in Europe remains a priority.“Vladimir Putin showed up in Hungary twice last year alone and the last time a US president was in Budapest was 2006,” said the senior administration official.Trump’s friend David Cornstein, an 80-year-old former jewellery magnate, was appointed ambassador to Hungary last year. He has been tasked with building a new relationship with Orbán. Cornstein said he would not publicly criticise Orbán and an Obama-era policy to provide funding to Hungary’s struggling independent media outlets was quietly scrapped.Despite this, Cornstein’s requests to the Hungarian government to keep open the Central European University, an English-language institution founded by George Soros that has come under fire from Orbán, were ignored. The university is beginning a gradual move to Vienna after being refused accreditation by Hungarian authorities. This has lead some to question whether engagement was the right approach.A leaked Hungarian diplomatic cable from December, published by the investigative website direkt36, suggested there is frustration in Washington over Hungarian intransigence on several issues considered as key to US interests.During his visit, Pompeo hopes to make progress on the signing of a new defence cooperation agreement between the US and Hungary, which has long stalled. He will also raise the issue of energy security.Despite the focus on engagement, Pompeo will also meet civil society groups in Budapest, including those targeted by the Hungarian government for providing legal assistance to refugees attempting to enter Hungary. The government has smeared many such groups as “Soros agents”, which are working to destroy Hungary.On Tuesday, Pompeo will travel to Bratislava, where he will meet Slovakia’s leaders, before visiting Warsaw for a US-sponsored conference on the Middle East. The conference, which has been received warily by the EU, is expected to focus on Iran.

She received €10,000 (£8,800).Previous recipients include the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and the American civil rights activist Tommie Smith.Phuc was nine when a South Vietnamese plane dropped napalm bombs on her village in 1972, believing it harboured North Vietnamese troops.The scene of Phuc running down a road in tears, naked and severely burned was captured by the Associated Press photographer Nick Ut, who won a Pulitzer prize for the image in 1973.Ut, then 21, drove Phuc to hospital where he demanded doctors treat her. “I cried when I saw her running,” said Ut in 2012. “If I don’t help her and if something happened and she died I think I’d kill myself after that.”Days after the image shocked the world, another journalist found out Phuc had survived.Christopher Wain, a British television journalist, fought to have her transferred to a US-run unit equipped to deal with her severe injuries.“I had no idea where I was or what happened to me,” Phuc said. “I woke up and I was in the hospital with so much pain, and then the nurses were around me.

Video: Bryan O\u0027Brien\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFor the first time in 35 years, Dublin city has a ferry service on the Liffey. Photograph: Ronan McGreevyFor the first time in 35 years, Dublin city has a new ferry service. It was a cold, bright pre-dawn morning when the No 11 Liffey Ferry left its berth beside the MV Cill Airne at 7am for its maiden voyage as a passenger ferry. The Liffey was like glass and as the boat turned east in the direction of the Tom Clarke Bridge, a beautiful red sunrise framed the towers at Poolbeg. It was a perfect start. The only thing that was missing was passengers. There were none. “It’s a bit early,” confesses Charles Sheridan, one of the three members crew on the No 11 for its first three minute trip across the river to Sir John Rogerson’s Quay. “From a commuter point of view, the 7am start will take some time to generate traction.” He is not fazed by the lack of passengers, saying that the service will take some time to establish itself and they already have a group booked in from one of the many companies headquartered in Dublin’s Docklands. “There’s plenty of room for a viable ferry service. We are already looking at expansion plans,” he says, confidently. Fares are €2, one way, and the service will be open to Leap cards in April. The No 11 will travel between the MV Cill Airne berth on the North Quays and Sir John Rogerson’s Quay, a journey of three minutes, and from Sir John Rogerson’s Quay to the 3Arena, a journey of four minutes. The ferry will run between Monday and Friday between 7am and 7pm. Much has changed since the last ferry operated across the river in 1984. The opening of the then East Link toll bridge created another Liffey crossing for those seeking to access Dublin Port from the southside of the city. Prior to that as another crew member, Jimmy Daly, recalled one had to walk over Butt Bridge near the Custom House and all the way down to the Point Theatre (now the 3Arena) to gain access to Dublin Ports. “It was the longest walk ever,” he jokes. Even with the Samuel Beckett Bridge, which opened 10 years ago, it is still a kilometre’s walk from some parts of the south quays to the north quays. The No 11 was salvaged by Richie Saunders, formerly a coxswain in its previous incarnation as a Liffey ferry service. It was rebuilt and overhauled by Arklow Marine Services to bring it up to a commercial standard. The No 11 will be operated by the Irish Nautical Trust and all profits will be used to help fund the return of a new maritime training programme.The boat will offer young adults from the inner city and Docklands areas the opportunity to gain practical marine experience and a formal qualification accredited by the Irish Sailing Association.

Seaborne  was awarded a €15. 7m contract  to run ferries from Ramsgate  to Ostend in Belgium. The  company has no ships. Photograph: AFP An Irish shipping business that the UK government claimed pulled support from a company contracted to provide ferries in the event of a no-deal Brexit had “no contractual agreement” with the firm, a well-placed source has said.The British Department of Transport said it had decided to cancel a contract with Seaborne Freight to provide additional ferries across the English Channel to ease post-Brexit pressure on Dover after Arklow Shipping, which it described as the company’s “backer”, decided to “step back from the deal.”The awarding of the £13.8 million (€15.7 million) contract to Seaborne to run ferries from Ramsgate in England to Ostend in Belgium caused a storm of controversy when it emerged that the company had no ships and that the terms and conditions on its website appeared borrowed from a food delivery firm.The Co Wicklow firm declined to comment on the department’s statement when contacted by The . However, a source close to the firm said that while it had discussions with Seaborne about providing ships, it was never “a backer” or had “any formal agreement” with Seaborne, nor was it “a contract partner.”Arklow Shipping, a long-established shipping business owned by the Tyrell family, “stepped away” from further talks with Seaborne “for commercial reasons,” said a source with knowledge of the firm’s dealings with Seaborne.Arklow Shipping owns and operates a fleet of 55 dry bulk vessels from two bases, its home base in Co Wicklow and Rotterdam in the Netherlands.The company’s managing director James A Tyrell wrote to UK transport secretary Chris Grayling last month, saying the firm had talks with Seaborne over the previous 12 months. He said it intended to finance the purchase two vessels to operate a route between Ramsgate and Ostend and to buy a stake in Seaborne.The letter, sent by Mr Tyrell to Mr Grayling on January 18th, was published on social media on Saturday after the UK department released its statement.“I consider that Seaborne’s plans to deliver a new service to facilitate trade following from the UK’s departure from the EU are both viable and deliverable,” Mr Tyrell told the British secretary in his letter.“I will be working closely with the team at Seaborne to ensure that they have appropriate support from Arklow Shipping to deliver on their commitments to Her Majesty’s Government.”The source with knowledge of Arklow’s dealings said that it had “numerous discussions” with Seaborne but that the firm “never came to any formal agreement.”It was now “puzzled and a bit annoyed” for being blamed for the cancellation of the contract and believed the matter had been “blown out of proportion,” the source said.The company is also said to have reacted with surprise at pro-Brexit Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg questioning whether the Irish Government encouraged the Wicklow firm to withdraw its support.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said over the weekend there was “absolutely no truth” to Mr Rees-Mogg’s claim.Arklow Shipping has had no contact with the Government, said the source.The cancellation of the contract has led to calls from both Conservative and Labour MP for Mr Grayling to step down as transport secretary amid increasing concern within British business community that the UK is not prepared for a no-deal scenario with 46 days until Britain is due to leave the EU.The Conservative MP and former business minister Anna Soubry said Mr Grayling “should be quietly considering his position.”Labour MP Andy McDonald, the UK’s shadow transport secretary, called on Mr Grayling to resign. “While Theresa May needs the few friends she has right now, we cannot have this incompetent transport secretary heaping humiliation after humiliation on our country. He has to go,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire.The British Labour Party’s Brexit spokesman has warned that Theresa May is “running down the clock” towards Brexit and restated his party’s promise to put a second referendum “on the table”.Keir Starmer is in Dublin for a series of meetings with business, trade union and political leaders. He is due to meet the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney tonight.“I’m very concerned now with 46 days to go that the prime minister appears to be just running down the clock,” he told journalists at the headquarters of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.“Mindful as I am that the next EU summit is the 21st of March, and if she’s trying through chunks of two weeks to run the clock down, then I think parliament has to step in with a hard stop and say we’re not going to accept that.”The House of Commons is due to hold votes on Mrs May’s Brexit plan this week, with the prime minister due to outline her plans to MPs on Thursday.Second voteAmid reports that the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is opposed to a second referendum, Mr Starmer — seen as a champion of a “people’s vote” in Labour — said that it was Labour Party policy to keep a second referendum on the table if there is no Brexit deal and no general election.“No, it’s not off the table,” Mr Starmer said is response to questions. “The Labour Party position was set out in our conference motion in September — it said we’d vote on the deal, if the deal doesn’t go through there ought to be a general election, if there’s not a general election, options, including the option of a public vote should be on the table. So that option is on the table.“I think the options are really down to two now: first is a close economic relationship — customs union, single market alignment — the other is a public vote. So that’s where the Labour Party stands on this,” he said.Asked about reports that Mr Corbyn’s office had removed a paragraph which called for a second referendum from Labour’s letter to Mrs May last week, Mr Starmer said: “As you can imagine there’s all sorts of things go on when a letter is being drafted, I’m not going to go into the minutiae . . . The letter was an agreed letter that went out, we’ve now got a response from the prime minister, the critical question is she in her response indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not,” he said.AlignmentMr Starmer said Labour’s preference was for “the combination of customs union and single market alignment because we think that’s what’s best for the economy”.“It’s the only combination that can actually secure no hard border in Northern Ireland,” he added.He said that Mrs May should hold a vote on British membership of the customs union to see if there is a majority in the House of Commons for that option. He said that the Labour Party had “concerns” about the backstop, but accepted that there is a need for some kind of backstop.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

But nowhere is the prospect of regime change more likely than Sudan.Almost since the revolt began on December 19, rapidly spreading to towns and cities across Sudan, young medics have been at the forefront of the protests demanding Mr Bashir’s regisnation. They have also been among its most prominent victims, none more so than Babiker Abdelhamid, who was shot dead in Khartoum on January 17.Dr Babiker, who was 27, was only one of 45 people who have been killed by the security forces since the protests began, according to human rights groups. But the nature of his death, and the controversy it has ignited, has become a rallying call for the protesters, increasing rather than diminishing their determination to oust the president.According to witnesses, Dr Babiker walked out of his home, where he had been treating protesters,  and attempted to beg security officers to allow him to take the wounded to hospital. Moments later, a gunshot rang out and an hour later he was dead.“He walked down the street slowly, with his hands raised,” a colleague said. “He was trying to tell them he had critical cases and to ask them to reopen the road to Royal Care Hospital, which they had cut off. Then he was killed.Anti-government protesters rally in Khartoum, SudanFacing mounting outrage, President Bashir attempted to blame the killing on a foreign plot to bring chaos to Sudan. “The doctor who was killed… was killed by a weapon that did not belong to the army, or the NISS (National Intelligence and Security Services, or police,” he told supporters at a rally in the south of the country.“He was killed by someone among the demonstrators.”Yet there is no question that Sudan’s doctors, the most formidable group in a growing array of opponents to the regime, have borne the brunt of Mr Bashir’s increasingly violent and desperate response to the protests. At least one other doctor, Muawiya Khalil, has been killed, allegedly shot dead inside his house. Many more have been arrested, including the head of the Sudan Doctors Syndicate, his deputy and other members of the executive committee.Medics and nurses were beaten up after security forces raided two hospitals in Khartoum, firing live ammunition and teargas into the wards before dragging wounded protesters off their beds and taking them to secret detention centres. The assault on the medical profession partly reflects regime anger at doctors after they called a strike, encouraged other professions to follow suit and then threw open private hospitals to treat the wounded for free.But it is also an indication of the regime’s longstanding fear of the medical profession and the reverence with which it is held in Sudanese society.After seizing power in 1989, Mr Bashir banned independent trade unions, locked up and tortured opponents in secret prisons known as “ghost houses” and silenced dissent.But the doctors refused to be cowed, staging a strike within months of the coup — the regime responded by allegedly torturing to death one of the organisers at one of the ghost houses — and several more since.The medical profession’s opposition to the regime was driven by the distaste of secular doctors towards the coalition of Islamists and military figures that have run it and which allowed bin Laden to live in the country from 1991 to 1996. There was particular fury that Islamist militants were allowed to infiltrate a medical university in Khartoum, where students — including at least 16 Britons — were sent to join ISIL in Syria.But resentment is more deep-seated too. Sudan’s medical service was once among Africa’s most efficient. The Kitchener School of Medicine produced some of the continent’s best doctors.Tear gas is seen as Sudanese demonstrators take part in an an anti-government protest in KhartoumBut in recent decades, the health system has all but collapsed. As the Bashir regime erted government funds towards the military, slashing health expenditure to just two percent of the budget, once-functioning state hospitals became understaffed and poorly equipped. Medicines ran in short supply, free healthcare was mostly abandoned. Corrupt government officials plundered hospitals and ran dodgy procurement tenders. Unable to save lives, doctors were sometimes beaten up by the parents of children who had died in their care.Doctors’ attempts to galvanise public anger largely failed, however, with many Sudanese still too scared to confront their government. But an economic crisis in recent years, the legacy of US sanctions, lifted in 2016, and economic mismanagement in a country ranked by Transparency International as among the six most corrupt in the world, has changed the dynamic. Starved of cash, the government began printing money, sending inflation soaring to 70 percent, second only to Venezuela.Forced to adopt austerity measures, Mr Bashir lifted subsidies on basic staples, causing bread prices to treble. The rapid devaluation of the Sudanese pound had meant that the price of medicines, which are mostly imported, soaring by between 150 percent and 300 percent in the last 12 months.December’s protests began spontaneously in the city of Atbara, but they were quickly given direction and purpose by the Sudanese Professionals Organisation, an umbrella group dominated by doctors, which has marshalled near daily protests and industrial action across the country.“Demands for major healthcare changes have been repeatedly ignored over the year,” doctors’ groups said in a statement. “There has been a blatant policy of  systematically destroying the once free national health service. Our only option, coupled by our professional duty, was to escalate our protests.”The Bashir regime has thwarted previous protests, killing some 180 people during the last significant uprising in 2013. Yet Sudan observers say that, this time, the fear factor has been broken, with violence increasing rather than deterring the protesters’ determination.Other professionals have joined demands for Mr Bashir’s resignation, including professors at Khartoum University, another hallowed colonial institution that began its days as the Gordon Memorial College in 1902. Other groups, most significantly dock workers at Port Sudan, have joined the strikes.And even Sudan’s normally cautious opposition, sensing Mr Bashir’s growing vulnerability, has come out in support of the protests. Last week, Sadiq al-Mahdi, the bearded Oxford-educated former prime minister overthrown by Mr Bashir in 1989, demanded the president’s resignation.A Sudanese protester carries a portrait of President Omar al-Bashir with Arabic writing that reads \u0026#34down and that is all\u0026#34 Some observers see Mr al-Mahdi, great-grandson of Muhammad Ahmed, the Mahdi whose warriors killed General Gordon in Khartoum in 1885, as a potential candidate to head a transitional government — even though he is 83.President Bashir is not beaten yet. Middle Eastern states say they support the regime and Qatar, which has embarked on a multi-million pound development of the British-built port at Suakin, may bail him out financially. Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group, the Kremlin-linked outfit that has fought in Syria and Ukraine, have been spotted in Khartoum and are possibly assisting the regime’s repression.Yet there are rumours of splits within the regime, with even some of his generals reportedly sensing that only by sacrificing Mr Bashir will the protests, increasingly well organised and ever more determined, end.Some observers say there may be a peaceful way out, with suggestions that the president would be willing to step down if the International Criminal Court dropped its case accusing him of involvement in killing hundreds of thousands during the suppression of a rebellion in the Darfur region.Mohammed Ibrahim, a Sudanese-British billionaire and prominent critic of the Bashir regime, has led calls for the indictment to be lifted, warning that otherwise the demise of one of the Arab world’s most stubborn leaders is likely to be protracted and violent affair.“If that is going to save lives, if it is going to save us from a bloody civil war, let the man go in peace,” Mr Ibrahim told the BBC.Sign up for your essential, twice-daily briefing from The  with our free Front Page newsletter.Theresa May urges ministers to speed up NDA review after \u0026#39deeply concerning\u0026#39 allegations about Sir Philip GreenAmber Rudd admits universal credit roll-out linked to rise in food bank use Comment: My advice to the Pope?

It is the latest decades-old show to be revived, following The Generation Game, Blind Date and The Price Is Right. Last week it was announced that Bergerac is being “rebooted” after a 28-year hiatus.Crackerjack was originally hosted by Eamonn Andrews, before Leslie Crowther took over from 1960-1968. They were followed by Michael Aspel from 1968-1974 and Ed Stewart from 1975-1979.The last presenter was Stu Francis, who hosted the show until it was cancelled in 1984 and was known for the catchphrase: “Ooh, I could crush a grape!”The Krankies found fame on the show, and there were regular contributions from Bernie Clifton, Ronnie Corbett, Peter Glaze and Don Maclean.The new incarnation will be hosted by Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes, who were discovered on the singing contest Pop Idol and have since become popular children\u0027s presenters. The series will begin next year on CBBC.Ed \u0026#39Stewpot\u0026#39 Stewart and a contestant playing Double or Drop in 1979In a concession to the 21st century, the BBC said the “retro classic” will be “revitalised for today’s connected generation giving them an all-round, interactive experience while retaining the beating heart of what etched Crackerjack into the affections of British children.”In practice this will mean children sending in selfies, jokes and quiz answers via the CBBC app, rather than the post.Crackerjack will be aimed at an audience aged between six and 12. The higher end of that age group is particularly hard for broadcasters to reach.According to a study published last month by Ofcom, 49 per cent of children aged 8-11 say they prefer to watch YouTube content rather than television programmes.Francis, in a recent interview, said the show had been a hit because “it appealed to everyone. It was family time. It went out in a teatime slot and Mum and Dad used to watch it, Granny used to watch it, kids used to watch it.”A young John Bercow taking part in a 1970s edition of Crackerjack Cheryl Taylor, head of content for BBC children’s programming, said: “It’s the perfect vehicle for our much-loved stars Sam and Mark and promises to usher in a new era of frenetic family fun and whizzbang audience antics.”Graham Kibble-White, editor of TV Years magazine, said it was hard to predict whether or not the show would appeal to a modern audience.“It was a variety show with parodies of other shows, like Doctor Who. I think that could be quite a hard sell nowadays, and older kids might find it a bit naff.“But there are no new ideas all television is recycled. I don’t see why Crackerjack as a format shouldn’t work.“The funny thing is this insistence on the multimedia angle - it shows an anxiety about bringing something old back but with a feeling that they have to make it relevant.” Other new BBC children’s programmes announced yesterday include a revival of The Demon Headmaster, which was originally shown in the 1990s. The story has been updated - the headmaster is now “super-head” of an academy school.Please review our commenting policyTheresa May urges ministers to speed up NDA review after \u0026#39deeply concerning\u0026#39 allegations about Sir Philip GreenAmber Rudd admits universal credit roll-out linked to rise in food bank use Comment: My advice to the Pope?

Taken from the application which has been approvedA row has erupted in the streets of Shakespeare\u0027s birthplace as residents object to a proposed Chinese-style pavilion, which they say the council has only been approved to make the Beijing government happy.Residents in Stratford-upon-Avon say that the council has said yes to an eyesore with plans to install a 22-foot Peony Pavilion in the town centre.The structure is said to be a traditional symbol of Chinese culture and is set to be built in First Garden, which was donated to the authority by Victorian writer Marie Corelli in 1910 to preserve the open space for the benefit of the town.Some have accused the local council of refusing to reject the gift in fear of offending the Chinese government after their Chinese twin city, Fuzhou, offered the ornate structure as a sign of friendship.The gift was in response to the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust signing an agreement with the Chinese city to build replicas of the Bard\u0027s birthplace abroad.Shakespeare\u0026#39s birthplace is the biggest attraction in Stratford-upon-AvonResidents have warned that the decorative pavilion is set to cause a distraction to motorists and will lead to antisocial behaviour in a conservation area.Around 45 letters of objection were submitted on the council\u0027s planning website.One objector said: “First Gardens is a tranquil oasis. The erection of a pavilion, designed to be viewed by large numbers of visitors to the town, goes against the whole concept of this space and as it is nowhere near the other attractions in Henley Street area of town, is doomed to be an eyesore that would quickly become neglected.”Lisa Northcastle, 36, added: I can only think the council are so keen to get this sorted because they fear the consequences if they don\u0027t.I\u0027m extremely worried about a fatal car accident in the summer when it gets busy.A spokesman for the council said the structure could be in place for this year\u0027s Shakespeare Birthday Celebrations in April.District council leader Tony Jefferson said: We are extremely grateful for this gift. It is a tangible symbol of the international status of Stratford-upon-Avon.Both the UK and China have rich and distinctive cultures and by sharing our history and culture we will deepen the already strong ties.It is hoped that our cultural collaboration will continue to yield results for businesses and this growing cultural partnership will help boost trade, jobs and investment.Please review our commenting policyTheresa May urges ministers to speed up NDA review after \u0026#39deeply concerning\u0026#39 allegations about Sir Philip GreenAmber Rudd admits universal credit roll-out linked to rise in food bank use Comment: My advice to the Pope?

It was an opportunity to reward homegrown talent, certainly, but the ceremony served\u0026nbspto put the\u0026nbsppieces into place ahead of the Oscars, which takes place in just two weeks.At this year’s Baftas,\u0026nbspThe Favourite\u0026nbspled the nominations with 12\u0026nbspleaving Alfonso Cuarón’s\u0026nbspRoma\u0026nbsptrailing behind with seven – not that having the numbers on your side is any guarantee of victory on the night. However, on this occasion, it did.Below are the evening\u0027s biggest talking points.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe Favourite ruled the night, despite Roma winning Best FilmThe Baftas had dual victors when it came to the ceremony. It was a night that belonged\u0026nbspto both Yorgos Lanthimos’s historical drama, which won seven awards, and Alfonso Cuarón’s Netflix-produced drama Roma, which won four awards.\u0026nbspThe Baftas 2019 winners list in full – updating liveThe Favourite may have a Greek director in\u0026nbspLanthimos, but the period piece received significant British funding, alongside being anchored by a British story (a love triangle between Queen Anne and two confidantes) and a largely UK-hailing cast, including Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz, who won Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.\u0026nbspThe film not only won Outstanding British Film, but also won for Original Screenplay, Production Design and Make Up \u0026amp Hair. Roma, meanwhile, won the ultimate prize of the night, Best Film. Cuaron also won for Director, Cinematography and Film Not in the English Language.\u0026nbspJoanna Lumley played it (too) safeWhen Britain is currently facing one of the most turbulent political crises of recent history, it seems so faint-hearted of the ceremony to keep proceedings so… dry. Host Joanna Lumley’s monologue failed to deliver any topical gags, mostly consisting of a string of compliments and a cute joke about how The Favourite was, indeed, the night’s favourite. The only real jabs were saved for the Oscars and A Star is Born director Bradley Cooper. “Thank goodness Bafta has a host, though I suspect that has to do with the fact that I’m not on Twitter,” Lumley joked early on. Oscars organisers have confirmed that this year’s ceremony will have no official host for the first time in 30 years, after Kevin Hart stepped down when a number of old tweets resurfaced in which the comedian expressed homophobic views.Cooper, who is the star, director, producer, and screenwriter of A Star is Born, was declared by Lumley to be\u0026nbspa “multi-talented genius” who “needs to learn how to delegate”. While referencing Alfonso Cuarón’s nominations in six different categories, Lumley then turned to Cooper and added: “pull your finger out, sweetheart”.The speeches, too, were kept oddly short and free of political comment. Accepting the prize for Best Film, Cuarón\u0026nbspexpressed his gratitude for Roma winning during a time “when fear and anger would ide us” – perhaps he’s saving his most direct attacks on Trump’s policies for when he (very likely) wins at the upcoming Academy Awards. Andy Serkis made a quick reference while presenting the prize for Original Music, noting that: “Music is like Laurel without Hardy, Queen without Freddie Mercury - it\u0027s Britain without Europe”.\u0026nbspThe most controversial comment of the evening by far was made by presenter Eddie Marsan. While presenting the award for Best Costume Design with Cynthia Erivo, the actor described the difficulty of creating historically accurate costumes for films. He then added that it was particularly difficult to do since Britain had “reinvented its past to justify Brexit”. Perhaps the winners simply had no time, with such truncated speeches, to make their political case.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Baftas 2019: Best dressed guests on the red carpet Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The British actor looks chic in a white tuxedo by Stella McCartney on the red carpet.

Mahershala Ali beat Richard E Grant, the expected winner, to Best Supporting Actor, winning for his role as jazz musician Don Shirley in Green Book. Rami Malek, meanwhile, cemented himself as the favourite when it comes to the Academy Awards, winning Best Actor for his role as Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody. Thanking Dexter Fletcher, who stepped in as director when Bryan Singer was fired from the project, Malek said: “Thank you so much to Queen and to greatest outsider of them all, for being so unwavering and unflinching and uncompromising in every which way – thank you again, Freddie Mercury.”Letitia Wright proves the power of Marvel\u0026nbspLetitia Wright’s win for the publicly voted Rising Star Award proved that Marvel will always have its sway when it comes to the average cinemagoer. Although she’s proven herself time and time again in her performances – from Black Mirror to Young Vic’s staging of The Convert – it’s her role as Black Panther’s fan favourite character, inventor Shuri, that ultimately won her prize. In her speech, she said: “I identify myself as a child of God and I can’t get up here without thanking God. A few years ago, I saw myself in a deep state of depression and I literally wanted to quit acting.” She then credited God for helping her through this period, alongside an e-mail from Bafta asking her to take part in its Breakthrough Brits programme. “So this wasn’t an overnight thing. This wasn’t a click of the finger success. I’m still a work in progress,” she added. “I want to thank everybody that said yes to me.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The hunt for such alternatives inevitably leads to examples of other borders and it is usually only a matter of time before someone volunteers the Switzerland-France border as a model. Switzerland is in Schengen (so no need for passport checks) and regulations on goods are broadly aligned with those of the EU. Switzerland is not in the EU’s customs union nor its VAT regime, and that means border checks are required. Its watches and cuckoo clocks literally run like clockwork, so, the argument goes, must its borders.But it’s not as simple as that. As the Swiss Federal Customs Administration makes clear, even though they have the latest technology and much paperwork is done away from the border, there is still some physical infrastructure and delays of up to four hours if a lorry is searched.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 2018 Switzerland launched a new IT-based customs transformation programme. This programme aims to simplify, harmonise and fully digitise customs tax and duty collection processes. It should be in place by 2026.However, this programme will not make controls at the border redundant. Quite the opposite. Because routine administrative work and bureaucratic procedures will be replaced by IT-based solutions, personnel will be freed up. These people will be used to strengthen security, especially for control functions and reinforcement of criminal prosecution. Some of these functions will continue to apply at the border. Hence, even with a highly technologically advanced customs management system, controls at the border will not become obsolete and nor will customs infrastructure vanish.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

Norway is not in the customs union either, so the origin of goods must be checked. Again, Norwegian Customs make clear what is required. Although it is technologically advanced, there is still a delay. The average time from when a lorry arrives at the border to when it leaves is about 20 minutes. This includes roughly ten minutes waiting time, three to six minutes of handling time, and the time spent coming off the road to complete the customs process. And there’s physical infrastructure too. All this despite existing agreements on customs facilitation, transit and rules of origin between the EU and the European Free Trade Association states, of which Norway is one.Less often talked about are Andorra and San Marino. Both are small European nations that are in a customs union with the EU. Although Andorra’s treaty only covers goods, its borders with Spain and France are strictly controlled. This is due to the fact that Andorra has no VAT (yet) and is known as low tax territory. Thus, smuggling has always been a concern of the neighbouring countries. The customs union with San Marino covers all goods except coal and steel. It has traditionally kept an open border without checks at its frontier with Italy. However, it levies an import tax, at 17 per cent.The Bulgaria-Turkey border is worse. Turkey is in a customs union with the EU, which removes tariffs and quantitative restrictions in bilateral trade between EU member states and Turkey for the goods covered. It also sets a single external tariff for both the EU and Turkey, so they charge the same duties on imports from non-EU countries.Unlike the customs union covering EU member states, the EU-Turkey agreement is incomplete. It covers industrial goods but not agricultural products (except certain processed agricultural products), coal and steel products, or public procurement.Finally, the border between Turkey and the EU is bureaucratic and lengthy. Lorry drivers need an export declaration, a customs permit, invoices for the products they are transporting, insurance certificates and a transport permit for each EU nation they will drive through. The queues at the border can be up to 17 kilometres long and the wait as much as 30 hours. While Turkey has invested significantly in modernising its border, with checks taking place an hour inland, Bulgarian officials check the paperwork for every truck and x-ray all refrigerated lorries.Which brings us to the US-Canada border. Again, much resource has been put into streamlining this border but there are still delays - the length can be seen online. All of this indicates that regardless of the technological capabilities of the EU’s neighbouring countries, there will be checks and the borders and this means infrastructure.By Professor Catherine Barnard, senior fellow The UK in a Changing Europe and Dr Georges Baur.

And that Bank of England forecast assumes a smooth Brexit rather than a rupture at the end of March.The view of most economists is that the economic damage of Brexit is indeed already being done – and it is hurting the UK even if we end up avoiding a no-deal disaster later this month.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

What began as a startup is now one of London’s leading destinations for yoga and\u0026nbsppilates, with five studios across the capital and more than 750 classes per week.Created with Sketch.Yoga Inc. The phenomenal popularity of yoga Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sattin had no initial plans to work in the wellbeing industry. “My father was a doctor and really wanted one of his three sons to follow in his footsteps,” he says.“For years, I thought that’s what I was going to do too. But I ended up going to law school and eventually became a lawyer, setting up my own practice when I was 27.”Looking for a better way to relax while studying, Sattin taught himself to meditate and the seeds for an altogether different life were sewn – not that he knew it at the time. In 1985, one of his colleagues who thought he was a little “left of centre” suggested he try yoga and sent Sattin to a private class in northwest London. The experience turned out to be life-changing.Sattin says: “It might sound clichéd but it’s one of these experiences that become more profound when you look back at them. At the time, I just realised instantly that I needed to change.“I was a heavy smoker, I used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and a drink about 14 cups of coffee with two sugars each. Within three months of practising I quit all of that.” “It wasn’t that I suddenly gave up practising law, shaved my head and wore orange robes, but it was a catalyst for change. It encouraged me to do better.”After 18 years of practising law he decided he had enough in 1996. Sattin agreed to a year’s notice, which gave him time to think about his next steps. He says: “I was involved in the set up of Yo! Sushi and Protocol Multimedia Talent Agency. I was talking to some friends in Los Angeles, who said, ‘Why don’t you do what you love?’ and I realised yoga was what I was the most interested in.” He travelled to the US to see how studios like YogaWorks in Los Angeles and Jivamukti yoga in New York operated. “The aim was to see what they were doing wrong and what I could learn from their mistakes,” Sattin says.“Once I got the concept, I was very passionate about doing it and when you have that passion, people want you to succeed,” he adds.Sattin used his network to fund the company and managed to raise £500,000. In 2000, with the help of a company board, some of whose members he found while walking his golden retriever in Regent’s Park, the first Triyoga studio in Primrose Hill was born.Early investors included David Svendsen, who was then chair\u0026nbspof Microsoft, while Simon Low joined the company to be director of yoga, a role he kept until 2002.If you are a little shy about stepping inside this impressive mecca for yogis, you shouldn’t be. The whole concept was to create a place for all.Sattin says: “From the beginning, the idea was to create a place where anyone could practice yoga. It had to be authentic and we also wanted to have a wide range of classes. I knew from my own experience that people want different things at different times. The number of people who attend Triyoga classes each year“Sometimes you might want something dynamic and sometimes you might want something restorative. We wanted to help our customers to find the type of practice that was appropriate for them.” With its proximity to the London homes of Sadie Frost and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have both attended classes there, the Primrose Hill centre quickly become a byword for glamour – an image that Sattin is visibly uncomfortable with.He says: “When we first opened, our studio Primrose Hill wasn’t quite as cool and glamorous as it is now. It had the feeling of a village and it was quite awkward to get there. It was interesting as an area. We never sought to attract celebrities, our aim was to give time and space to practice to anyone that comes through our doors.”For the\u0026nbspfirst full year, the company’s turnover was £393,000, and in 2017 this jumped to an impressive £6.2m.\u0026nbspMore than 600,000 people attend Triyoga classes every year and in 2015 it opened a\u0026nbspteacher-training academy.A branch opened in Covent Garden in 2003, followed by Soho in 2005, and another two studios in Shoreditch and Ealing opened their doors in 2017.Of course, there were also some obstacles. Triyoga was forced out of its coveted location in Primrose Hill after losing a three-year battle against a development firm. Fortunately, Sattin promptly found an alternative venue in Camden in an old piano factory in Jamestown Road – a short walk away from its original location.Each studio now has a café and a shop. The company also offers teacher training, retreats and holidays. Sattin says: “As we’ve expanded, we’ve tried to get better, and improve our service and our offering. We always had changing rooms and showers – which was quite unusual at the time. But we’ve added cafés, shops and more treatments.“Essentially, we wanted our customers to have a comfy space where they wanted to stay and hangout. We wanted them to feel like they were part of something.” The market has changed considerably since Triyoga first opened its doors nearly 20 years ago. Competition might be more brutal than ever – but Sattin says the quality of the teaching at Triyoga is what makes them different from rivals.He says: “We are passionate with the quality of our teaching and our treatments. We now have 122 teachers, not including those who come for guest’s lessons.“We look at how qualified they are, but also if they teach the way that is right for us. As a basic rule our teachers need to have a minimum of five years’ experience. Each one goes through a thorough interview process and also teaches a class to the team and to our clients.”The company may not have embraced goat yoga, but it has been quick to evolve with the times – last year, Triyoga spearheaded an initiative for Consent Cards, the first of its kind, in response to the #MeToo movement. Sattin explains: “In yoga, some of our students may wish to be corrected, but others just prefer not to be touched. “These allow all students to put a card on their mat, so if they don’t want to be adjusted, the teacher knows without them having to say anything.”The company hosts a triyoga podcast, which Sattin says is all about confronting issues in the wellness world head-on. This include debates about yoga practices in a #MeToo era and the complex relationship between contemporary yoga and eating disorders.Perhaps it is down to the calming effect of yoga, but Sattin is refreshingly humble when talking about the centre’s success. When asked about oversea expansion plans, he says: “We don’t have plans to expand outside of the UK for now. I want to keep our values and continue investing in the right people, look at how we can improve our service and provide even better care for our clients.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The group was said to be unhappy about its treatment during the bidding process, according to the Financial Times, which reported that Mike Ashley’s firm had “not been allowed access to a data room, any financial information or meetings with management”, leaving the company “at a serious disadvantage as a bidder”. The administrators told Sports Direct it would need to increase its bid by as much as £2m, which the company said it was “not able to match” without having access to “any due diligence, financial information or management meetings”.

However, consumer confidence has started to come under pressure with British households £1,500 worse off on average than was forecast before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.Households had been supplementing meagre earnings growth by increasing their levels of debt, but consumer credit growth dropped in December.The Bank of England reported\u0026nbspthe annual growth of unsecured lending in the month fell to 6.6 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November.This was the weakest figure since December 2014. Credit card lending growth slowed to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent the previous month.A number of economists precisted the slowdown would continue into 2019 unless the government could deliver a degree of certainty about\u0026nbspthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Brexit ucertainty and slowing global growth were “suffocating” economic\u0026nbspactivity.\u0026nbspHe added: “The continued decline in business investment is a blackspot for the economy as it undermines the UK’s ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects.“It is increasingly likely that the slowdown at the end of 2018 will persist as continued Brexit uncertainty and the raised possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU weigh heavily on UK’s growth prospects. Firms are increasingly reporting having to ert staff, money and investment to protect against the chaos of a no-deal Brexit.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist\u0026nbspat Capital Economics, said the ONS figures support the more downbeat view given by the Bank of England last week.“But they also suggest there is plenty of scope for the economy to bounce back once the Brexit uncertainty is removed,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Come at me, says David BarnettClick to followThe IndependentOasis’s London debut at the Water Rats, January 1994There will be those who have just read the headline and already gone directly to the comments to take issue. For any waverers, I’ll set out my stall again: 1994 was the best year in music. Possibly ever.\u0026nbspStill here? Right, we happy few, let’s unpack this a little. Putting the words “best” and “music” together is always going to be subjective. One woman’s Metallica is another man’s Joe Dolce. And there’s also time and place to take into account. If you were six years old in 1994, you might not have been bothered about contemporary pop. If you were 76, maybe ditto. But there are certain immutable, irrefutable truths, and this is one of them. The year 1994 was spectacular for music on so, so many levels.Perhaps a bit of wider context is needed. To live through 1994 as a relatively young person (I turned 24 in the January) was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UK.That was the year the IRA ceasefire was signed, and 911 was still seven years away, and not on on our radar at all. After the breakup of the Soviet Union three years earlier, Russia was more interested in implementing democracy and capitalism than fighting a Cold War. It felt like the dawn of an age – sadly short-lived – when nobody was trying to blow us up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIn 1994, Bill Clinton was in the White House, and still a year away from staining his character (and a dress) by not having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. Neil Kinnock’s Labour had somehow lost the 1992 general election, despite everyone being confident the Tory stranglehold was finally over, but in 1994 Labour named Tony Blair as leader of the party, and things...\u0026nbspwell, things could only get better.To live through 1994 as a relatively young person ... was to be at the centre of what felt like a time of transcendent change in the UKAfter what seemed like years of stagnation, there was a whiff of change in the air. Things felt in some way more optimistic. The country felt more inclusive, less isive. There was opportunity, and expectation. It was the year they launched the National Lottery. Any one of us could become a multimillionaire by buying a ticket for a quid.And music reflected this, as it always reflects the world around it. There was a sensation of rapid, almost out-of-control evolution in music. People’s record collections became more eclectic, more wide-ranging, more small-c catholic. The old boundaries seemed to melt away. You didn’t need to choose between being a rocker or a raver or an indie-kid or a popster. You could be all of them at once, because if the bands and artists were refusing to stay in their pigeonholes, why should the public?Why we haven’t had a decent Christmas song since 1994Slap bang in the middle of the year, at the Glastonbury Festival at the end of June, I stood in a field and had a transformative experience watching the progressive techno band Orbital playing a set to what felt like half the people in the world. They had come to Glastonbury to see Oasis, or Rage Against the Machine they had come for Björk and James. They had come to listen to Nick Cave, to jump around to Blur, to dance to M People. And in the end, they all came to watch Orbital playing their bleepy, unnerving, bass-pounding music of the spheres, and for what felt like the first time ever the tribes were all united in the love of music.Of course, that could just be the drugs talking. But look at that Glastonbury line-up! Just one year, one scorching hot June weekend! And you can add to that list St Etienne, Paul Weller, Pulp, Spirtualised, Radiohead...\u0026nbsppossibly the best Glastonbury ever, in the year of the best music ever?That coming together at the Orbital set heralded a sea change for Glastonbury. According to Sheryl Garratt’s excellent book detailing the rise of rave culture, Adventures in Wonderland, Glasto organiser Michael Eavis had previously shied away from having a dance stage because of the negative connotations attached to rave and techno – primarily the drugs, illegal events and mass takeovers at places like Castlemorton two years previously.She wrote: “But after Orbital’s live set stole the show in 1994, a dance stage and dance tents were finally introduced the following year, and Glastonbury has become an annual event on the club calendar.”If I had to fight with myself over this bold claim for 1994 to be music’s finest year, I’d probably employ maybe 1988 as my weapon of choice. That was really the start of rave culture, and where dance music began to cross over with guitar bands, resulting in the baggy Madchester sound epitomised by the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, James and\u0026nbspthe Inspiral Carpets.But while that might have been where the seeds of fusion of the genres and inclusivity were sown, I’d argue that it wasn’t until 1994 that those ideas and concepts properly blossomed. And, of course, 1994 was the year of Britpop.It was actually in 1993 that Britpop got going, thanks to a feature in the now defunct music magazine Select. Grunge, with its poster boys Nirvana and their lead singer Kurt Cobain (more of whom anon) had held sway with its nihilistic, fuzzy guitars in Britain for a couple of years among an army of plaid-wearing, chain-smoking disaffected youth. But Select wanted to wave the flag for Blighty, quite literally as that month’s issue featured on its cover Suede’s Brett Anderson against a union jack background and an article\u0026nbspinside headlined, “Who Do You Think You Are Kidding, Mr Cobain?”. Denim, Pulp, Suede, The Auteurs and St Etienne were all featured, in a bid to push British pop back up the agenda.By 1994, two seminal Britpop albums went head to head – as did the bands responsible for them. Oasis released their debut Definitely Maybe, while Blur brought out their third LP, Parklife. Oasis v Blur bubbled under throughout the year, battle lines drawn at the Watford Gap. It was the naughty north vs the sexy south, Manchester’s Oasis and their Beatlesque anthems set against Blur’s cheeky chappy Camden Kinks roisterers. By the following year, the so-called rivalry even made the BBC evening news as the two bands released singles on the same day.If there ever was any proper animosity between Oasis and Blur, it didn’t extend to the fans. Blur or Oasis might have been a perennial pub debate throughout 1994, but I don’t think I knew anyone who didn’t own both Definitely Maybe and Parklife. The rivalry added a bit of spice, and music fans were the winners with two defining albums of the decade.Britpop wasn’t only about Blur and Oasis, of course, though as the cocky lads in the class they tended to get most of the attention. But let us consider some of the other releases that came under the red-white-and-blue Britpop banner:\u0026nbspPulp’s His ’n’\u0026nbspHers, considered to be the album that brought them to mainstream attention, especially for the standout tracks “Do You Remember the First Time?” and “Babies”\u0026nbspEchobelly’s debut Everyone’s Got One, with its spiky, caustic, feminist songs Suede’s second album Dog Man Star, which perhaps exemplified how bands were not afraid to evolve and transform in 1994. Suede’s first album was almost a paean to Bowie with a side order of The Smiths here they’d gone much more personal and perhaps introspective.Another band that completely reinvented itself in 1994 was Primal Scream. Never a band to stick with one musical style, they had, however, found a niche in the dance-rock mash-ups of 1991’s Screamadelica. When they returned in ’94 with Give Out But Don’t Give Up, it could not have been further from the blissed-out rhythms of “Loaded” and “Higher Than the Sun”. The Scream had gone full-on Rolling Stones blues, and the\u0026nbspfirst single from the album, “Rocks”, was the band’s highest-charting release.Had 1994 given us only Britpop, the year would still have deserved a place in posterity. But it was about so much more than that. Select magazine might have jokingly tried to drive America back into the sea the previous year, but US bands released some absolutely classic albums that year.What about Green Day’s Dookie, and its single “Basket Case”? By 1994, REM were stone-cold alt-rock royalty, and while their ninth studio album Monster might not be in everyone’s top five REM albums, it did at least give us the single “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”. Weezer released their self-titled debut, and Beck gave us the unalloyed eclectic joy of Mellow Gold and the single “Loser”.But the most influential American band of the era, Nirvana, came to a tragic end when, in April,\u0026nbspleader Kurt Cobain wrote a note to his imaginary childhood friend and then put a shotgun to his chin and pulled the trigger. He had gone and joined that stupid club, the one where the most talented musicians of a generation end their own lives at the age of 27. Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison. The year\u0026nbsphad its martyr.This was also the year that music fans who’d previously filled their CD racks with white boys playing guitars began to embrace rap and hip-hop\u0026nbsp– and also when hip-hop transformed, Kafka-like, into something quite new.Then Notorious BIG\u0026nbspreleased his debut Ready to Die, and indeed he did, becoming the martyr of 1997 a few years later. Public Enemy brought out their highly acclaimed fifth studio album, Muse Sick-n-Hour Mess Age, and the Beastie Boys fused hip hop with the greatest 1970s police detective show that never was with the video to their single “Sabotage”.In Britain, this acceptance of rap into the music collections of the largely white indie-kid audience led to the birth of something else we can thank 1994 for: trip-hop.The term was coined that year by a Mixmag journalist to describe the bass-heavy fusion of hip-hop and dance music that was largely coming out of Bristol. Massive Attack had already released the seminal Blue Lines album and the evergreen “Unfinished Sympathy” in 1991, but this year saw their second album Protection, and its standout single release “Karmacoma”. But the year was most notable for Portishead’s debut, Dummy, drenched in blue and heartbreak, and the soundtrack to a thousand all-back-to-mine post-club chillouts.What else? Well, we could still get away with forgiving Morrissey a lot back in 1994, especially with his fourth solo album Vauxhall and I. The Manic Street Preachers released The Holy Bible, the last work to feature troubled lyricist and guitarist Richey Edwards. The following year he would go missing, never to be found, making a martyr of a more introspective kind than Cobain’s dramatic exit. The old-stagers were keeping on keeping on, with albums from Madonna and the Rolling Stones, and even a wealth of previously unheard Beatles material from their sessions at the BBC.But if there was one comeback that exemplified 1994, it had to be The Stone Roses. Their self-titled debut album in 1989 soundtracked a generation. Their return five years later had a lot riding on it in terms of expectations. So, of course, they titled it The Second Coming.Bill Gates basically predicted rise of Netflix and Facebook in 1994Read this full unedited Tom Petty interview published in 1994Was it ever going to be as good as The Stone Roses? No, of course not, because that album was perfection. But with singles such as “Love Spreads” and “Ten Storey Love Song”, they made a pretty good fist of it. But it was an event, it was exciting, it was history-making. And it was brave and reckless and so typically Stone Roses\u0026nbspto release their first new album for years when everyone had all but written them off, and especially to do that in the greatest year for music ever.Without the benefit of the internet or smartphones, we discovered new music in 1994, we heard it in the pubs and at gigs and in clubs and festivals and on John Peel’s radio show. We bought indie music then we went to Creamfields or to superclubs in places like Leeds, and danced until dawn.Techno got hard and heavy. The aforementioned Orbital released Snivilisation, a growling, science-fiction nightmare of an album. The government tried to kill off rave culture good and proper with the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which drove people into the clubs but also earned a response from the Prodigy in the form of Music for the Jilted Generation, a howling, psychopathic protest album that gifted us the insane energy of “No Good (Start the Dance)” and “Voodoo People”. The Chemical Brothers, under the name the Dust Brothers, started releasing singles. Dance music became raw and scary, a self-fulfilling prophecy for those in positions of authority that thought they simply had to ban it.Music in 1994 was a erse mess, just like it always is. But it seemed as if there was an invisible thread running through all these genres\u0026nbspthat connected people through a general love of music. You might love Oasis more than the Prodigy, or Blur more than Portishead, but the chances are you listened to all of it. The year was about invention, about reinvention, about throwing open the doors and just trying everything. It was involving and inclusive and seems to shine so very brightly from the vantage point of today.\u0026nbspThe obvious answer to all this is that I am just old and clinging on to a year that seemed glorious just because I was there. But I insist: 1994 was the best year ever for music, and its spirit is something we could sorely do with today.

It opposes the extremism of no-deal but is not prepared to support ‘no Brexit’. Its position is for soft Brexit, triangulating between the instruction to Leave and the economic concerns of those who voted to Remain.That means a permanent customs union, alignment with the single market, and compromise on freedom of movement. Jeremy Corbyn’s letter to the prime minister of 6th February set out Labour’s Brexit plan clearly and coherently. What is distinctive about Labour’s plan for Brexit is that it honours the vote to leave while maintaining a close partnership with the EU such that it is capable of securing the consent of those who voted to stay. It has more than fulfilled its responsibility as the Opposition. \u0026nbspThe Labour plan appears to be based on the IPPR paper ‘the Shared Market’, first published in December 2017, which I co-authored. In fact, its first outing was not to the Labour leadership but to David Davis and Steve Baker at the Department for Exiting the European Union.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe report introduced the idea that the crucial strategic decision was not about securing ‘access’ to the single market but rather whether there would be regulatory alignment or regulatory ergence. The report examined the various options for a new partnership, identifying a future relationship that could satisfy the concerns of both sides of the ide (and was briefly considered by senior cabinet figures).Labour’s position has, in fact, been much more defined for longer than is commonly imagined.It was in February last year that the Labour Leader adopted the central idea of “a new and comprehensive customs union” that would be permanent. A few months later a frontbench Labour amendment adopted another key component: alignment to the single market, based on shared institutions, such as a UK Court of Justice with multilateral membership.The Corbyn letter codified other elements too, including dynamic alignment on workers’ and consumer rights and environmental protections (meaning that regulations would adjust in the UK to match improvements in the single market over time). Mindful of the sovereignty concerns of Leave supporters, the report also argued that there must remain the possibility of ergence, albeit with known and proportionate consequences thus eliminating any ‘cakeism’.The Labour plan was infused with political life by positive reactions in Westminster and Brussels. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said it could be a way to break the impasse. Senior Conservative backbenchers said that they would support key elements of the proposal.So we now know that there is a deal available that is acceptable to the EU and that could almost certainly command majority support in the House of Commons. But its passage would come at the price of splitting the Tory Party down the middle, on a scale and severity akin to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 (another dispute about international trade).Yet Mrs May has chosen to reject Labour’s proposal, placing the unity of the Conservative Party above the opportunity to unify the country with a form of Brexit that would have honoured the referendum result while protecting the economy.Labour strategists believe that attempting to stop Brexit would destroy the party’s chances of winning the next general election. They point out that the vast majority of Labour-Tory marginals voted to Leave, and that it is vital for the party to win these seats if it is to create an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons. They believe that these voters would punish them for advocating for, let alone forcing, a second referendum. Some go further still, arguing that Labour would inevitably lead the Remain campaign\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspand that Leave would win once again, thus destroying the leadership of\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn.\u0026nbspThose representing working class constituencies in the north of England have vocally made the case that attempting to reverse Brexit would be a betrayal of Labour’s working class supporters. The reality is that for many of Labour’s working class supporters, Brexit is not particularly important, compared to the impact of austerity and stagnating living standards. This makes sense: any voter for whom leaving the EU was a top issue would be unlikely to support Labour anyhow.Nonetheless, the nostalgic, romantic idea of championing the working classes has strong emotional resonance at the top of the party. Shadow ministers such as Ian Lavery, Richard Burgon, Jon Trickett, and Andrew Gwynne are reported to have threatened to resign rather than to vote in favour of a second referendum. So for the Labour leadership so far, a second referendum has been a paper option, not a serious way forward.Moreover, this electoral strategy chimes with the long-held ideological position of key decision makers, many of whom have been opposed to the EU for decades. It is variously seen as an undemocratic, neoliberal institution, asserting neo-colonial control over its weaker members, and as an instrument of NATO. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn opposes Tory Brexit, but does not oppose Brexit itself.From this standpoint, accepting the result of the referendum is not sacrificing the national interest to the party interest they are inisible. Confirmation bias is surely at play: the electoral strategy that is seen as most promising is also the one that confirms the pre-existing ideological position.Created with Sketch.

This was illustrated by the absence of consequences for those Labour MPs that rebelled on the Cooper-Boles amendment to legislate to prevent no-deal.This strategy stands a reasonable chance of success: the real die-hards in the Conservative Party that oppose any deal number perhaps 30 MPs should roughly 15 Labour MPs support the government and roughly 30 abstain, then the deal will pass. But is this really smart politics? Or a high stakes gamble based on flawed assumptions?First, the strategy is based on the assumption that British politics will ‘move on’ from Brexit after the deal is approved by parliament and refocus on domestic policy instead. Labour wisely realises that politics is not about two competing answers to the same question but what question is being answered in the first place: if Brexit is the question of a general election, then the Tories will be the answer.But if the election is about the state of the country, Labour believes it is poised to win. At the 2017 general election, many voters appeared to think that Brexit and immigration had been ‘dealt with’ and the national conversation shifted to stagnant wages, increasing class sizes and longer waiting times in the NHS.In the Brexit poker game no one has a decent handBut this is wishful thinking. Brexit won’t disappear as a political issue: come the end of 2020, parliament will need to either ratify a FTA with the EU, extend the transition at the cost of £11byear, or enter the hated backstop. The most likely outcome is a transition that extend to April 2022, the month prior to the general election in May 2022. That feels like an eternity away—and in political terms it is. If the Brexit project succeeds—or more accurately, it does not catastrophically fail—the government will reap the political benefits. But if it fails, expect the blame to be spread liberally around. Neither is it wise to assume opinion will remain static. The longer the Brexit shambles persists, the higher the chance that Labour votes shift from disquiet to disillusion with their leader’s seeming ambivalence. \u0026nbspSecond, the strategy assumes that the next general election will be determined by swing voters in marginal seats. This approach privileges the views of Labour and Tory Leave supporters rather than Remainers. But it is hard to picture Tory-voting Leave supporters switching to Labour under Corbyn’s leadership, not least because these voters are more likely to be concerned about issues such as national security which are traditional ‘owned’ by the Conservatives. It is hard to believe that the same people who can energise the left with a clear socialist message can also persuade Brexit supporting Tory voters to switch allegiances. More than that, as New Labour discovered to its peril, it is dangerous to take your own supporters for granted.But what if the election isn’t determined by swing voters at all?One of the important consequences of the 2016 referendum was to ide the country in two blocs that have coalesced into competing identities as well as political positions. Is the UK perhaps becoming a 50-50 nation? This is the phenomenon seen in the US since the 1990s – where the country is split into two competing cultural and geographic blocs – and may provide some explanation for the resurgence in support for the two major parties in the 2017 general election.In such a scenario, what matters is not swing voters but energising your base to get out and vote – and not sufficiently riling your opponents’ supporters so they feel the need to stop you (witness Labour’s commitment to the pensions triple lock in 2017, for example).\u0026nbspLabour strategists have argued that Remainers have nowhere else to go, and that if there was really popular support for a stop Brexit party, then the Liberal Democrats would have been beneficiaries by now. The mooted “Neoliberal Democrat”\u0026nbspparty that is likely to be formed by a small number of Labour MPs splitting to join with the Lib Dems will attract copious media coverage, but has next to no constituency in the country.But this is to miss the point: the real risk for Labour is not that its Remain voters support other parties, but that they simply stay at home and don’t vote for anyone. So if the next general election is determined by turnout rather than by swing voters, Labour could be in serious trouble. Labour is betting that these voters are to be found in city seats with already large majorities, and so the impact would be negligible. But what if they are in marginals, in places like Kensington or Canterbury?Team Corbyn believe that their base is not energised by EU membership, but by ending austerity, investing in public services, and promoting economic justice. That is certainly true for vocal Labour supporters for whom the project is about socialism, not the details of the UK’s relationship with the single market or European institutions.Brexit: How austerity convinced residents to vote LeaveBut for other middle-class voters – insulated from the severest impacts of austerity but for whom the EU is an important identity issue – there is a risk that this is not the case. And Labour’s ask to the middle classes for more redistribution means that motivation really matters in getting them out to vote. Labour may discover\u0026nbspvoters find it rather easy to stay at home when asked to vote for higher taxes on themselves. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThird, Labour’s triangulated position risks undermining one of the most important dimensions of Corbyn’s popular appeal. Despite being in parliament for more than 30 years, Corbyn was able to position Labour as the party of change precisely because he was rightly perceived to be an outsider, and unlike career politicians. The message of his leadership campaign – “straight talking, honest politics” – was the same positioning used in the 2017 general election.But by triangulating on Brexit, Corbyn runs the risk of being seen to be just like any other politician. This probably explains the decline in his approval ratings to historic lows—indeed, Corbyn might be better perceived if he simply picked a side, whether that was Leave or Remain.The shift in perception of Corbyn towards being seen as any other politician will make it much harder for Labour to be seen as the party that can bring about the change Britain needs at the next general election, particularly since the Tories will have elected a new leader by that time. Again, this risks turnout of Labour voters rather than affecting swing voters. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhat’s the alternative?The only way out our Brexit malaise? Labour winning a general electionThe alternative for Labour is to stick to the spirit as well as the letter of its Brexit policy agreed at its party conference in September. That would mean continuing to oppose May’s Brexit deal as bad for the country and for no-deal to be taken off the table. If Labour’s Brexit plan is rejected by parliament, then the party should fight for the people to be given the final say. \u0026nbspIt must mobilise its 500,000 members to campaign for the people to be given the final say on the deal—whether to keep the deal we already have as members (in the EU but out of the euro and Schengen) or to embrace the deal proposed by the prime minister. If the prime minister believes so strongly in her deal, why not put it to the people?If Labour MPs are presented with a choice between May’s Withdrawal Agreement—including its hard Brexit destination for the future relationship—and a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister will win the vote. The prime minister knows this and the public do too.As it stands, Labour is already seen by a majority of the public as the “party of Remain”. Brexit was always a project of the right and it is now rightly owned by the Tory party. Given this, voters might well reward the party for a clear, forceful, and unambiguous position – regardless of whether the parliamentary numbers for a further referendum materialise or not. Labour does not have the votes in parliament to end austerity, but that has not stopped it from campaigning against it. Why should Brexit be different? A public vote can only happen if it commands cross-party support, so if Labour is unable to force it to happen, it will not shoulder the responsibility. But if it doesn’t even try, then it will surely share in the public’s opprobrium.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentIn many respects, Labour is in the classic dilemma of strategy under uncertainty. For all the claims and counterclaims of each side, the truth is that no one can be sure, not least because Labour possesses the capacity to shape events as well as respond to them. The polling evidence is mixed and often contradictory—a majority of the public don’t want a second referendum but then again Labour support also appears to suffer significantly if the party is seen to back Brexit.No one should pretend Labour faces an easy path ahead. But situations of extreme uncertainty also have their blessings: if the politically shrewd course is unclear, then all the more reason to simply do the right thing for the future prosperity and security of the country, and oppose Brexit. \u0026nbspLeaving the EU is bad for Britain it is a project of the radical right that has been revealed to have been both deceitful and empty at the same time. Labour should oppose it.Centuries of foreign policy sought to prevent the European continent uniting against this country through our own volition, the UK has finally brought about precisely the outcome it has always sought to avoid.Since its creation, the United Kingdom has been torn between wishing to engage in European affairs and to retreat to its shores, and Brexit must be understood in that context. So it is a very serious mistake to believe that there can be political stability outside the EU: no equilibrium position can be reached precisely because the UK economy will continue to be shaped by decisions made in Brussels. No matter the deal, Brexit means the UK giving up its participation in decision-making and losing the very control the referendum sought to restore.That’s why, in time, the UK will re-join, albeit on less favourable terms than we enjoy today. And so the left of British politics will surely search for internationalist leadership in the decade ahead. No matter how much the public demand “just get on with it”, the Europe question is here to stay.\u0026nbspLabour must fight for Britain to shape our future for the better, as full members of the European Union.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspTom Kibasi writes in a personal capacity.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The “dramatic” fall suggest none will be left in 100 years, warned Francisco Sanchez-Bayo, of the University of Sydney’s School of Life and Environmental Sciences.“The rate of decline is really huge,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.How climate change could cause mass extinction of animalsHundreds more species under threat than previously thoughtButterflies and moths are among the worst affected, along with bees and dung beetles. Researchers said “a considerable proportion” of aquatic fly species had also been lost already.The review highlighted four key drivers of extinction: habitat loss caused by\u0026nbspagriculture, urbanisation and deforestation pollution biological factors such as invasive species and diseases and climate change.Agriculture was the “main culprit” in 40 per cent of the studies reviewed, with researchers highlighting “the way we apply pesticides” as a particular threat.“We have been doing agriculture for thousands of years and we have never seen these declines,” said Dr Sanchez-Bayo. “The introduction of systemic insecticides has been in a big change in the way we do agriculture these days.”The review, published in the journal Biological Conservation, said: “Unless we change our ways of producing food, insects as a whole will go down the path of extinction in a few decades.“The repercussions this will have for the planet’s ecosystems are catastrophic to say the least.”Researchers added dwindling insect populations were further evidence of\u0026nbspa sixth mass extinction\u0026nbspunderway among animal and plant species worldwide.A study published\u0026nbspby researchers at Aarhus and\u0026nbspGothenbury universities\u0026nbsplast year warned mankind was killing off species so rapidly that evolution was unable to fill in the gaps.\u0026nbspUniversity of SydneyUniversity of QueenslandOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

You can’t really run in it, it’ll literally fly off. The pins come out and it falls off – it’s not comfortable.“Wearing the sports hijab makes it ten times easier, and I genuinely think it’s a lifesaver.”Some sports giants already have their own hijabs on the market, however at £15 Brunel’s is about 40 per cent cheaper than the one Nike launched in 2017.The hijab will initially only be available in “Brunel blue” and in two sizes but it is hoped there will be a wider range of colours if it takes off.Scrap GCSEs and focus on skills for ‘digital age’, senior MP saysSheffield student investigated after offensive messages about womenMinisters reject calls to ease ‘pointlessly cruel’ benefit sanctionsTurkey calls on China to close Muslim \u0027concentration camps\u0027 Ranjeet Rathore, president of the Union of Brunel Students, has been a driving force behind the hijab.“When we narrowed it down, we found the main gap to be in BAME female sports participation – specifically, we found there to be a barrier to Muslim women taking part in team sport,” he said.“Of course, they were participating in sports on their own and in private, but they weren’t really going out to competitions, or using sport as a social tool to get involved in activities.“There are now other unis that want to partner with us, who want to take samples off us, who want to do their own hijab – which is great news.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Brussels\u0026nbsphas insisted that\u0026nbspit will not reopen negotiations on the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspmeaning no changes to the controversial Irish\u0026nbspbackstop.On Tuesday, Ms May will have to ask MPs for more time to secure the changes she is seeking.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe\u0026nbspfurther delay has renewed speculation that this is a deliberate ploy, with Labour accusing the prime minister of “cynically” running down the clock.Some opponents claim that her strategy is to waste time and then\u0026nbspforce MPs to vote on her deal when it is too late to find any alternative.Move your Brexit red lines, Labour and EU both tell Theresa MayIn theory she could return to the Commons late in March –\u0026nbspjust days before the 29 March exit date –\u0026nbspand claim parliament has only two choices: back her deal\u0026nbspor leave the EU without an agreement.\u0026nbspMs May\u0026nbsphas already pushed back key votes on her Brexit deal, fuelling claims\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspshe is playing for time.First she delayed the “meaningful vote” on her\u0026nbspwithdrawal agreement\u0026nbspby more than\u0026nbspa month. Originally due to take place on 11 December, it was eventually held on 15 January.When the deal was rejected by an unprecedented\u0026nbsp230 votes, many people expected the prime minister to change strategy and pivot towards a softer Brexit, a no-deal outcome or some form of public vote.That has not happened. Instead, she\u0026nbsphas insisted she can secure the concessions from the EU that she believes she needs\u0026nbspto win parliament’s support for her deal, despite Brussels giving no indication\u0026nbspthat it is willing to budge.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentMore delays seem to be on the horizon. Last month, Ms May promised that she would either give MPs a vote on a revised deal\u0026nbspby 13 February or, if she had not been able to secure further changes, on an amendable motion updating the Commons on her negotiations.With no alternative deal\u0026nbspin sight, MPs will only\u0026nbspvote this week on the government’s update,\u0026nbspwhich is likely to say that more time is needed\u0026nbspto secure changes to the agreement.Ministers have floated\u0026nbspthe prospect of a similar vote being held on 27\u0026nbspFebruary, meaning a second vote on the deal itself\u0026nbspis unlikely to happen before the end of February at the earliest. Even if a deal is then approved, it would leave just a month for parliament to pass all the legialsation needed to enact Brexit.Video shows Jeremy Corbyn vowing to ‘defeat’ the EUFood industry threatens to end cooperation over no-deal riskCorbyn ‘cut second referendum line from letter to May’‘Take a breath’ and admit UK not ready for Brexit, Tory MPs tell MayAn EU summit scheduled for 22 March –\u0026nbspless than a week before Brexit day –\u0026nbspcould give Ms May justification for further delays, if she argues that this is when the EU will finally offer new concessions.\u0026nbspEven if no concessions were forthcoming, some people\u0026nbspbelieve that, faced with the threat of a no-deal Brexit in a matter of days, MPs would reluctantly\u0026nbspagree to support the prime minister’s plan (even if it is fundamentally unchanged from the one rejected in January).\u0026nbspBut any strategy involving running down the clock is highly risky, not least because it\u0026nbsprelies on parliament agreeing not to intervene in the coming weeks. Last month, Labour’s Yvette Cooper tabled an amendment that would have delayed Brexit until the end of the year if no deal was in place by the end of February.That motion was rejected by a margin of 23 votes, but as Brexit edges closer and the prospect of no deal becomes ever more likely, MPs might be swayed into backing another, similar\u0026nbspamendment.\u0026nbspThe Labour leadership is also seeking to torpedo Ms May’s ability to waste time. Jeremy Corbyn has written to the prime minister offering talks on a cross-party compromise deal, and will this week table an amendment that would force her to hold a second vote on her Brexit deal –\u0026nbsprevised or not –\u0026nbspby 26 February.No one other than Ms May and her closest advisers knows whether\u0026nbspshe is deliberately running down the clock.\u0026nbspBut the continual delays and her refusal to consider an extension to Article 50 do little to quash claims that this is her plan.Even if it is\u0026nbspnot, the fact remains that the 29 March Brexit date is enshrined in law and the UK is speeding towards it without a deal in sight. Whether or not it is deliberately\u0026nbspbeing run down,\u0026nbspthe clock is\u0026nbspticking ever louder.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

He will have dinner with Mr Barnier and try to convince him of the need for changes to the Irish backstop – which the EU has flat-out refused to countenance.But Mr Barnier said: “Tonight I will repeat the EU’s positions. I will listen to what the secretary of state has to tell us concerning the alternative arrangements which the UK would like“But it’s not more than a concept today. I will also evaluate the interest from the UK side for possible changes to the political declaration, which, let me remind you, fixes the outline quite precisely for the future separation.”David Lidington, Ms May’s Cabinet Brexit fixer, is also in the EU capital for meetings, and he and Mr Barclay will go to Strasbourg on Tuesday for meetings with MEPs.Speaking ahead of a meeting with the Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney on Monday, Mr Starmer told reporters: “We will have to see what happens next, but the point of the exercise is to say there is a majority for a close economic relationship if you are prepared to try to find it, and I said we should test that by having a vote on the customs union.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“The Labour Party has some concerns about the backstop but we absolutely accept that it’s inevitable that we need a backstop.

Former party chair Grant Shapps, a critic of the prime minister from the party’s liberal wing, said on Monday that there was “no point winning Labour MPs, by losing Tories”.But a second referendum would still not be certain with support from the Labour leadership – as a number of Labour MPs have said they would not vote for one in any circumstances, and only around a dozen Tory MPs have said they would support one.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Sir Antony Gormley sculpture was installed in 1998, with celebrations marking its 20th birthday this yearThe government accepted a recommendation to evaluate the effectiveness of reforms to welfare conditionality and sanctions, and said it would focus its evaluation on whether the sanctions regime within universal credit was effective at supporting claimants to search for work.\u0026nbspBut the committee said that while this was “clearly key”, the government was still not even considering the impact of sanctions on claimants’ financial and personal wellbeing.A 2012 law dramatically stepped up the sanctions regime inherited from Labour, making the penalties “longer, more severe and applicable to more people than ever before”, the MPs’ report said.If conditions are not met, benefits are docked for four weeks, which can mean a loss of £300 for a claimant over the age of 25 – but a sanction can last for three months, or even a year.The report last year found that the negative impact of sanctions actually stymied claiments’ efforts to find work, to the extent that the government’s approach appeared “arbitrarily punitive”.\u0026nbspThe MPs said the evidence they received was “more compelling than that against the imposition of conditionality and sanctions on people with a disability or health condition. It does not work. Worse, it is harmful and counterproductive.”Ministers broke pledge to review ‘pointlessly cruel‘ benefit sanctionsNo evidence that benefit sanctions work, finds secret DWP reportBenefit sanctions ‘increase poverty and push people into crime’Independent MP Frank Field, the chairman of the committee,\u0026nbspaccused the government on Monday of “failing utterly to grasp the seriousness of the matter” in its response to their concerns.He said: “Our report laid bare the inhumanity of the government’s sanctions regime, which it has pursued for years without ever stopping to check whether it works or what it is doing to the people it is meant to ‘support’.\u0026nbsp“It talks about reviews and ‘proof of concept’.\u0026nbspIt might want to take a look at the concept of not pushing disabled people and single parents – not to mention their children – into grinding poverty and hardship.”It comes after the government was accused of “sneaking out” a report which found there was\u0026nbsp“no evidence” that benefit sanctions encourage claimants to get into work or increase their earnings.The report, published with no ministerial announcement in September, showed\u0026nbspdocking benefits as a punishment for alleged failures to comply with Jobcentre Plus rules did not encourage claimants to apply for additional work, and in some cases “damaged\u0026nbspthe relationship between the work coach and the claimant”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

However, consumer confidence has started to come under pressure with British households £1,500 worse off on average than was forecast before the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.Households had been supplementing meagre earnings growth by increasing their levels of debt, but consumer credit growth dropped in December.The Bank of England reported\u0026nbspthe annual growth of unsecured lending in the month fell to 6.6 per cent, down from 7.2 per cent in November.This was the weakest figure since December 2014. Credit card lending growth slowed to 7.1 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent the previous month.A number of economists precisted the slowdown would continue into 2019 unless the government could deliver a degree of certainty about\u0026nbspthe UK’s trading relationship with the EU.Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said Brexit ucertainty and slowing global growth were “suffocating” economic\u0026nbspactivity.\u0026nbspHe added: “The continued decline in business investment is a blackspot for the economy as it undermines the UK’s ability to raise productivity and increase our long-term growth prospects.“It is increasingly likely that the slowdown at the end of 2018 will persist as continued Brexit uncertainty and the raised possibility of a no-deal exit from the EU weigh heavily on UK’s growth prospects. Firms are increasingly reporting having to ert staff, money and investment to protect against the chaos of a no-deal Brexit.”Paul Dales, chief UK economist\u0026nbspat Capital Economics, said the ONS figures support the more downbeat view given by the Bank of England last week.“But they also suggest there is plenty of scope for the economy to bounce back once the Brexit uncertainty is removed,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In part, that is because they have revealed the outline of part of the object that was initially not visible because it was not lit by the Sun – but could be seen by tracing out the background stars that it had blocked out.New Nasa images reveal ‘highly unusual’ shape of Ultima ThuleInstead of being a snowman, the two sections are not spherical at all. The bigger part is like a giant pancake and the smaller one is like a dented walnut, the scientists say.We had an impression of Ultima Thule based on the limited number of images returned in the days around the flyby, but seeing more data has significantly changed our view, Stern said. It would be closer to reality to say Ultima Thule\u0027s shape is flatter, like a pancake. But more importantly, the new images are creating scientific puzzles about how such an object could even be formed. We\u0027ve never seen something like this orbiting the Sun.The images aren\u0027t the last to be captured or sent by New Horizons, which began its work on Ultima Thule after exploring Pluto. But they are the last views thatit captured as it raced away after its New Years flyby, travelling past at 31,000 miles per hour.The images were snapped just 10 minutes after New Horizons passed by its closest approach to the distant object.This really is an incredible image sequence, taken by a spacecraft exploring a small world four billion miles away from Earth, said Stern. Nothing quite like this has ever been captured in imagery.Much of the scientific data being collected is being used to understand how small planets might have formed in the early solar system. But the shocking and strange shape of Ultima Thule could change that understanding fundamentally, scientists say.While the very nature of a fast flyby in some ways limits how well we can determine the true shape of Ultima Thule, the new results clearly show that Ultima and Thule are much flatter than originally believed, and much flatter than expected, added Hal Weaver, New Horizons project scientist from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. This will undoubtedly motivate new theories of planetesimal formation in the early solar system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It says “the far right and right-wing Eurosceptics will, if current polling is accurate, rise from 23 per cent to 28 per cent” with this potentially rising to around 30 per cent once the campaign is underway.“They could even gain more than 30 per cent of seats if their popularity continues to grow or if some of the fringe members of the mainstream join them. If they cross the one-third threshold, this would signify a qualitative change in the EU,” the report adds.In certain policy areas, dissent from the mainstream by the eurosceptic far-left – such as on trade, sanctions, and foreign policy – could also make passing legislation difficult.\u0026nbspThough the assorted eurosceptic parties across the continent have struggled to form a coherent alliance, when it comes to votes in parliament they have often voted in a similar direction. Despite being spread across disparate political groups, most populist forces voted against sanctions against Hungary in a crunch vote last year.There are also increasing moves to try to unite the groups – such as the plan for an “anti-immigration axis” proposed by Italy’s de facto leader Matteo Salvini. Far-right US figure Steve Bannon has also unveiled plans to unite the groups, though it is unclear whether he will be successful.\u0026nbspParliament isn’t perfect – in Brussels or Westminster“The warning in this report, that anti-European parties are gaining strength and could paralyse the EU, should concentrate the minds of pro-Europeans,” said Mark Leonard, director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.“They must not become trapped into becoming defenders of the status quo in Europe or allowing the election to become a referendum on the issue of migration – which is exactly the battleground that the anti-Europeans want.“Instead, pro-Europeans need to unmute the silent majority by fighting different elections that Europe’s different publics will vote on – such as the climate change election, the ‘Facebook’ election for those concerned for their data and privacy, the election for those worried about Russian aggression, the prosperity election for those worried about stalled living standards, the rule of law election for those worried about democratic backsliding, and the ‘saving Europe’ election for the EU’s most ardent defenders.”\u0026nbspThe European Parliament elections are scheduled for 23-26 May. The UK is not scheduled to take part as it is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Russia was strong, he argued, only because it had rejected western notions and democratic institutions. Such institutions\u0026nbsponly\u0026nbspgave\u0026nbspan “illusion of choice”, and were inferior to Russia’s wise\u0026nbspleader, who was\u0026nbspable to “listen, understand and see” his\u0026nbsppeople.“The modern model of Russian statehood begins on trust and rests on trust,” he said. “This is its major distinction to the western model, which cultivates distrust and criticism. And herein lies its\u0026nbspstrength.” \u0026nbspWriting on Facebook, the political commentator Abbas Gallyamov\u0026nbspnoted wryly that Mr Surkov’s idea of trust appeared at\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsptime of\u0026nbsppolls registering historically low levels of trust in\u0026nbspthe leadership.Putin heralds successful tests of new hypersonic nuclear weaponsStep up Vladimir Putin, president of Belarus? Putin: Russia will develop intermediate-range missiles if US doesMr Surkov spared little praise of his boss.\u0026nbspIn time, Putin’s Russia would be recognised Russia’s fourth great “model of state-building”, he said – and on a par with the efforts of Ivan the Great in the 15th century, Peter the Great in the 18th century, and Vladimir Lenin in the 20th century.\u0026nbspPutin’s system was also ripe for export, Mr Surkov\u0026nbspadded. Foreign governments were already paying close attention, since the\u0026nbspRussian “political algorithm” had long predicted\u0026nbspthe volatility now seen in western democracies.\u0026nbsp“Russia is playing with the west’s minds,” he writes. “They don’t know how to deal with their own changed consciousness.” \u0026nbspDuring his peak in the 2000s,\u0026nbspMr Surkov cultivated an image of being an all-powerful operator, expertly recruiting and co-opting all strands of ideology political opinion. But his ambitions always went further than being an operator. He saw himself as the beating intellectual heart of the regime.\u0026nbspMr Surkov, while still an influential player, is no longer at the heart of the Kremlin policy machine.\u0026nbspHe fell out of favour with Vladimir Putin\u0026nbspafter appearing to side with Dmitry Medvedev in the tempestuous protest years of 2008-2012, and\u0026nbspwas unceremoniously dropped in favour of rival Vyacheslav Volodin.\u0026nbspSince then, Mr Surkov is believed to have taken charge of the Kremlin’s secret campaign in eastern Ukraine, has acted as Russia’s point of contact in the Minsk peace negotiations, and\u0026nbsphas taken to penning lofty\u0026nbspessays about the state of Russia.\u0026nbspPresidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said\u0026nbspMr Surkov’s “complex”, “interesting” and “deep” article had been neither approved or seen\u0026nbspby the president.

They are carrying posters of the Ayatollah Khomeini, the Iranian religious and political leaderThe Islamic Republic not only survives, it has become a force to be reckoned with throughout the region through allies in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen, and clandestine networks stretching from south Asia, the Arabian Peninsula, and north Africa to Europe and Latin America.\u0026nbspBut the country is also deeply troubled, and its leaders know it. The country’s young, women, and minorities are demanding systemic change.\u0026nbspThey want jobs, social freedoms, and cultural and political rights. Yet the regime’s 40-year survival, experts say, is due in large part to the very repression and vigilant surveillance that so rankle Iranians who belong to social and political tribes outside of the circle of hardline Shia Islamists that monopolize political power.\u0026nbsp“The regime of the Islamic Republic was able to endure because it was able to maintain the ideological integrity of its elites, through processes of political and ideological vetting,” says Tamer Badawi, an Iran expert at the al Sharq Center in Istanbul, a think tank.\u0026nbsp“This prevented outside powers from creating coalitions with institutional players in the establishment.”With a white bearded and a black-turban, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini arrived on an airplane from France on 1 February 1979, settling himself up - with the help of fervent supporters - in what had been a girls school called Refah in an alleyway in downtown Tehran. He conferred with activists and dignitaries crowding in to see him and hear his words for 10 days.\u0026nbspAnd then on this day 40 years ago, Ayatollah Khomeini declared the end of thousands years of Iranian monarchy, marking the official victory of the Islamic Revolution, and raising hopes among Iranians for a future of peace, prosperity and justice.\u0026nbspBut hopes for the future were dashed almost straight away. The fledgling regime shock troops began a long, dreadful night of Robespierrean terror almost straight away, launching purges and mass executions of political rivals and members of the former regime.\u0026nbspIslamist thugs knifed women at protests against the now mandatory hijab. Newly established Islamist courts began enforcing strict restrictions on press, politics, and religion. A vast terrifying surveillance state spread its tentacles into streets, universities, workplaces, and even homes. \u0026nbspThose deemed insufficiently loyal to the new regime were purged, warehoused in prisons like the notorious compound in Tehran’s Evin district, and hounded into exile.\u0026nbspThe regime viciously targeted the country’s once thriving Baha’i religious minority, feminists, leftists, and liberals, storming into their homes in the dead of night.\u0026nbspAyatollah Khomeini eventually was moved to a compound in the north of Tehran, and the Refah school became a torture chamber where perceived opponents were shot dead on its roof.\u0026nbspThe regime encountered severe resistance from Iranians from the start, but managed to hold together thanks to a series of crises that kept the ruling elite united, and bound the society to the state. \u0026nbspFirst came the burdens of a devastating eight-year war with Iraq that continue to haunt the country. Saddam Hussein’s troops invaded, backed by Persian Gulf countries and eventually the West. Rockets rained down upon Iranian cities.\u0026nbspThen came numerous rounds of harsh international sanctions led by the US under seven American presidents, but joined occasionally by many other nations as well as private companies who stay away from the Islamic Republic.\u0026nbspSeveral popular uprisings have come and gone, including one almost 10 years ago that saw millions flooding into the streets in scenes reminiscent of the revolution itself.Perhaps the biggest challenge came from within its own ranks. A group of regime loyalists who once called themselves the “Followers of the line of the Imam” Khomeini began to sour on the failed promises of the regime and increasing power of the most radical hardline factions, rebranded themselves reformists in the 1990s and sought to cultivate support among middle class Iranians.\u0026nbspOver the years the regime learned to adapt, and exploit the pressure for its own ends. Ali Fathollah Nejad, an Iran scholar at the Brookings Doha Centre, describes how successive waves of pressure that many predicted would lead to the regime’s downfall instead strengthened it.\u0026nbsp“Since its inception, the new rulers have willfully mastered the art of using and abusing external pressure and crises to create a rally-‘round-the-flag effect centered around the narrative of Iran being an innocent victim in the face of unjustified and abusive imperialist powers, and to engage in disavowing and cracking down on internal dissenters portrayed as stooges of malign outside forces,” he says.To create and win loyal constituencies, the Islamic Republic cultivated middle classes through a web of institutional vehicles through which it disseminated it\u0027s revolutionary ideology\u0026nbspBut in addition to repression it sought to create its own educated elite, and even bind the old intelligentsia to the current system. It expanded literacy, higher education, healthcare, and electrification, and invested in the provinces.“To create and win loyal constituencies, the Islamic Republic cultivated middle classes through a web of institutional vehicles through which it disseminated it\u0027s revolutionary ideology,” says Mr Badawi. “Urbanisation was one of the reasons for the loyalty of new stratas originating from Iran\u0027s rural spaces.”But the conservative clergy and military hardliners that make up the inner circle of the regime have also been blessed with an opposition that was ided and fragmented.\u0026nbsp“It’s a regime that’s very much aware of the dynamic nature of Iranian society and its managed to exploit that dynamis,” says Sanam Vakil, an Iran expert at Chatham House.\u0026nbsp“There’s not been a history of social cohesion in Iran, and Iranians are not particularly united in what they want, even if they’re relatively united in what they don’t what.”“Allahu akbar,” the cries from the rooftops rang out at night almost 10 years ago, when huge segments of the Iranian population flooded into the streets to oppose the reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad amid fraud allegations, sometimes coopting slogans and tactics of the revolutionaries 30 years earlier.\u0026nbspThe millions included members of the Islamic Republic’s own elite, the sons and daughters of politicians and judges, and they marched with defiant slogans near Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s headquarters in Tehran, giving the the system’s s the fright of their life.\u0026nbspAs the 2009 uprising as well as the nationwide demonstrations last year showed, even beneficiaries of the Islamic Republic have begun to bristle at its restrictions and failures, at its unfulfilled promises of freedom from tyranny as well as its inability to deliver economic prosperity. The regime managed to fend off the massive 2009 challenge, and easily suppressed the protests last year.\u0026nbspSome segments of Iran’s younger generation are disillusioned with the regime and remain hopeful that change is on the horizonBut discontent continues to run wide and deep. A survey conducted in December by IranPoll based on opinions from more than 1,000 Iranians showed more than 70 per cent of Iranians believe the economy is faring poorly and nearly 65 per cent said it was getting worse.\u0026nbspAlmost 60 per cent blame government incompetence and corruption as the primary cause of the poor economy rather than US sanctions.For now, the hardliners retain a tight grip on the security apparatuses, judiciary, and key segments of the economy. But reformists and moderates win election after election.“Even though Ayatollah Khomeini’s revolutionary vision remains popular with the old guard, allowing his successor to maintain a firm hold on power,” a note issued by the Soufan Group, an intelligence and security consultancy said on Monday, “some segments of Iran’s younger generation are disillusioned with the regime and remain hopeful that change is on the horizon.”While it falters on the economy and providing hope to the young, the Islamic Republic has scored historic strategic victories abroad in recent years. It has bolstered its influence in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Yemen.\u0026nbspWashington conservatives say Iran’s foreign policy ambitions are rooted in the ideology of the regime. But time after time, Iran has exploited the mistakes of its adversaries, suggesting an opportunistic power aiming to expand Iran’s national influence, often with tools other than raw military power.\u0026nbspWest pressures Iran on missiles even as it refines their own rocketsIran’s ban on dog walking won’t stop owners taking out their pets\u0027Staggering\u0027 levels of repression in Iran last yearIran impatient to go to war with Israel, says head of air forceMy wife’s Iran prison hunger strike is an act of despair, not defianceIn the aftermath of the US abandonment of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Tehran opted to stay in the agreement, making Washington look like the outlier, and prompting a rift between America and Europe.\u0026nbsp“Iran’s diplomacy has proved deft, particularly in response to the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal and related attempts to isolate Iran politically,” said the Soufan Group note. “Iran has continued to adhere to the agreement, using that compliance as leverage to compel the European Union countries to defy US pressure to enforce re-imposed sanctions on Iran.”While considered the most objectionable dimension of the Islamic Republic, Iran’s foreign policy and defense advances have yielded a domestic political idend in a country that is becoming increasingly nationalistic, and sensitive to threats from abroad as a result of the Iran-Iraq war.We have not asked and will not ask anyone permission to build different types of anti-armour missiles, air defence, surface-to-sea, sea-to-sea, air-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles\u0026nbspThe US, EU, Saudi Arabia, and Israel have demanded that Iran roll back its support for militant groups across the Middle East, stop refining its missile programmes, and maintain restrictions on its nuclear programme.\u0026nbspBut in the IranPoll findings, 86 per cent of respondents said the country should either maintain or increase the support it gives to armed groups fighting “terrorist groups like Isis.” Around 90 per cent said it was important to pursue nuclear technology. And 95 per cent said they supported the country’s development of missiles.\u0026nbspIn his speech from the podium on Monday Mr Rouhani boasted that Iran’s military-technological developments have stunned the world, increasing dramatically in particular during his five years as president.We have not asked and will not ask anyone permission to build different types of anti-armour missiles, air defence, surface-to-sea, sea-to-sea, air-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles,” he said. “We will continue our path and our military power.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Read on to find out where the Labour leader stands on Brexit.On the day of the EU Referendum on rd June  Jeremy Corbyn tweeted to confirm he had voted to remain in the EU.The Labour leader wrote: “I’ve just voted to Remain. The EU provides the best framework to meet the challenges of our time #LabourInForBritain.”On January  he was asked on the Andrew Marr show whether he would back Brexit before a new election, the far-left politician provided five confused answers to the question when asked five times.Mr Marr asked: What I want to know is what do you, as Labour leader, want to happen to Brexityou win that election.You are campaigning to leave. You are campaigning to leave but leave on your own terms.Corbyn said his party would restart negotiations with Brusselshe stormed to victory in a general election.A priority for Labour would be a new customs union to keep the current trade benefits the UK has as a member state.He said: As a very minimum, a customs arrangement with the European Union that gives us a say of what goes on but also avoid the whole issue of the problem of Northern Ireland – which this deal does.Secondly, access to the single market, which is crucial.What I’m saying is we’re campaigning for a country that is brought together by investment.Corbyn sent the PM a letter on February  outlining exactly how the Labour Party will support May.The Labour leader made it clear that her modications to the Northern Irish backstop are not enough to win his party’s support.He told her thatshe makes these five legally-binding commitments that Labour will support her.The commitments are:Corbyn has already clashed with members of his own party who would rather have a second Brexit referendum.The Labour leader is hoping this letter will get members to stop demanding the second referendum – as it is not mentioned in the letter.Corbyn has called Labour’s approach “constructive”.He has not mentioned extending Article .The PM responded to the Labour leader agreed to enter further talks with his party over his plans to stay in the EU Customs Union and remain closely aligned to the single market.Her response has sparked fresh fears that caving into the hard-left leader would be chaos for the UK.Some have branded it as political madness.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the latest on how its affecting your cash.On February  the pound is trading at . against the euro.It has fallen by . per cent.It was previously at ..The pound fell . percent on January  after lawmakers voted to demand Theresa May renegotiate the terms of Brexit but rejected an amendment that would have postponed Britains scheduled March  departure.However, an amendment that stipulated averting a no-deal Brexit did pass, and analysts said risks of a chaotic Brexit had risen only slightly.Goldman Sachs, for example, put the chances at  percent compared with an earlier  percent forecast.A weaker pound is better for British exports - but imports will cost more, potentially driving up inflation.It also means your money doesnt stretch as far when going abroad on holiday.Before the November drop the exchange rate had remained relatively stable for months following a more volatile period earlier in .Sterling dipped below €. on March   and then reached almost €. on April  .In August  the rate briefly plunged under €., the lowest for nearly a decade, but it quickly recovered.Before the EU referendum in June  a pound was trading for around €.. Sterling fell around  per cent after the result.The highest rate in recent years was €. in November .Foreign exchangemarkets allow currencies to be bought and sold around the world.They are necessary for international commerce but are also opportunities for traders to make a profit by effectively gambling on whether rates go up or down.As in any market, rates are determined by the price that buyers and sellers are willing to accept.If more people are buying than selling the price will go up, and vice versa.Traders confidence in a countrys economic health is the biggest factor shaping forex markets.Reports and forecasts on GDP growth, inflation, employment, retail sales and manufacturing can prompt traders to buy or sell a countrys currency.Other factors that sway forex markets include interest rate decisions by central banks , and news such as the signing of a trade deal or a natural disaster.Movements in global capital markets, bond markets and stock markets can also influence forex trading.Banks and money changers who sell holiday cash broadly follow foreign exchange markets in the rates they offer the public.The buy and sell price for each currency is usually a few percentage points either side of the true rate so they can make a profit eventhere is no commission.Unstable and unpredictable government events can also negatively impact the pounds strength in trading.Following the resignations of Theresa Mays Cabinet in response to her draft Brexit proposal on Thursday, the pound plummeted to its lowest value in over a year.Euros can be bought at supermarkets, such as Marks  Spencer, as well as the Post Office and currency specialists – but rates y massively.The best rates can often be found at specialist online outlets, such as Travelex, which will deliver cash directly to your home.Travellers can use comparison sites, like MoneySavingExperts TravelMoneyMax, to find the best rate.If you order in advance and pick up the cash then you’ll most likely get a better rate thanyou walk into a bureau de change.Alternatively, providers such as FairFX and WeSwap offer currency cards that can load up at a good rate and then use abroad like a debit card without transaction fees on each purchase.You can always buy last-minute currency at the airport or withdraw cash at your destination, but its almost always cheaper to buy before you go.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quick, the ambassador has had a seizure!Had Herr President Tusk, at this most delicate of moments, really told the likes of Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage to go to hell  Yes, pretty much.I know we are supposed to take ­mortal offence. I know we are meant to fan our faces and ask Nurse to bring us something to soothe our nerves after that nasty man uttered such a frightful insult.But I couldn’t help laughing at toothless Tusk’s tirade.At last, a European Union bigshot has blurted out his contempt for British voters.That’s surely preferable to all those smarmy smiles and fake phrases about “respect for each other’s values” and how we hope to work with “our European friends and partners”. Real friends don’t nick £billion off you.There are two things worth knowing about Donald Tusk. The first is that in his youth he was a bit of a brawler.The ­second is that five years ago he resigned as Polish prime minister to take up his current cushy number in ­Brussels.Born in , Tusk grew up in the city of Gdansk, when Poland was a grimy ­colony of the USSR. His family had ­German roots and his dad, a carpenter, died when Donald was . It can’t have made for an easy youth.Gdansk gave rise to the Solidarity trade union ­movement which protested against Iron Curtain suppression.Tusk has recalled that in his youth he was “a typical hooligan” who would ­saunter along the streets in a gang, ­“cruising for a bruising”.In some ways, who can blame him  They were edgy days and young men will do what young men have done since time immemorial: Defend themselvesunder attack. Communism wasa ­stinking and ruinous creed.Decent Poles bravely reasserted their national sovereignty after too many decades of being governed by ideological bureaucrats who couldn’t give a fig about the electorate.Er, remind you of anything, Mister ­Eurocrat That colourful background in the Gdansk of the s and s made it all the odder when, in , Tusk quit the premiership of his country to become an EU grand fromage.He had been Poland’s PM for seven years and the country had done well.Yet he chucked that in so that he could succeed shrivelling nonentity ­Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.The job is less important than it sounds. Its occupant basically acts as a collector of opinions from EU heads of government and acts as their representative at ­international shindigs.That it was held by such a blinky-eyed vole as Van Rompuy was a measure of its signicance. Yet Tusk chucked in the prime ministership of his country for it!Brussels may offer wonderful pensions, top-trough brasseries and as many rides in the back of a BMW  Series as you could wish, but had Tusk gone mad The answer to that question is “not ­necessarily”. He saw that under EU rules, national governments are now increasingly junior to the federal superpower.The real power in Brussels lies not with Tusk, nor even with boozy European ­Commission president Jean-Claude ­Juncker, but with the backroom officials such as Martin Selmayr and Sabine ­Weyand. Both of them, you may notice, are ­German. This sht in powers has ­happened slowly over decades and ­electorates have taken a while to notice.But now the voters are copping on and are at last making their ­displeasure plain.The British Leave vote was the firstgreat expression of that anger.All of which helps to explain why ­unelected EU officials have been so ­spittingly angry with the British public for voting Leave. We have busted the dam.That is why Tusk snarled at us on Wednesday.

There’s so much he’s got to give! He’s completely positive!In footage from , the then anonymous backbench MP from the People’s Republic of Islington ­lambasts “the European empire” and mocks Brussels for wanting referendums re-run until they produce the “correct” result.Oh, Jeremy Corbyn!I bet all the middle-class kiddies who worshipped at your sandals-and-socks combo at Glastonbury never saw this coming.The footage of Corbyn dissing Brussels to an Irish audience is so incendiary it makes Liam Neeson look as though he chooses his words carefully.Comrade Corbyn really, really could not be clearer about his true feelings.“We are creating here one massive great Frankenstein which will damage all of us in the long run,” he says of the EU.“If you succeed in getting a No vote herethat will be such a boost to people like us, all over Europe, who do not want to live in a European empire of the st century.”You tell ’em, Boris! I mean, Jeremy!After being forced out of the Brexit closet, JC can no longer cynically have it both ways — playing a Remainer to the middle class and a Leaver to the working class. That hypocritical ploy to squeeze into  Downing Street will no longer fly.It is a dead ploy. That ploy is extinct. It is no more.On the great issue of our time, the old boy just got shoved right off the fence. And fell on his face.Donald Tusk, Brussels’ head bully boy, digressed from condemning .million Brits to hell for voting Leave to sneer that there is a “leadership void” in the Remain camp. He means YOU, Jeremy.Tusk has seen right through two-faced Corbyn, evenall the little Marxist morons who chant his name are only just waking up to the cruel truth. Corbyn deserves to be despised by both sides of the debate.He placed the prospect of power above his principles. And we still don’t really know how he voted in the Referendum — although we can make an educated guess.The irony is that Jeremy Corbyn could have been a true hero to the working-class men and women who have voted Labour for a letime and then voted in their millions to leave the EU.Corbyn could have spoken for those men and women and stood up for them when the sneering elite dismissed them as thick, racist bigots too stupid to have a valid opinion.It was Tony Benn, Corbyn’s great hero, and the most eloquent opponent of the European Union in our nation’s history, who famously said he felt like “a slave to Rome” when he went to Brussels.Tony Benn would have had the courage to advocate Brexit and ­Corbyn must know it.Jeremy will be a tiny footnote in our nation’s history but what a crying shame that, in our country’s time of need, the Labour Party could not produce a leader who would represent the millions of working-class men and women who have learned to despise the EU.Corbyn tried to play it smart — and still does — by endlessly parroting that “everything is on the table” and never truly engaging with the debate that has come close to tearing this country apart.And now he has been caught out because Corbyn, always more Mickey Mouse than Machiavelli, was never clever enough to play this duplicitous game.The EU is revealing its true nature — a bullying empire that has no interest in being a partner, friend or ally of the Britishwe eventually manage to leave.The EU wants to see us on our knees.The EU wants to see us suffer for refusing to be their obedient colony.The EU wants us to pay such a high price for leaving that the remaining countries will be too timid to dream of le beyond this democracy-despising empire.All we can do is oppose these arrogant, unelected bullies. All we can do is demand our independence — no matter the dark warnings, no matter the sneering, no matter the threat of punishment beatings.What a tragedy for Labour that their leader never had the guts to join this nation’s fight for independence.ELLE MACPHERSON has revealed her simple guide for looking drop dead gorgeous.Most of Elle’s tips are eminently doable for any of us – eat your evening meal early , get fresh air every day, have some calming tea before bedtime and,sleep doesn’t come, put your feet up for five minutes.Only one of The Body’s tips is more dficult to arrange – Elle suggests regular relaxation in a sauna or steam room – but most of her guidelines for healthy radiance are simple common sense.But she has missed the most important tip of all.Be born beautul.Don’t forget that one, Elle!THE Tories are very keen on “autonomous” vehicles – driverless cars with no steering wheels and “no human oversight” – and hope that they will be zipping about on our roads within two years.Automotive minister Richard Harrington says: “We need to ensure we take the public with us as we move towards having self-driving cars on our roads by .”But I remember when a Labour government swore to us that diesel cars were the bright, shining future.In , Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced tax changes to petrol-fuelled cars that led to a massive increase in idiots like me buying diesel cars.The thinking was that diesel would help the environment because diesel engines produce less carbon dioxide than petrol engines.Unfortunately, diesel also produces far more pollutants and poisons, resulting in around , deaths every year.Whoops.I now have an elderly diesel car sitting on the drive that everyone hates.My excuse is that Gordon Brown told me I was saving the planet.Nobody wants diesel today. That is why Japanese car- maker Nissan will not be building its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. Brexit doesn’t come into it.These days driving a diesel is considered to be slightly less healthy than smoking crack. And the Tory “dash to driverless” is as muddle-headed as the Labour “dash to diesel” when Gordon Brown was in his pomp.Driverless cars – what could possibly go wrong WHEN Prince Charles met the Spice Girls in , the Prince of Wales clearly towered above the then Geri Halliwell.Reunited this week, they now appear to be the same height.Has the former Ginger Spice grown over the last  years Or is our future king shrinking  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You’re an anarchic shambles, without any discipline.His hardline views, formed more than four decades ago, reportedly positions which are much more extreme than current Labour policy.Mr Corbyn believes any controls on immigration are intrinsically racist and supports fully open borders, according to the book.Mr Bower also claims the Labour chief has never abandoned his lelong opposition to Britains EU membership.Although he publicly backed Remain, the biography says Mr Corbyn found regular excuses not to campaign properly.He was seen laughing with his allies the morning after Leave won the vote - but denied that hed secretly voted for Brexit.The party leaders close allies John McDonnell and Seamus Milne both voted for Leave, according to Mr Bower.When Mr Corbyn took over the party in , allies expressed concern that he was too nice to force through the hard-left agenda.But he apparently told Ken Livingstone: John McDonnell will do all the scary stuff.The telly star has apparently teamed up with JK Rowlings agent to try and set up a new political movement.The efforts are being led by two former Blair aides who believe Mr Corbyn has made Labour unelectable.And superstar author Ms Rowling has been suggested as a possible leader of the new party.Ms Riley and Eastenders actress Tracy Ann Oberman were among the guests at an event to discuss the new movement last week, the Mail on Sunday reported.Jonathan Powell and Phil Collins, who both worked for Tony Blair in No, hosted the party at the office of Ms Rowlings agent Neil Blair.They said they want the new political grouping to be launched later this year.Guests cheered when one member of the crowd said Ms Rowling should take charge because of her high public profile.The book also accuses Mr Corbyn of inspiring attacks on Jewish MPs whove spoken out against the partys anti-Semitism scandal, and using bullyboy tactics to inspire support.The MPs political obsession is so intense that it repeatedly took priority over the wellbeing of his family, Mr Bower says,He reportedly called Mr Veness to talk about Northern Ireland policy - as his second we Claudia was giving birth.His friend blasted: Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about  You’re about to be a father!But there was one moment when his principles did take a backseat - when he was invited to dinner with Fidel Castro.Despite being a devoted vegetarian, he happily ate beef when it was offered to him by the Cuban dictator.Tory chairman Brandon Lewis told the Mail on Sunday: What Corbyn has done to his own party is shameful, what he would do to our country would be a tragedy.

But it strikes a powerful chord with real people, particularly voters in the North.They resent claims they are racist thickos and believe all parties lied to them in  when they promised to deliver on the referendum, whatever the outcome.Like the BBC — and, indeed, the EU itself — Remainers are slow to realise time is running out. Brexit is to the EU what Netflix is to the BBC. The £billion licence fee — like the European “Grand Project” — is on its way out.Whatever last-minute deal Theresa May brings home, the scepticism which brought Brexit to le cannot simply be turned off.It is a disruptive force and is already beginning to sweep away the EU as we know it.Economist Bernard Connolly famously identied this as the logical consequence of EU skulduggery in his book The Rotten Heart Of Europe: The Dirty War For Europe’s Money.Connolly was in charge of setting up the euro, the slow-burning catastrophe which has wrecked economies and young lives across the EU.He was sacked for exposing the secretive abuse of power at the very top, exposing the unscrupulous methods deployed by an unaccountable regime to bludgeon critics into submission.The same tactics are used on rebellious nations like Britain today and Greece in , triggering the explosion of anger we are seeing among protesting citizens and a rise of authoritarianism against such dissent.EU states are at each other’s throats — Italy against France, Brussels against Hungary and Poland.The rise of military-style policing — French police firing hard rubber bullets at unarmed yellow-jacket protestors, the jailing of dissident politicians in Catalonia — is alarming.Romania, a former Soviet police state, is reverting to type and spying on its own citizens.Hungary locks up opponents and silences the media.The EU does nothing, fearing for its own survival.Europe-wide polls reveal increasing antagonism to Brussels, deeper even than here in the UK.He remains a cherished champion of free speech and razor-sharp inquisitorial combat.Mean-spirited as ever, the left-wingcould not resist suggesting he was past his sell-by date.Not by such a margin as this preachy, unpopular rag which is about to go out of print.Those politicians who believe we mustto the EU’s totalitarian embrace are grievously out of step.Yes, Brexit has been botched, both by Theresa May and by Brexiteers themselves.

They walked in to find a naked woman on the bed.One of the visitors recalled: “There on the mattress on the floor in the one room is Diane with the duvet up to her neck, saying, ‘What the ****’s going on ’ We were quite shaken.” As Abbott tried to protect her modesty, Corbyn announced she was his new girlfriend.The source continued: “It was the late Seventies, it was still a point of interest, a white man with a black woman, so he was slightly showing off – ‘I’ve got a new girlfriend, and she’s black’.”At the time Abbott was working at the National Council for Civil Liberties.When colleagues went through her desk they found an eyebrow-raising sexual fantasy scrawled in her diary. In it she described being man- handled by her lover Corbyn – “a bearded Fenian and NUPE national organiser”.The loved-up pair went on a motorbike tour of East Germany, while Abbott has described her “finest half-hour” as romping in a Cotswold field with a mystery man, believed to be Corbyn.Author Bower claims the relationship broke down because Abbott wanted children but he did not.On one occasion, according to the new book, the family was invited to spend a week at a friend’s country home in Derbyshire, but Corbyn failed to show.For  hours, Claudia called around trying to track him down.He eventually arrived two days later, vaguely explaining his absence as a necessary sacrice for “the movement”.Even when Claudia was in hospital about to give birth to their first child in , Corbyn was more concerned with local leafletting.He was running for re-election at the time, and phoned constituency agent Keith Veness from outside the delivery room with an important update.Corbyn announced: “I’m really worried — we haven’t put out that leaflet about Northern Ireland.”His friend replied: “Haven’t you got something more serious to worry about ”Corbyn had met Claudia in  — seven years after his orce from first we Jane Chapman — at a protest meeting against Chile’s military dictatorship.Claudia was already married but, by the following year, she was pregnant with Corbyn’s child and rushed through a orce to marry her new admirer.They went on to have three boys — Sebastian, Benjamin and Thomas — before calling time on their relationship in .Corbyn managed to give the split a political spin, declaring the break was down to Claudia refusing to send their son to a failing comprehensive and he “felt strongly about comprehensive education”.But fellow Labour firebrand Ken Livingstone claims the marriage ended “long before the school bit”.She recalled: “Jeremy professed love early on and said that I was ‘the best of the best’, so I thought this must be the thing.”But the -year-old bride quickly discovered that “her husband was not interested in equality within marriage, or in sharing any domestic chores”.Despite the two of them both being councillors, she found herself doing the housework and being stuck alone in their small flat night after night.When Corbyn did arrive in time for dinner, he would often open a tin of beans, usually Tesco’s own brand, and eat them cold.On livelier evenings, he would sit on the floor drunkenly singing IRA songs. Jane’s requests to go out were ignored.Meanwhile, she was shocked that the opinionated “thinker” did not read a single book during their years together.Author Tom Bower writes: “Her initial judgment that he was ‘bright’ was mistaken.”Holidays were also grim — with his idea of a summer getaway being a tour with his we of an impoverished Eastern bloc country, sleeping in tents. The marriage ended in , with Corbyn patronisingly putting the split down to a “feminist kick”.Chapman, now a university professor and filmmaker, said: “He didn’t acknowledge my emotional side. He doesn’t recognise a woman’s feelings.”She added: “His lack of emotional awareness didn’t change.”And, in his new book, author Tom Bower claims it was a result of Corbyn’s poor financial management. Corbyn was funding his party office in Holloway, North London, out of his own pocket and was seriously in debt.Claudia and their three young sons were left with so little money for food and clothes that she once pleaded: “We can’t afford a decent le.”Eventually, after the couple split, the family home in Islington, North London, was sold for £,to pay off the debts.Claudia and the boys moved into the top floors of a smaller home, with Corbyn in the basement. There he had a series of flings with younger women, according to Bower’s book, out on February .His success with the opposite sex confused many, with one old friend telling him: “You couldn’t pull all these womenyou weren’t an MP. They wouldn’t be interested in an old man with a beard.”The hard-Left MP for North Islington was far more understanding when it came to Soviet communist leaders oppressing others.His old friend Keith Veness said Corbyn believed Soviet leaders had rightly put down a revolt in Hungary in  and the pro-democracy Prague Spring in .And when Veness mentioned Joseph Stalin’s brutality against his own people, he says: “Jeremy walked away. He couldn’t do political arguments.”In the extract from his book in yesterday’s Mail on Sunday, author Bower also portrays Corbyn’s party as an anarchic mess where neither the leader nor many of his overpaid team turn up for meetings on time.He writes: “Meetings arranged to start at am were delayed because no one arrived until , and some staff did not come to work at all.” An insider told the author: “They were lazy and p***ed on £, a year.”Meanwhile, in the same year as his orce, Corbyn met Mexican ex-human rights lawyer Laura Alez,  years his junior.They conducted a long-distance relationship before she moved to the UK in , and they wed the following year.Laura has rarely spoken about their relationship — but, in , gave a telling insight into marriage with the proud leftie: “He’s not very good at housework.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We just don’t know whether there would have been a better way of spending the money.You might ask the question what  could you do  You could give larger sums of money to Manchester to Birmingham, to Newcastle and let them do as they saw best for their local communities.”HS is meant to cut journeys between London and Birmingham from  hour and  minutes to  minutes.That sparked Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom to question the “viability” of HS and the whole business case of the line.The proposed route is expected to cut through parts of her South Northamptonshire constituency.A maximum speed of  mph could be imposed when trains travel through tunnels between the capital and Birmingham to cut the construction budget.Last year Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said that the second phase of the project connecting Birmingham to Leeds may never be built.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Psychologically, whys it so important to you to have him back The pair then explained they wanted their family unit to be reunited, with Nora saying: So we can go and visit him, and just to know that hes there.But viewers reacted angrily, with one saying: Richard Madeley really does ask some ridiculous  insensitive questions as an interviewer!Another added: Richard doesnt half ask some weird questions.One even called for Piers Morgan tofrom his holidays to take up the presenting role.The emotional interview today saw both women break down as they vowed not to give up searching for the pilot.A tearful Danielle said: If youve got hope, you shouldnt give up. He wouldnt stop searching for me.The young woman sobbed as she recounted desperately trying to ring her dads phone after receiving the news his plane had disappeared.Mr Ibbotsons we Nora added: We cant leave him out there on his own.She said she had been praying for the family of footballer Sala, since the tragedy had first unfolded.The grieving -year-old said:that football song - hes coming home. And he will, definitely.Nora said she had spoken to her husband - who had been flying for  years - before the flight took off, but said he had not raised any concerns about the weather or conditions.She said: He didnt raise any concerns to me about it - he said the weather was fine.The family has since launched a GoFund Me page to help fund the search for Mr Ibbotson - pleading “we need him home so that we are able to lay him to rest”.And they were given a huge boost by Kylian Mbappe, who donated £, to the search while Gary Lineker added £, to the fundraiser.The Air Accidents Investigation Branchstated the search had been brought to an end and the operation to raise the wreckage abandoned due to bad weather.But on Friday Sala’s family urged authorities to continue looking for the pilot’s body.They said in a statement: It is with infinite sadness that we confirm the identity of Emilianos body.We would like to thank you for all your signs of affection and support in what is the most painful time of our lives.Seeing the whole world mobilised to support us in our research has been an infinitely precious help. Thanks to you, we are now able to mourn our son, our brother.On this Friday morning, our thoughts go to David Ibbotson and his family, hoping that the authorities will do their best to find him.The wreckage was discovered by the AAIB and robots subs were used to pull the body out of the ft-deep water in as dignied a way as possible..The AAIB said: In challenging conditions, the AAIB and its specialist contractors successfully recovered the body previously seen amidst the wreckage.The operation was carried out in as dignied a way as possible and the families were kept informed of progress.Richards clunky interview is just the latest in a string of cringe-worthy quotes including telling Bill Clinton: I was in a similar position to you.

He has ample space to park his car behind me. I feel very distressed by all of this.At Stockport Magistrates Court Chapman admitted seven charges of driving without due care and attention and seven charges of failing to report an accident.He was disqualied from driving for six months and ordered to pay a £ fine.A neighbour said: Shes not the only person on the street to have crossed Clive Chapman. hes annoyed just about everyone with his pick-up truck and is a thorough nuisance.Someone nicknamed Victor Meldrew because of his grumpiness but the reality is he behaves like a spoilt child. Youd think a man of his age would know better.Victor Meldrew was a notoriously grumpy character in a BBC sitcom, who would regularly complain about neighbours.Prosecutor Victoria Norman said: The footage shows the defendant driving his vehicle a Nissan Naa - a large four by four pick-up truck style vehicle - into their street and reverse parking into the space next to her vehicle. He then drives forward hitting her vehicle on each of the seven occasions.She feels this is a result of parking disputes between them both and her getting home first and him struggling to find a parking space outside his house.The CCTV shows the defendant hitting her vehicle, getting out and having a little look and then going into his house, he never told her about the damage. There was damage to the paintwork.In mitigation defence lawyer Robert Stewart: It is always an unfortunate situation when we have a person of Mr Chapmans age before the courts. He is deeply disappointed and ashamed.He did not feel that failing to stop or failing to report was a serious offence at the time and he just though that she might have gone round to see him.Theres been a situation regarding parking where one party believes the other are parking outside their house and the other party believes its the other way around.He had no intention to cause any damage and the damage caused was very minor given the size of his vehicle.This is an isolated set of circumstances.

Like a deep grunting and snorting growl. I had never heard anything like it.“I had a choice, I could either go down the back with a torch and have a look, but something inside my head said let it go because I might not come back.”Dean’s second sighting became a lot more personal when he was out running one night in Queensland.He said: “In  I was living in a place halfway between Brisbane and the Gold Coast and I was going jogging, again about pm at night.“It was like someone creeping up on me, it was a stalking type motion, and then I was aware something was just behind me, and I got these chills I’ve never experienced in my le.”Dean said it took all his strength and courage to turn around and see a huge seven-foot-tall silhouetted Yowie standing there behind him just within the bush line.Dean said: “It was like nothing I had ever seen before in my entire le, I knew I had to move, and the moment I did this thing roared.“It was like a bear and a lion wrapped in one, this thing had a massive vocal capacity. And I was off, I was running.“It was smashing through the bush, and at the time I was a pretty fast runner, but this thing was a lot faster than me, and it was running through thick undergrowth.“I thought I was going to die, but then it started running ahead of me and so I veered away from the forest tree line.

Traditionally she has been one of Britain’s closest EU allies.Leading Brexiteers said the report proved why the PM must stand firm and carry through with her threat to leave without a deal in order to secure concessions from the EU.If Britain leaves without a deal then trade with EU countries would be based on World Trade Organisationrules.That would mean car imports would incur a  per cent tarf when they crossed the UK-EU border.The report warned: “In no other state is the effect on total employment as great as in Germany.”The authors added: “The employment effects of a hard Brexit would be noticeable above all at the automobile locations.”Worldwide, Germany accounts for about one in six of jobs at risk of a no deal Brexit.Some , jobs in EU member states will be affected - out of a total of , worldwide, according to the researchers.Leading Brexiteer and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “This tells you that the British government must not have in their minds the thought of giving in at this point because the pressure is now beginning to ramp up on the EU.“Despite all the pomp and nonsense, the reality will come down to jobs lost, business shut and tax paid.“That is the pressure now being applied in France and in Germany and where.“So the Government must stick now fully adopt the Malthouse compromise and tell the EU this is it or we leave without a deal.“Just watch how the pressure grows in the EU.”Vice chair of the Brexiteer ERG group Mark Francois said: “We want to trade successfully with our former EU partners, avoiding job losses on either side.However, the EU has historically sold us far more than we sell them, sothey refuse to compromise then they have much more to lose than us.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We have  days left, that solution needs to be found.”In a Brexit boost it was announced that the UK’s existing £ billion a year trading relationship with Switzerland will continue after Brexit.The two countries signed an agreement to rollover the current arrangements - but Switzerland is one of only two countries to strike a deal to carry on trading on the same terms. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The agreement, in two documents running to  pages, was signed off in a crunch EU summit on Sunday  November. But MPs were angry at the Irish backstop, a clause which will extend EU customs rules across the UK from it is needed to keep the Irish border open. Mrs May is now seeking to re-open the deal to replace the backstop with alternative arrangements, a time limit, or exit clause. But EU leaders are refusing to reopen it. So what exactly does the deal say and why are people so het up about it  Weve taken a closer look.  The Brexit deal is in two parts - both of which provoked a huge backlash. The first is the -page Withdrawal Agreement. This covers the UKs actual exit from the EU, and was agreed on November . The second is the -page Political Declaration on a Future Framework. This covers the shape of a future relationship and was agreed on November . If a deal isnt agreed, the UK will leave the EU on  March  with no deal. This is a  No Deal Brexit .  These agreements are only in principle and needed to be signed off by three groups. First there was the Cabinet. It agreed the deal but two Cabinet ministers - Dominic Raab and Esther McVey - resigned. Second - the deal needed to be signed off by  EU leaders at a Brussels summit on Sunday  November. Third and last - it needs to be signed off in a vote by MPs in Parliament. Theresa May lost that final vote by an absolute record landslide.  What are the main points and problems in the Brexit deal  Weve looked at each part of the deal and looked at the main elements and sticking points. . The Withdrawal Agreement The transition period can be extended until  - after next election  Weve signed up to a transition period that will continue pretty much all EU rules until December . Now this could be extended to December  - beyond the date of the next general election.   The transition period can only be extended once. And it would be done by the UK making a request before  June . This request would be considered by an arbitration . That  would have  UK members,  EU members and  independent member, chosen through a legal process. We dont know who theyd be. At least its better than the original text which only went up to the year xx. Eventhe transition period is extended we could still end up in a backstop. For more on that, read on...  Under the backstop - a backup plantheres no agreement for the Northern Ireland border - there COULD be checks on some goods between Northern Ireland and the UK. Theresa Mays DUP allies say this is unacceptable. Northern Ireland firms will access the EU Single Market as a whole without restriction. This will mean Northern Ireland will have to apply EU law on industrial, environmental and agricultural goods. And that means some of these goods would need checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. We need the EUs permission to quit the backstop  The backstop -it kicks in on  January  - will extend EU customs rules across the whole of the UK. This makes Brexiteers furious because it will stop us signing trade deals with the rest of the world - and lock us into Brussels rules without any say on them. Whats worse, we can only quit the backstopthere is mutual agreement between the UK and the EU. Senior UK officials insisted the EU would have to act in good faith. But thatll be cold comfort to Tory Brexiteers. European courts will still have a big hold on the UK  Any judgements from the European Court of Justice handed down during the transition period will be binding on the UK. And the arbitration  that resolves disputeswill not intervene in cases involving EU law. Instead the European Court of Justice will rule on those questions. . The Future Framework Weve lost frictionless trade... and would still be tied to EU rules in The document promises comprehensive arrangements that will create a free trade area - which isnt quite the frictionless trade we wanted. And even that will need deep regulatory and customs cooperation. It also calls for common principles in the fields of standardisation, technical regulations, conformity assessment, accreditation, market surveillance, metrology and labelling. Translation: Thats a lot of EU rules were agreeing to follow. Brexiteers are likely to fear this will mean tacking close to EU laws with little freedom to break themwe want good trade. We could have to allow access to our fishing waters  The document commits Britain to establishing a “new fisheries agreement on [among other things], access to waters and quota shares from  January . In other words - it kicks the can down the road. The government says it has defeated EU demands for reciprocal access to UK waters. But Brexiteers fear Britain will have to give up access to its waters to fishing from EU rivals infor a trade deal. Scottish Tory MP Ross Thomson said: “This means sovereignty over our waters sacriced for a trade deal. That is unacceptable. We must be a normal Independent coastal state like Norway.” And Tory Bernard Jenkin said: “It is going to enrage the coastal communities that we have conceded our fishing grounds and quotas.” Scottish Secretary David Mundell, however, threw his weight behind the deal, crushing claims he would resign. Wed stay tied to European courtsThe document the European Court of Justice would still have a role in interpreting EU law when it comes to law enforcement. This is a blow to Brexiteers, who want to quit the jurisdiction of the ECJ. Britain has long promised close co-operation on security - saying its top spooks make that an offer the EU cant refuse. But the document warns: The closer and deeper the partnership the stronger the accompanying obligations. Wed respect Europes human rights laws  The document commits the UK to respect the framework of the European Convention on Human Rights . Right wing Tories hate the convention which protects freedoms such as the prohibition of torture, slavery, the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression. Theresa May considered leaving the ECHR , in  but eventually decided it would not be possible while Brexit was underway. It was understood that she was going to make it a central plank of her re-election plan before calling an early election. But it underpins the Good Friday Agreement. Youll need a visa to go to the EU long-term  Visas wont be needed for short trips to the EU. But the document gives no such guarantee for long-term trips. This was widely expected, but will come as a blow to Remain campaigners . And finally... the whole thing is very vague  Take visas. What does a long-term trip mean  Take customs. What does deep co-operation mean  And more. Theres lots of very positive language but it kicks many cans down the road. Theresa May said she would aim for “associate membership” of European Medicines Agency. But that has been downgraded to exploring the “possibility of cooperation”. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: Its clear from this document that indeed nothing is agreed. This is the blindfold Brexit we all feared - a leap into the dark. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned the document was full of unicorns and adds up to a blindfold Brexit. Furious Mark Francois, of the Tory Brexiteer battalion, branded the deal a fig leaf that is not legally binding and wont fool anybody. He told the BBC: It is  pages of political camouflage designed to take peoples eye off the withdrawal agreement and persuade them to vote it through. It will not work. Theresa May has a Brexit deal, but the danger is looming that it will be defeated in the House of Commons. Even getting it past her Cabinet forced Esther McVey and Dominic Raab to resign. Now she faces one more hurdle - a vote in Parliament on December . MPs are grouped in several factions - their warring opinions are explained more fully here. But or more vote against the deal, they will defeat the deal. Against the deal TORY BREXITEERS: There are up to about , led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, threatening to vote down a deal that keeps Britain trapped in vassalage with Brussels. Not all are expected to live up to their threats. TORY HARD REMAINERS: Only about a dozen, but many - including Justine Greening and Jo Johnson - will vote against, instead wanting a second referendum. DUP: Theresa Mays Northern Irish allies - who she handed pound.bn - are -strong. They say they will vote down the deal. LABOUR LOYALISTS: About  MPs are consistently loyal to Jeremy Corbyn on Brexit. Theyll be told to vote against the deal because it doesnt meet Labours six tests. LABOUR REMAINERS: There are about  hard Remainer Labour MPs. Theyre likely to oppose the deal to avoid enabling a Brexit. OTHERS: The SNP , Lib Dems , Plaid Cymruand Greensare all likely to vote against. For the deal TORY LOYALISTS: Well over  are likely to vote with Theresa May, for the deal. Many have paid government jobs - so would have to quitthey oppose her. NERVOUS LABOUR: Some Labour MPs could BACK a deal - fearing otherwise Britain will be plunged into an even worse No Deal. There could be  or more. Caroline Flint is among them. Unknown LABOUR BREXITEERS: There are only about half a dozen. It was generally thought theyd side with Theresa May, but Kate Hoey MP broke ranks and said she could vote against."},{"url":null,"title":"hapless chris grayling accused taking","story":"NewsHapless Chris Grayling accused of taking shortcuts in Brexit ferries contract\"This minister is rewriting the textbook for ministerial incompetence in office.\"ShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  FEB News \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Hapless Tory Chris Grayling was accused of taking “shortcuts” in awarding a no-deal Brexit contract to a ferry firm with no ferries. Theresa May insisted she had full confidence in the Transport Secretary this morning.The Department for Transportsaid it had decided to terminate the contract after Irish company Arklow Shipping, which had backed Seaborne Freight, stepped away from the deal. But MPs - including pro-EU Tories - said Mr Grayling should take responsibility for the situation and resign. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: What began as a debacle has now descended into a Whitehall farce. This minister is rewriting the textbook for ministerial incompetence in office.   He said Mr Grayling chose to ignore warnings from MPs and industry, also claiming the Department for Transport took shortcuts in the procurement process with Seaborne Freight. Mr McDonald went on:points the finger at Arklow for the contract cancellation - is it really a good time to further insult the Irish  Mr McDonald asked how much cancelling the contract will cost taxpayers, adding: He simply cannot keep blaming others for his own mistakes. This disastrous decision sits squarely with him and his office. Isnt it the case that this Transport Secretarys approach to transport and wider Brexit contingency planning is off the Richter scale  And for the good of the nation, and for the sake of some semblance being restored to this shambolic Government, shouldnt he now do the decent thing and go   Mr Grayling replied to his Labour counterpart: I have to say that he brings a new meaning to the words utter hogwash.He clearly wasnt listening when I said weve spent no money on this contract. He defended his departments no-deal Brexit planning, adding the Seaborne Freight contract was assured jointly by DfT and Treasury officials. Mr Grayling quoted ata letter from Arklow Shipping which gave assurances over Seaborne Freight. In his initial reply to the urgent question, Mr Grayling earlier said there are contractual options to replace the Seaborne Freight capacity with additional capacity on routes in the North Sea and this is an option well be discussing across government in the coming days. Tory backbenchers queued up to defend the under-fire Transport Secretary in the Commons, with Robert Goodwilltelling MPs any suggested scandal was nonsense. He said: Weve heard a lot of nonsense about this company not owning any ships. Isnt it the case the majority of rail operators in this country dont own any trains and that many airlines... lease aircraft, which means not only do they not own the planes themselves but they dont employ the crew directly  Mr Grayling agreed and added: The fact is many members on those benches will go on holiday this year on airlines that own no planes because that is the way business works.

Gullible Labour MPs wanting to buy Mrs May’s unicorns should think again before voting for the Prime Minister’s bad faith deal. Downing Street’s confected assurances on workers’, consumer and environmental rights won’t be worth the paper that they’re written on. Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris inadvertently gave the game away during a gathering behind closed doors with  business, trade union and civic society leaders at the respected Institute for Public Policy Research.  Intended to be a no-notes frank discussion off the record, my snout heard Heaton-Harris cutting the ground from under the feet of opposition MPs toying with selling their votes to May for a few bob. Hardline Tory Brexit no-deal ideologues in fanatic Jacob Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group don’t object noisily to May’s proposed concessions to Labour, because once Britain is out of Europe, any commitments on jobs and other areas can be broken, explained Heaton-Harris. “The ERG are relaxed about it because it’s domestic, so they know they will be able to change it later – and evenit’s in the agreement, there won’t be any supervision or enforcement,” the Brexit Minister told the meeting. And he’s absolutely right.   Membership of the European Union prevents the Conservatives abolishing employment and social protections, such as guaranteed paid holidays hated by right-wing Tories plotting Brexit. The likes of Liam Fox, Jacob Rees-Mogg and UKIP partner-in-crime Nigel Farage dream of transforming our country into a rich man’s Treasure Island playground for the world’s elite. Slashing taxes on the wealthy, while simultaneously eroding the rights of the many and running down already-stretched public services, would be their plans for Brexit Britain. Shrewd Margaret Beckett, Labour’s wily former acting leader and Cabinet Minister, stated the obvious that May’s pledges are meaningless when she won’t be around for much longer. How valueless they are is underlined by Heaton-Harris candidly conceding that a large chunk, perhaps a majority, of Tory MPs don’t intend to keep them once we leave the EU. May’s letter to Corbyn mocking the Labour leader’s hostility to a potentially Brexit-saving second referendum is a PM laughing at her compromised opponent.

A Brexit deal was agreed between the UK and the EU, but it was voted down in the House of Commons. So with time running out, plans are being put into action in case a deal doesnt happen. The government has published  technical notices outlining the practical effects of No Deal - from driving licences to cats. Meanwhile ministers have , troops held at readiness, could call up Army reserves and declare martial law. Ministers could quit in protestNo Deal happens while supermarkets and hospitals are stockpiling food and medicine. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and troops couldto the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.   A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But businesses are not what whove written this guide for. Instead we have tried to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen. But youd better wise up...   What is a No Deal Brexit  No Deal is the default optionMPs, the EU and the UK government cant agree a Brexit Withdrawal Agreement by  March . The -page deal on the table will ensure businesses arent cut off by continuing rules in a transition period until December . But it comes at a cost - a backstop that could trap the UK in an EU customs union from . That means MPs have opposed it. Leaving with no deal will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increasing the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer . MPs believe they can find a way to block No Deal through Parliament - including by delaying the March  date - butthey dont its still the default option at pm on March .  More than , troops are being held at readiness in case there is a disastrous no-deal Brexit. Army reserves are also legally able to be called upthere is civil unrest, while councils are braced for possible runs on banks, fuel and food. Local Resilience Forums are reporting back to Whitehall and expect several months of disruptionthere is no deal. The government has plans in case it needs to impose martial law - military law - and curfews to restore order. Cabinet minister Matt Hancock admitted the plans existed but insisted the government was not specically looking at martial law and it was not the focus of our attention.  At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers to renew any passports older than nine years and six months. . Usually this means renewing six months before your passport expires. Butyour passport had more than  years validity, youll have to renew earlier, because the extra months on top of  years dont count. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There is a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad. Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport. The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners must visit a vet at least four months before taking their pet the EU. And because talks are ongoing, that means youd better book in now. The animal must have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days later, to prove the vaccination worked. Pet owners must then wait at least three months before visiting the vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts.  Food is being stockpiled forwe crash out of the EU without a deal, and ministers have promised an adequate supply. But thats not the same as having the range of food we do now. Leaked plans in December warned Brits could have to y their diet. And in January, big names KFC, Pret, Lidl, Co-Op, MS, Waitrose, Sainsburys, Asda and McDonalds signed a damning letter warning food supplies could run short because of disruptions to the supply chain. They wrote in a joint letter to MPs: Our ability to mitigate these risks is limited. As prudent businesses we are stockpiling where possible, but all frozen and chilled storage is already being used and there is very little general warehousing space available in the UK. They added: Retailers typically store no more than two weeks inventory and it becomes dficult to restock storesthe supply chain is disrupted.  A string of firms have either moved jobs out of the UK or are threatening to do so in a no-deal situation. Airbus, which employs , people in the UK with around , more jobs in supply chains, warned it may move where. Car plants are moving forward standard shutdowns to be around Brexit in case there are supply chain issues. And critics fear new investment will not come the UKs way, hitting jobs in generations to come.  Major motorways in the South of England are set for serious disruption in case of a no-deal Brexit. From early  the Mwill be closed as needed from junctions -, with a contraflow of both directions on the opposite side, so it can be used as a lorry parkthere is gridlock at Dover. A backup lorry park will be in place at Manston Airport. The M in Kent is also expected to be used as a holding area for lorries. And a similar fate could befall a -mile stretch of the M towards Southampton.  The International Air Transport Associationwarn up to million plane tickets could be cancelledthere is no deal. Currently it is not known exactly which tickets could be hit, or how passengers would find outthey are at risk. The situation arose because in a no deal, there will be no automatic legal basis for flights between the EU and UK after pm on  March . Under a pact struck between the UK and EU in December, basic connectivity will be maintained for a -month periodtheres No Deal. But according to the IATA - which represents  airlines including British Airways - that only means maintaining the number of flights in . It does not allow an increase in services - yet tickets have already been sold based on a predicted increase. Talks are ongoing, but Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, previously warned flights could be groundedgoodwill fails.  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you should get an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents were due to be sold at , post offices from February. Before they were sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Up to a million Brits may be forced to take a new driving test  British people driving in Europe could be forced to take a new driving testtheres a no deal Brexit. Up to a million Brits living in Europe were told to replace their driving licence with a local permit immediately. Guidance issued by the Department for Transport said: If you are aUKlicence holder living in theEUorEEAyou should exchange your UK driving licence for a local EU driving licence before  March . From that date, in the event that there is noEUExit deal, you may have to pass a driving test in theEU country you live in to be able to carry on driving there.  More than million EU citizens living in the UK will have less concrete rights to stay. Whether theres a Brexit deal or not, EU citizens can stay in Britainthey register for settled status with the government. But the rules are stricter in a No Deal Brexit. In No Deal, only EU citizens arriving before  March can apply, not those arriving by December . The deadline to apply will be  December , instead of  June there is a Brexit deal. And family members will only be able to join settled EU citizens in the UK before  March . As for the other way round - major EU nations have inidually said theyll allow UK ex-pats to stay, but this could y by country.  Pharmacists have requested special powers to ration medicinesthere is no Brexit deal. Under plans by the Healthcare Distribution Association, they would have special powers to y doctors prescriptions and offer something a drug is unavailable.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry. Government and NHS chiefs have set up a war room called the Operational Response Centre and industry firms are creating six-week stockpiles of medicine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has chartered a plane to fly in short-shelf-le products, like isotopes for cancer treatment, from Maastricht. Insulin could also be stockpiled. Mr Hancock claimed hes become the biggest buyer of fridges in the world, after fitting out facilities for storage of the crucial drugs. NHS staff are being directed to urge patients not to stockpile medicines personally to avoid shortages throughout the system.  Mobile roaming charges face an immediate hikethere is a No Deal Brexit, the government has confirmed. Tory ministers are revoking the EU law which guarantees UK citizens pay the same for using their phone on the Continent as they do at home. That will leave mobile phone firms free to hike costs whenever they like after the UK leaves. Guaranteed free roaming launched across the EU just  months ago - and meant big savings. But that guarantee will be scrappedthere is no deal, thanks to an obscure law laid before Parliament.  Eurostar services could be suspended in a worst-case no deal Brexit. The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea. Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned:Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive. . You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change  Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit. And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your everyday medicines and perfumes could become more expensive  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. And finally... your regular caviar parties are doomed!  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

Paddy, , as Rachaels schoolgirl crush. They were both pupils at the same secondary school in Manchester when she fell head over heels - but was too shy to speak to him. Although smitten Rachael, , did sent anonymous Valentines cards every year. After school, Rachael moved to New Zealand for two years and had son, Oliver, now seven.   But then in , she finally plucked up the courage to send Paddy a Facebook message. He replied instantly and their first date was just a week later. It was then that things started moving really fast. Rachael and Paddy bought their first house together just two weeks later, got married a few months later in the December and then had three babies in nine months. Rachael said: “People thought it was way too fast and told me it wouldn’t last, but I was sure we were meant to be together.   “I believe in love at first sight. I loved Paddy as soon as I saw him back at school, and still felt the same after years apart. If something feels right, you have to go for it.” After trying to forget about Paddy when they both left school a chance comment on Facebook in April  threw the couple back together. Racheal said: “I saw his profile pop up as he’d commented on a mutual friend’s post, so I had a look through his photos and plucked up the courage to message him. I said, ‘You haven’t changed a bit.’ “I wasn’t even surehe’d remember me, given that we’d never spoken. But he replied right away saying, ‘Neither have you.’” From there, Paddy and Rachael began to speak every day over Facebook, swapping tales about le, love, and everything in between.  After a week, he asked the question she’d longed to hear since she was a teenager – ‘Want to go on a date ’ Rachael said: “We’d arranged something for the following week, but in the end, we couldn’t wait. I ended up texting him a few days later when I was on a night out in Manchester city centre to seehe wanted to come and join me. “He did, and as soon as I saw him, it was like we’d known each other forever. Which we had, I suppose.” The spark between them clear to see, Paddy and Rachael spent virtually every day together from then onwards.  Then, two weeks later, he mentioned he was house-hunting, and suggested she join him for a viewing of a property near to where she was then living. She said: “He asked me what I thought of the place, and I told him I loved it. “Then he turned to me and said, ‘I don’t want to get it unless you move in too.’ “I thought, ‘Is he mad ’ It had only been two weeks. But part of me just knew it was right.” So, though her family and friends thought she was “nuts,” Rachael agreed, and the couple jetted off to Madrid the following week to celebrate. There, under the Spanish sun, they discovered the offer they’d put in had been accepted, meaning they ed to the UK to start their new le together. And just six weeks after that, in early July, Paddy had another important question for Rachael.  She said: “He proposed to me in Paris. It was like something from a fairytale. “People thought it was way too fast and told me it wouldn’t last, but I was sure we were meant to be together.” Shortly before their trip to France, Rachael had discovered she was pregnant, meaning she had gone from single to engaged and expecting within just three months. She was delighted but, sadly, things weren’t meant to be. At around  weeks, she went to hospital feeling dizzy, where a scan revealed she was experiencing a molar pregnancy. The condition occurs when a lump of abnormal cells, rather than a healthy foetus, grows inside the womb. In some cases, when the cells do not go away on their own, they can lead to a condition called persistent trophoblastic disease , which the NHS says is similar to cancer,untreated.  That meant that – heartbreakingly – Rachael’s ‘baby’ had to be removed. She said: “I couldn’t take it in. I had never even heard of a molar pregnancy.” Looking back, Rachael said she would never have got through the ordeal without Paddy, who she married that December in Paris, in front of  loved ones. She said: “We hired a boat afterwards and sailed down the Seine, past the Efel Tower. The way we saw it, we wanted to be together, so there was no point in waiting – even though we hadn’t even been together a year. When you know, you know.” In the wake of the molar pregnancy, Rachael feared the same thing could happen again and she would never be able to start the family with Paddy that they both so desperately wanted.  But then, in early  – a month after their wedding - she was pregnant again and the pair’s daughter Mollie, now two, was born that September. Just six weeks later Rachael was again - with identical twins. She said: “We couldn’t believe it. We were basically doubling the size of the family. “At first, I was terried about how we’d cope, but Paddy said it was like winning the lottery. “I knew then that we’d get through it together.” The babies, Niall and Luke, were born early in June , meaning Rachael had given birth three times in nine months – and the children will all be in the same school year, when the time comes.  She said: “It was hard work having three tiny babies. The twins had colic, so would cry a lot, then Mollie would wake up wanting a feed. Even getting out the house for five minutes took rigorous planning. We got a nanny to come and help two times a week, which was amazing. Plus Paddy was fantastic.” Incredibly, despite the fact she was taking the contraceptive pill, Rachael soon added to her brood once again, with baby Orla, who was born in November . Le for the Kirkwoods now is hectic but happy, with six children in the house when Paddy’s other son comes round on the weekends. Rachael’s own fairytale romance has even inspired her to set up a charity called Wish For A Wedding, which helps provide weddings to couples dealing with a terminal illness.  Given that she’s been through so many dferent types of pregnancies, she also wants to help others, and so has set up a blog called MumToBe, where she shares advice and candid posts, especially aimed at those who may feel isolated as they don’t have many friends with children. Now, as Paddy and Rachael have just celebrated their third wedding anniversary, she says she’s proved the cynics, who told her that her whirlwind romance would never last, well and truly wrong. She added: “I know we aren’t conventional, but I wouldn’t change the way we did things for the world. Paddy and I are like teenagers together, still as in love now as we were on day one. “I’ve never met anyone like him, and know that, given all we’ve been through and not been broken, I’ll be with him forever. “To anyone out there doubting whirlwind romances, I’d say this - If something feels right, go for it.”For more information on Rachael, visit www.wishforawedding or www.mumtobe or follow www.instagram the_kirkwood_triplets"},{"url":null,"title":"dad who woke after night","story":"NewsDad who woke after night of drinking to find his baby boy dead in bed spared jailJamie Lucas, , was given a two year suspended sentence at Newcastle Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to child cruelty by neglectShareByRob KennedyCourt ReporterDavid Coleman:,  FEB NewsJamie Lucas had pleaded guilty to child cruelty by neglect after little -week-old Frankie Lucas was found dead \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dad who woke up after a night of drinking to find his baby boy dead in bed beside him has been spared jail. Jamie Lucas, , was looking after -week-old Frankie and two other children at the time of the tragedy. Mr Lucas, who had drunk seven bottles of lager, some vodka and taken cocaine, fears he may have fallen asleep on the tot - but a court heard Frankies death could not be attributed to him. The father admitted child cruelty by neglect as a judge said the loss of his son will be a long-lasting punishment in itself, Chronicle Live reports. At Newcastle Crown Court, Lucas was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, with a  month night-time curfew. Judge Sarah Mallett, who said the case was tragic, told him: I note that the loss of your son will be an enduring punishment in itself, the impact of which cannot be minimised.   The court heard Frankies mother had gone out to her sisters for the night in November  and left Lucas in charge. She ed early the next morning to find Lucas asleep in bed with Frankie and another child.The baby was unresponsive and floppy next to his dads leg. The family, paramedics and hospital all tried to revive the baby, who had been recovering from bronchitis, but he was in cardiac arrest when he was found and could not be saved. Lucas, who couldnt remember putting Frankie in the bed, was in acute distress when he realised what had happened and immediately confessed he was in the wrong. Judge Sarah Mallett told him: You thought you must have lain on the baby. You said, and I accept, you had not intended to hurt your son. Judge Mallett added: Co-sleeping with a parent who has consumed alcohol and cocaine is acknowledged to be a major risk factor. The court heard the cause of Frankies death was unknown and judge told Lucas: It cannot be attributed to you.   But the judge added: You did have sole care at the time of two young children and a baby, the baby had been poorly. You knew he had respiratory issues and he was, therefore, obviously vulnerable. You deliberately engaged in that behaviour over a y period of time. It was obviously going to, inevitably, render you unable to care for the children and keep them safe, which was your responsibility. That is the neglect you fall to be sentenced for. It was more than a momentary lack of control, you knew you had sole charge for them that night and you did disregard their welfare. The court heard Lucas has demonstrated remorse from the start and has been left devastated by the loss of his son. Judge Mallett said: I agree this is a tragic case with devastating consequences for Frankie and for the whole family. Lucas was unemployed at the time but is now in work and has health problems. Paul Caulfield, defending, said: Its an absolute tragedy, not just for the little boy but for the entire family, who have been completely devastated by what has gone on. He is rightly described as being genuinely remorseful, the offence has affected his mental wellbeing considerably. Mr Caulfield said Lucas and his partner, who is sticking by him, have been described as caring parents. He added: He is to be dealt with for exposing his child to risk while under the influence of drink and drugs, which he bitterly regrets. He struggles to come to terms with what happened.

Kellie Wilson, , believes she is being snubbed by would-be employers because of her disability. Every job application she has made since the summer of  has resulted in a series of rejections. Now, she is so desperate that she is contemplating cochlear implants knowing that they may not even work. IT worker Kellie has tried for pub, housekeeping and pot washing jobs. But she told the Mirror: “I have lost out due to my deafness. “I am being discriminated against and treated unfairly.”   She has the GCSEs and a NVQ Level  in Business Administration. Single and living with her parents in Middleton Tyas, North Yorkshire, she would like to find work in software development. “Money to study and take exams are the problem,” she explained. “The only thing I cannot do is hear. “My mind is sharp and I can lip read really well.

She was killed by tiger , Asim, who arrived at the zoo late last month specically to be her mate. The two tigers had been kept in neighbouring enclosures since Asims arrival so they could get used to each others smell. But when staff introduced the pair this morning, Sumatran Melati was brutally killed within minutes. Now, London Zoos chief operating officer, Kathryn England, has revealed what happened when the two Big Cats met each other for the first time.   Kathryn has known ten-year-old Melati since she joined London Zoo in  and says Friday was one of the most dficult days of my career. She described Melati as beautul, majestic, spirited – and every inch a tiger. The expert explained Asim, seven, had been brought to London Zoo from Denmark as part of the Europe-wide breeding programme for Sumatran tigers. Kathryn said: We started the day in nervous anticipation, excited than our beautul Sumatran tiger, Melati, would have to chance to become a mum again. Asim and Melati had been kept side-by-side, but separated by mesh, since his arrival at the zoo.  The pair had been callng and chuffing to one another - a good sign. Kathryn said: Both seemed comfortable and even chose to eat their breakfast within feet of each other. Chuffing is a friendly noise that tigers use to greet each other, usually during courtship or when a mum is greeting her cubs. It indicates interest and curiosity. It might be the human equivalent of a saying “hello lovely, how are you ”. Occasionally the tigers will chuff at their keepers too, and those are moments they all treasure. Staff at the zoo, with more than  years of experience between them, had been carefully observing Melati and Asim and on Friday thought the time was right to properly introduce them to one another.  Kathryn said: Several people from outside the zoo have remarked that  days seems fast to introduce tigers to each other. It’s not – it’s wildly iable and depends entirely on careful observation of their behaviour. Conversely, it can be risky to leave tigers showing an interest in each other out of contact for too long, leading to a build-up of tension and frustration. In the run up to Friday, plans were careful drawn up - including precautions as to how they would reactall did not go to plan. The team had fire extinguishers, air horns and flares ready to distract the Big Catsneeded. They did have transquiliser darts but these can be hard to shoot woth accuracy and can take up to  minutes to take effect. Kathryn said: The perimeter of the exhibit was carefully walked and checked for anything out of place that could alarm the tigers.  The surroundings were quiet and calm. We opened the gate between the two enclosures and watched carefully. Initially everything about their meeting was as we expected. They watched each other, they were cautiously interested and they snfed the air for several minutes. But then things began to take a tragic turn and Kathry explained that part of tigers’ natural behaviour is territorial and aggressive, and they are strong and fast animals. Males often posture at females to show their dominance and both tigers swiped and reared up at each other. Then tragedy struck. Kathryn said: In the blink of an eye, with no obvious provocation, they turned on each other and our years of experience told us it was beyond normal.  The initial skirmish lasted a few seconds and we were already reacting. Asim started to retreat and we were poised to close the gate when Melati lashed back out at him. He overpowered her in a split second. Everyone sprang into action lighting flares, sounding airhorns and setting off fire extinguishers and hoses. Unfortunately by the time Asim retreated the second time and we could close the gate, Melati had been fatally injured. It took moments. Everyone was numb with shock, and the sheer disbelief was palpable. As soon it was safe our vets ran to Melati with every hope they might yet save her, and even these experienced professionals of the zoo world were entirely distraught to find they couldn’t. Staff had to turn their attention to Asim, who had also been through an ordeal. Kathryn stressed the breeding programme was key because of the very real threat of extinction that tigers are facing.  She said: Melati had a crucial role here generating advocacy for a species that is perilously on the brink a role that she was clearly fulfilling gauging by the reaction to her passing. I would love to see this awful moment trigger a greater understanding of the challenges faced by her species in the wild. Melati contributed to a more secure future for tigers, not only through her cubs but through the affinity she built with our many visitors – reinforcing why zoos like ours play such an important role in the future of wild animals. Upset animal lovers have expressed their horror following Melatis death on Twitter . Lauren Hickling wrote: As a regular visitor of Melati, we went last weekend in fact, I am very sad to hear of this awful news. Lib With Attitude added: This has brought tears to my eyes on the train. Melati was so beautul. And Samantha Smith said: My daughter is absolutely devastated. Melati was a beautul tigress. Rainbow Kitty wrote: Such a sad loss of a beautul creature. RIP Melati, over the rainbow bridge. Zookeepers had flown to Denmark to get to know the male Sumatran. At the time they said: We learned that he adores chicken and loves to play, particularly by pouncing on piles of empty boxes sprayed with strong scents such as herbs and spices. Melati had previous cubs, born at London Zoo. But tragically, in , one of her cubs died when it was just two weeks old. It had been the first tiger to be born at the zoo in  years. Melati went on to have a second litter of cubs in .

The family are again caught up in a storm after their dad, Thomas, , published extracts from a letter Meghan wrote to him after their wedding. Snippets released from the five-page note showed Meghan, , telling Thomas Markle that he had broken her heart “into a million pieces”.   And referring to Samantha, Meghan wrote: On a daily basis you ﬁxated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know… you watched me silently suffer at the hand of her vicious lies, I crumbled inside. She accused her dad of lying about her and Prince Harry in press stories, and family members say their relationship is now damaged beyond repair . Heartbroken Meghan also criticised Thomas for exploiting her relationship to the royal in extracts published by the Mail on Sunday . Now her half-sister Samantha told The Sun that he is prepared to release more of it.   She said: It is nasty. Dad is prepared to release more of it. She claims despite not changing her number, her father has not attempted to call her or message her. The Duchess also slams Mr Markle for siding with her half-sister Samantha, who has attacked her in the press while she silently suffers at the hand of her vicious lies. Last week People magazine revealed the letters existence, and anonymous friends of Meghans said they were concerned the emotional trauma of dealing with her dad could have a negative effect on her baby.  They said she was so upset by her fathers public attacks on her and Prince Harry that she wrote the anguished letter begging him to patch up their dferences privately. In retaliation, Mr Markle released parts of his daughters letter publicly, calling it hateful. Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Jnr, , said: “There’s no trust between them. The relationship is broken beyond repair. It’s so sad to see.” The full extracts from Meghans five-page letter released so far Daddy, It is with a heavy heart that I write this, not understanding why you have chosen to take this path, turning a blind eye to the pain you’re causing. Your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces — not simply because you have manufactured such unnecessary and unwarranted pain, but by making the choice to not tell the truth as you are puppeteered in this. Something I will never understand. You’ve told the press that you called me to say you weren’t coming to the wedding — that didn’t happen because you never called. You’ve said I never helped you ﬁnancially and youve never asked me for help which is also untrue you sent me an email last October that said: ‘If I’ve depended too much on you for ﬁnancial help then I’m sorry but pleaseyou could help me more not as a bargaining chip for my loyalty.’  I have only ever loved, protected, and defended you, offering whatever ﬁnancial support I could, worrying about your health... and always asking how I could help. So the week of the wedding to hear about you having a heart attack through a tabloid was horrying. I called and texted... I begged you to accept help — we sent someone to your home... and instead of speaking to me to accept this or any help, you stopped answering your phone and chose to only speak to tabloids. If you love me, as you tell the press you do, please stop. Please allow us to live our lives in peace. Please stop lying, please stop creating so much pain, please stop exploiting my relationship with my husband... I realise you are so far down this rabbit hole that you feelthere’s no way out, butyou take a moment to pause I think you’ll see that being able to live with a clear conscience is more valuable than any payment in the world. I pleaded with you to stop reading the tabloids. On a daily basis you ﬁxated and clicked on the lies they were writing about me, especially those manufactured by your other daughter, who I barely know… you watched me silently suffer at the hand of her vicious lies, I crumbled inside. We all rallied around to support and protect you from day , and this you know. So to hear about the attacks you’ve made at Harry in the press, who was nothing but patient, kind, and understanding with you is perhaps the most painful of all.  For some reason you choose to continue fabricating these stories, manufacturing this ﬁctitious narrative, and entrenching yourself deeper into this web you’ve spun. The only thing that helps me sleep at night is the faith and knowing that a lie can’t live forever. …I believed you, trusted you, and told you I loved you. The next morning the CCTV footage came out. You haven’t reached out to me since the week of our wedding, and while you claim you have no way of contacting me, my phone number has remained the same. This you know. No texts, no missed calls, no outreach from you — just more global interviews you’re being paid to do to say harmful and hurtful things that are untrue.

The Green Mans bar and benches are still intact, along with giant murals depicting scenes of castles and knights. The entrance to the ale house was closed  years ago and its doors later walled up during renovation work at the shopping centre, the Loughborough Echo reports .  At the time, Carillon Court bosses said it would cost too much to create a new access, so the boozer may never be used again. The Green Man closed its doors for the last time in . It covers the basement under four stores – from the entrance to the Game store.  On its walls are three huge murals painted by artist David Parry which have remained untouched.  There is also a bag of peanuts dating from , as well as scores of empty beer glasses. Since it closed, potential developers have viewed the site but decided against taking it on. Speaking at the time, Baljit Kooner, Carillon Court manager, added: “Developers looked at it a couple of years ago, but they were put off by the cost.  “At the moment the pub trade is declining, lots of them seem to be being bought by Tesco to make them into Express stores.  “But I don’t think even Tesco would want to put a shop down there. The whole place looks like a castle inside, the pictures are very impressive. “It is also pretty clean as well – there are not as many cobwebs as you’d think.” "},{"url":null,"title":"terrifying new technique burglars using","story":"NewsTerrying new technique burglars are using to break into homes - how to avoid itThere have been a spate of break-ins using the technique in the north of England, and police are increasingly worriedShareCommentsByZoe ForseyActing Audience EditorRosaleen Fenton:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsPolice are worried about the new trend \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPolice are becoming increasingly worried about a terrying new technique burglars are using to break into peoples homes. Two men wearing balaclavas were caught on camera using a blow torch to burn off the locks on the front door of a family home in Bradford. Once inside they grabbed a set of car keys and stole a pound, Audi S Quattro - even using the torch to defrost the windscreen before driving off. Police say the technique is becoming increasingly common as thieves come up with new and unusual ways to break into properties. The latest incident, which happened at am in the morning, follows a spate of similar crimes across the north of England. Police believe criminals are targeting homes with PVC doors, melting the locks to gain entry to the property.   Taira Abdul-Khaliq, , who owns the car in the latest incident, said police had been unable to find any evidence at the scene due to the burnt out locks. She said: Im so angry, its unbelievable. Im off work at the moment because Im furious. Its a violation. They came in with blowtorches. I work in a local school and theres not many women who drive high-powered cars so lots of people know who I am. We were advised by police thatburglars break in, theyll come and wake you up for car keys and they might hurt you. So every night, we leave the keys on the stairs so they dont come and threaten us.   And thats exactly what they did, they searched our coats, stole our wallets and then started coming upstairs. Last April, police in Bradford warned of at least eight incidents where a blowtorch was used to gain access to a house. Other burglaries involving the flame-throwers have been reported in Sedgefield and Newton Ayclfe, County Durham, and Sutton-in-Craven and Crosshills, north Yorkshire and Keighley and Bingley, west Yorks. As the pair drove away, Tairas phone briefly connected with her cars dash cam and recorded the burglars comments as they realised the windscreen was iced up. Clearly unable to see, one of them can be heard saying: Lighter...get the lighter. Stick your head out of the window man! Teacher Taira added: Its just a few seconds but I can hear their voices and theyre local. Its so upsetting, it could be anyone I know. My neighbours CCTV captures them using the blowtorches down the road to defrost the windscreen.   I couldnt believe it when I saw it. That car was beautul. Everything I had I put into that car - I dont drink, smoke or go out clubbing. As long as I had my car, I was happy. It was a beauty, theres no car like it. My husband and I have been trying for children for a long time and I went for IVF. I had a horric experience where it went wrong and they found a cm polyp which they had to test for cancer. After that, when I received the all clear, I said to my husband that I was going to treat myself and this was my gt. Craven Inspector Geoff Crocker urged homeowners to update outdated locks and review their home security.   He said last year: I want to reassure the public that we are doing everything we can to apprehend the criminals who are committing these crimes. I would also recommend that residents review their home security arrangements and consider having snapsafe locks fitted to external doors front back and patio doors. Julie McCulloch, from Keighley, was one of those targeted last May. Thieves melted the door of her family home in a bid to steal her sons week-old Audi A. Although they left empty-handed, the -year-old said at the time: They are just horrible. Its awful. Im shaken up, but relieved they didnt get in.

His mother desperately tried to save him before collapsing from shock. Footage now shows the funeral prayer for his little boy as his father is comforted by Sheikh Amri. A video then shows the small boys body, enshrouded in a green cloth, being carried in a funeral procession. Shia Rights Watch, a Washington DC-based campaign group, said: There was no intervention from anyone and no response from authority thus far. The Saudi Shia community came together in mourning and to show solidarity with the parents. The community also reported this incident is a result of ongoing violations and lack of protection by the Saudi authority toward its Shia population.  Saudi Shia have been under military crackdown by their government and many Shia are in prisons and on death toll. But Saudi Arabias predominant branch of Islam is Sunni, accounting for around three quarters of the population. Human rights groups say practitioners of other forms of the faith - including Shia - are persecuted.

Kicking could do with improving, however.James HorsfieldAnother loanee, -year-old Horsfield is eager for game time after not featuring much for Scunthorpe this season.The former Man City kid, who has trained under Pep Guardiola, Manuel Pellegrini and Patrick Vieira, has shown a steady start at right-back both with the ball and defensively.Ryan McGowanThe Australian international has slotted in no problem at all and immediately strengthened the Dundee backline.Two strong performances already at centre-back, once he gets more settled there’s more to come.Andrew DaviesThe former Ross County skipper hasn’t had much luck in his time at Dens, breaking his foot in his first bounce game after signing.Injuries have been a feature of his career but all reports of his time in the Highlands and down south suggest, when he’s fit, he’s a strong leader at the back.Andreas HadeniusNot much was known about the big Swede before he signed for the Dark Blues just over a fortnight ago.We still don’t know too much but he’s shown in his two starts so far that he’s a ball-winner in the middle of the park who keeps possession ticking over.Ethan RobsonParent club Sunderland rate this kid highly and Jim McIntyre admitted he was surprised to be able to get the midfielder in on loan.His debut at Hamilton on Saturday largely passed him by before picking up a groin issue that kept him out of the - draw at Kilmarnock.Once up to speed, the hope is Robson can begin to realise the potential plenty down south recognise.John O’SullivanAnother loanee largely unknown up here, O’Sullivan made a fleeting debut at New Douglas Park last weekend.Andy DalesThe winger has made an impressive start to le up here. His direct, pacy running has caused defences plenty of problems but his final ball looks certain to frustrate Dees.Exciting player, though, and an asset to the team.Scott WrightThe talented forward hasn’t been able to push his way into Derek McInnes’ first team at Aberdeen yet and has joined Dundee to prove himself at this level.He’s fast becoming a favourite at Dens after a super goal at Hamilton and an impressive first-half showing against Kilmarnock.Craig CurranA frontman Jim McIntyre knows very well from his time at Ross County, Curran has shown he’ll work tirelessly and keep defenders honest. A tidy knock-down for the opening goal against Killie, too. More of that and the Dark Blues will be happy.Andrew NelsonWe were told the young striker was raw but full of talent and he’s shown that already. Three goals in five appearances have rocketed him to second-top scorer already this season but even when not scoring he gives defences a real headache.Will need support but already looks a real find."},{"url":null,"title":"no thanks dundee fans group rejects owners bid for full control of club","story":"Dundee’s most influential supporters group has politely knocked back a bid from Dark Blues owner Tim Keyes to take complete control at Dens Park.Last month it emerged the American millionaire wanted to buy the Dundee FC Supporters’ Society’s ‘A’ Ordinary Shares to take his overall stake in the club to over %.That would have ended the DFCSS’s power of veto over matters like a change of ownership, merger, moving to a new stadium and even substantial borrowing.That’s a condition of the sale of the majority holding Texas-based Keyes took on back in .Only the ‘A’ Ordinary shares that were created then, and are held by the society, include that power of veto.After consulting their -plus members, however, the society have given a thanks but no thanks to the plan for them to be sold.In doing so, however, they have stressed their support “in principal” for the plan to move to a new stadium near the city’s Campderdown Park.And they have stressed their willingness to consider any proposal from Dundee on its merits.The decision of the society’s board reflected the feedback after consulting members.Of that number just over half indicated a preference for holding onto the ‘A Ordinary’ shares but were willing to see a relaxation of certain rights to allow the stadium development to go ahead.Some % were in favour of maintaining the status quo, while % were willing to see the shares sold and a new shareholders agreement negotiated.Another issue is the fact while the existing rules of the DFCSS allow them to buy shares, there is no provision for the sale of any they hold.As well as informing their members, the society board have told Dundee of their decision. It’s one that could leave Keyes and Dundee-based managing director, John Nelms, less than impressed,not surprised.They’ve previously stated the proposed increase in shareholding would have resulted in major tax benefits as they press ahead with the planned Camperdown move.As they informed members and the club of their decision, the society expressed the opinion they’re acting “in the best interests of the society as a whole”.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback. Inverness were three up and on easy street after a crazy opening  minutes which saw United gt-wrap the game. But a Lawrence Shankland inspired comeback almost grabbed a share of the spoils for Ian McCalls title contenders. A relieved Robertson said: Had it finished - you wouldnt have been surprised. Somerset Park is one of these grounds that sucks you inyou give them a snf. Its a good throwback and their fans make it intimidating and a good atmosphere for teams when you lose a goal. Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

Alan McConnell, , admitted the offence when he appeared in Ayr Sherf Court. McConnell was drinking at home with his partner on December  last year. But at some point he left the address, in Prestwick’s Raith Avenue, said depute fiscal Lindzi Bayne. His partner went looking for him at a nearby corner shop, but he had driven off so shop staff contacted police. McConnell’s car was traced to Drongan, and he admitted he had driven there. The charge against him stated he drove on roads between Raith Avenue, Prestwick and Coronation Road, Drongan. A breath test revealed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath. The legal limit in Scotland is  microgrammes. The court heard that McConnell had been ‘just over’ the limit in an earlier drink-driving conviction. Defence lawyer John Gallagher said his client was well aware he could be sent to jail this time. However, he made a plea for a sentence of unpaid work on his client, now of Lane Crescent, Drongan. Sherf John Montgomery told McConnell: “You were driving at five times over the prescribed limit. “If you ever offend again like this, it is inevitable you are going to jail.” He imposed a four-year-driving ban on McConnell, and ordered him to do  hours of unpaid work in the community, within six months. There was another crumb of comfort for McConnell when the sherf refused a Crown motion to seize his car, worth pound.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrCourtsAlcoholDrink-drivingJusticePrestwickAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"retired girvan bank boss admits","story":"NewsRetired Girvan bank boss admits drink-driving offencesNeighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  FEB NewsWilliam Fairbairn is disqualied from the roads for three years\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA retired bank manager was lucky not to be jailed after admitting two drink-driving offences. Neighbours had seen William Fairbairn drinking in his garage before driving, Ayr Sherf Court heard. Sherf John Montgomery told him: “That would normally mean a custodial sentence. I note your previously unblemished record.” The sherf instead imposed a fine of pound on Fairbairn, and banned him from driving for three years. Depute fiscal Lynda Carnochan described how an anonymous person phoned police on Tuesday afternoon, August , , around .pm. An hour later, police traced a blue Audi car to Rodney Drive in Girvan, and Fairbairn was still in the vehicle. His speech was slurred, said Ms Carnochan. But due to health problems, he struggled to give a breath test.   However, a blood test revealed he had  milligrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of blood, when the legal limit is  milligrammes. Just two months later, on October , , police on mobile patrol saw Fairbairn driving a Vauxhall Corsa. “They were aware of anonymous reports that he was driving while drinking,” said Ms Carnochan. “They followed him into The Avenue, but he did not stop when police flashed lights at him. He then turned into Rodney Drive, and drove past his own address. However he was eventually stopped.” A breath test was this time successful on Fairbairn. And iot showed  microgrammes of alcohol in  millilitres of breath when the legal limit is  microgrammes. Solicitor Hugh Duncan said Fairbairn had retired from the Bank of Scotland in  on a pension of pound per week.   He used his car to visit his -year-old mother, who is resident in a care home, added the lawyer. “The second matter, within such a short space of time, shows there is an issue with alcohol,” Mr Duncan admitted. “His we tells me his drinking is being curtailed. He was hospitalised with a gallstone, and he suffers from COPD.” Sherf Montgomery fined Fairbairn pound on the first charge, with a  months disqualication. He added an pound fine and a three-year disqualication on the second charge. Fairbairn, of Rodney Drive in Girvan, agreed to pay the pound total within  days. His disqualications will run concurrently, making a total of three years, but the Crown made no move to seize the family cars.

Hat Day, which takes place on Friday, March .The event is expected to smash all records as it marks its th year.Chloe and Oscarrsquos dad Matt was diagnosed after collapsing at home with an aggressive and incurable glioblastoma multormebrain tumour.Despite undergoing surgery and chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment, Matt passed away less than two years later, aged , in March , not long after his

months.\"The grieving process for me started  months before Matt died as the two of us came to terms with the idea that we were not going to have the le together we planned.\"I spent a lot of time listening to a playlist we compiled which represented our  years together.ldquoNow I am doing my best to give our children the childhood we had planned together.ldquoI am so proud of Oscar and Chloe for being part of the Wear A Hat Day campaign.\"It means so much to my family and me to help contribute towards a cure, so itrsquos an honour to have them take part.

Brain tumours kill more children and adults under the age of  than any other cancer yet, historically, just one percent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease Brain Tumour Research is proud to be changing this.ldquoThe sad truth is that brain tumours are indiscriminate and can affect anyone at any age and this means the impact on families is enormous. Too many children are losing siblings, parents and grandparents, too many parents are enduring the agony of their childrsquos diagnosis, and society as a whole continues to bear the burden of increased costs through the NHS, lost taxes, and demands on the benefits system.Wear A Hat Day has raised over a million pounds since the launch of Brain Tumour Research  years ago.The big day will

step in to prevent Theresa May from running down the clock before the Brexit date.The Labour MP said that Parliament will have to intervene with a ldquohard stop over concerns Mrs May will attempt to leave MPs with a choice of accepting her deal or crashing out of the European Union without any agreement.Speaking in Dublin ahead of a series of meetings with unions, business and political leaders, Sir Keir again called on Mrs May to have a vote on the customs union.Referring to her letter to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Sir Keir said the key question is whether Mrs May is prepared to move her red lines on the Brexit deal.In her response in the letter, the Prime Minister said she wanted the Tory and Labour teams to consider ldquoalternative arrangements to the Irish backstop.ldquoThe point of the exercise is to say there is a majority for a close economic relationshipyou are prepared to try to find it and I said we should test that by having a vote on the customs union, Sir Keir said.ldquoThe Labour Party has some concerns about the backstop but we absolutely accept that itrsquos inevitable that we need a backstop. At this stage of the exercise, the Article  window is almost being closed now so we need a backstop.ldquoThe letter was an agreed letter that was sent out. The critical question is, is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not and thatrsquos what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.ldquoThe critical thing is which direction is the Prime Minister heading in. Is she firstly trying to get her own team back on board to put her deal yet again with some supposed changes, and thatrsquos what looks like she is doing, or is she genuinely looking to see a majority for Labourrsquos proposal of a customs union single market alignment.He also expressed concerns over the backstop arrangement and in particular the customs arrangements for England, Scotland, Wales saying they ldquoarenrsquot as good as they should be.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting Belfast He added: ldquoI am concerned that with  days to go the Prime Minister is simply running down the clock, mindful that the next EU Summit is March  andshersquos is trying to run the clock down Parliament has to step in with a hard stop to say we are not going to accept that.When asked his view on Labour Party colleagues calling for a second referendum, Sir Keir said: ldquoI say we have got a conference motion on this, we agreed in advance what we would do and we tried to foreshadow the decisions we would have to make and we thought we would have to vote on a deal first,the deal goes down there would be a general election.ldquoIf there canrsquot be a general election then options including a public vote should be on the table. Thatrsquos what the Labour Party agreed and we agree unanimously and I think there is a good deal of support for that in the Labour Party.Sir Keir met with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents workers across the island of Ireland, before he spoke with Irelandrsquos Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.Owen Reidy, the unionrsquos assistant general secretary, said that workers on the island of Ireland cannot be ldquocollateral damage in Brexit.Mr Reidy said: ldquoItrsquos really important that a consensus is built across the House of Commons but a credible consensus that also gets the assent and agreement of the EU. Thatrsquos the critical issue here.ldquoOur view is Theresa May should look across the benches at the Labour Party and reach the softest possible Brexit and jettison the ERGand try and make accommodation with Keir Starmer and his colleagues who it seems to me are announcing a very soft Brexit with a UK-wide customs union and a close alignment with the single market.

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it.

bright yellow bus was not in keeping with the historic site and a lack of detail about how the venture would operate.But the council planning officerrsquos report noted: ldquoThe proposed bus for use

states that permission has been given for two years, although this could be extended.The historic auction mart was traditionally a bustling agricultural centre for East Linton.However, in recent years it has been transformed and become home to The Mart Farm Shop and Cafe and also Viarama, which is Scotlandrsquos first virtual reality company and social enterprise.In addition, regular farmersrsquo

Iniably I reply that there is no question of \"\", it is only a question of \"when\" but that depends on a great many iables.So my response to a question on January  on Good Morning Scotland was that wersquore not yet ready for a fresh referendum because there are too many practical questions as yet unanswerable precisely because of the shambles Westminster is inflicting upon us. That our collective patience is rapidly running out is completely understandable, given the mess the UK Government and the official opposition have put us in, but this is precisely the time for cool heads to prevail and recognise that we need to know what Brexit will look like before we make our next, decisive move.I refuse to accept the  equivalence between Brexit and independence that our political adversaries are increasingly peddling. The main reason Brexit is so dficult is because its proponents, Tory and Labour alike, simply cannot agree on what the term means and what the future should look like. If you donrsquot know where yoursquore going and how to get there, then of course the leaving process will be dficult!That is where independence is dferent. Independence is about principle, but also practicalities. It behoves us as serious people to explain in detail to folk how le will change and how le will stay the same. The deeply dishonest Leave campaign has shown us what happens when such a change is considered without any detail or indeed bearing with the world as it exists.In , we put a realistic and detailed proposition before the people of Scotland. We will do so again next time. We cannot put the same proposal forward for two reasons, firstly because that proposal was rejected and secondly because the landscape is likely to be very dferent due to the material change that Brexit represents.Crucially, our proposal was predicated upon all the nations of these islands being in the EU,the rest of the UK does leavethen we will need a dferent proposal. Only once the current uncertainty has dissipated can we can lay out the detailed proposition people have a right to expectwe are to ask them to put their trust in us.Crucially, this proposal must be based on reality. The key reason why over the last two years Brexit has been such a grotesque spectacle is that, from the beginning, the Leave campaign has been utterly ignorantof the most basic realities of the modern world and the relationships between states. Our independence proposition must be ndash and will be ndash based on facts and reality.Through no fault of our own, there is still too much uncertainty about the future relationship of the UK and the EU, which an independent Scotland will be part of. Like Ireland, independent in Europe, we cannot pretend that Brexit is just a British thing and that independence will immunise us from it.We have a land border with only one country, and in our interconnected world Brexit will still be relevant to us. And not all negatively, indeed an independent Scotland within the EU will be an incredibly attractive place to relocate to. Just how much more attractive has not yet dawned on many folk, but it will.As I travel the country, my sense is that a good proportion of people who were unpersuaded in  are now much more open to the independence question, but many are not with us yet and they have real questions that need real answers. ldquoWersquoll sort it out later will lose them before we start. We are not yet able to provide them, through no fault of our own, but we will be soon.I suspect the clarity we need will come quickly when it comes, and the broken Union we are part of will visibly have a lot less going for it than independence in Europe.In the meantime, there is plenty of planning that we must be getting on with ndash and we are. The good news is that we can already be certain of a great deal. Scottish independence will mean being part of the EU and being part of Nato it will mean being open and welcoming to anyone who chooses to make Scotland their home it will mean ramping up our already substantial efforts in international development co-operation and help those less fortunate it will mean leading the way in clean, renewable energy it will mean equal opportunities and access to healthcare and education for all our citizens. Any Brexit will be inferior.So Brexit affects independence for now, we recognise that, but independence does not depend on and will in no way resemble Brexit, provided we keep our cool just a little while longer. People up and down the country are keen for conversation.Many are disquieted by the UK they thought they knew suddenly looking and sounding very dferent to how it did, and are thinking hard about independence. We donrsquot have all the answers yet, that is the reality of our situation and it is an honest and open stance to take. But there is nothing stopping us having the discussions.We can mobilise, we can be visible and open about the challenges we face. We might not have a date, because we do not have a proposition yet, but we already have the biggest part of the answer ndash our passion for a better future than the one Westminster is offering us."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  After making demands she couldn t accept  Corbyn has made Theresa May an offer she can   t refuse","story":"Last week, Corbyn made a remarkable overture to the Prime Minister.

Finance Secretary Derek Mackay has stated that the NHS quite rightly is automatically exempt, but also that only other public service workers such as teachers be considered for exemption too. At what point does someone in office decide on any particular occupation to be prioritised over others  Is the tax to be based on the number of car parking spaces at a workplace whether lying used or vacant, andonly active spaces are in the equation, then the workers just park in the closest free space to their work and no tax is due. Perhaps non-exempt employers should just consider ploughing over their car parks and plant trees to boost our woodland percentage and at the same time avoid this taxWhy are governments not just honest enough to admit to this little wheeze to draw in more cash on the pretext of getting cars off the road and everyone on to our expensive and inefficient public transport system, which may not even service the many workplaces to be affected George Dale, Oakwood Drive, Beith.IT looks overwhelmingly likely that Derek Mackay was forced to make a number of last-minuteconcessions to the Greens to secure passage for his budget. The workplace parking tax has all the appearance of one which was thought through badly,at all.Efforts to reduce car travel to work are sensible in themselves, but measures which penalise some workers, such as those in our health services, who are not all that well paid in the first place and who may have to work awkward and unsocial hours, do more damage than good.This is a good example of a regressive tax that is, one which most badly affects those least able to afford to pay it. As a fair compromise perhaps our government could ensure that, where health workers have to pay to park, the parking vultures are allowed to charge them only as much as they would otherwise have had to pay in additional tax had the parking been free.

Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them.

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution.

If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

Whether it’s our personal information on social media or important financial details, it’s vital that we’re aware of how to keep our safe and secure from cyber criminals.”“By really getting under the skin of these hackers, our Cyber Sense workshops can point out how to understand how these iniduals work. Through the games we’ve designed, attendees will be able to competitively play roles on both sides of a cyber-crime. This offers a unique perspective that can show just what preventative measures can be taken to outsmart these online criminals.”To learn more about the Cyber Sense on Tour event and to book a free place, visit www.hellodigital.scot cyber-sense- copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials.

Highland Council has not asked the Scottish Government for support in relation to St Clementrsquos.Christyna Ferguson, whose daughter suffering a series of complex health issues including autism attends the school, slammed the councilrsquos inaction \"utter contempt for the already disadvantaged, vulnerable children\".She said: \"The Highland Council repeatedly told us that St.Clementrsquos appalling lack of facilities was due to a lack of Scottish government funding. Therefore it is misleading at best and shows not only non-compliance with their statuary obligations but utter contempt for the children.\"In the last year the Highland Council has taken no action to survey sites, secure funding or build a business plan despite assuring us they would.\"She insisted: ldquoHighland Council does have options in terms of funding solutions but they repeatedly refuse to engage in the process ndash again failing in their statutory obligations and causing unnecessary suffering and detriment to disabled children. It is incomprehensible to me that those with the power and the obligation in law can show such blatant disregard for disabled children.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes said: \"As the daughter of a former teacher at St Clementrsquos, I am in no doubt as to the poor condition of the buildings. It is remarkable the teachers are able to care for and teach the pupils in such a damp, cramped building.ldquoThere is a desperate need for a new building, delivered in consultation with parents and teachers. This is, of course, a matter for Highland Council who are statutorily responsible for school buildings but I think everybody wants to see a solution.\"I am more than happy to work with anybody and everybody to find a solution and would sincerely hope that wersquore not still talking about school buildings in another  years.\"Childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd, also a Ross-shire-based SNP MSP, said: \"The school has not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans despite being in a poor condition.\"Itrsquos nearly a year since I first raised concerns with the council so I look forward to meeting with councillors and officers at the end of this month to hear an update on progress.

That is why it is vital that we can find the right solution for the pupils, parents and the wider St Clementrsquos community.A Highland Council spokeswoman said: \"At this point in time we are addressing our capital plan for next year and the process is still ongoing.

Billy Mitchell, a flute band member who amassed  votes when standing for UKIP locally in , appeared previously in Kilmarnock and twice in Stirling, managing to ask a question hostile to the SNP each time. Amazingly, he then managed a fourth appearance in Motherwell and once again was picked to ask a question accusing the SNP of hypocrisy for offering no ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ option during the Scottish independence referendum. Surprisingly though, it wasn’t that robust rant that grabbed the headlines.Instead of featuring his anti SNP question, most papers focused instead on the frequency of Mitchell’s appearance, with the Sun observing it was “a feat so unlikely that bookies would give odds of several thousand to one against it happening.”That’s very signicant.Normally the mainstream media doesn’t register the complaints about bias of the SNP or wider Yes movement. But Mitchell’s presence as a “plant” was so blatant and the online outcry so precisethat no-one could ignore the claim. More problematic for Question Time- no-one wanted to.The stark truth is that the flagship programme of the British Broadcasting Corporation is now less popular amongst tabloid and broadsheet papers, north and south of the border, than a party that wants to leave Britain. That’s quite a feat and doesn’t represent any volte-face over independence by the mainstream media. Rather the press has marked Question Time out as the Weakest Link in the BBC’s current affairs offering.The rot set in quickly after the replacement of David Dimbleby by Fiona Bruce. In episode two, the “neutral” presenter wellied into guest Diane Abbott about Labour’s parlous state in the polls even though the party was level pegging with the Tories. Aunty was then forced to admit Fiona Bruce did refer to Abbott’s ‘personal and political relationships’ in the pre-show warm-up but insisted the presenter didn’t suggest the shadow home secretary got a frontbench role because of her previous closeness to Jeremy Corbyn.Astonishingly, Question Time seems to have got away with that highly unsatisfactory answer… until Motherwell.Scottish eyebrows were already raised at the unionist-heavy composition of the  Michael Forsyth of the Conservatives, Labour’s Anneliese Dodds, the SNP’s Fiona Hyslop, fashion model Eunice Olumide and journalist Hugo Rkind.One question for the SNP is why they let a Cabinet Secretary take part in such a nakedly skewed .My guess is that producers insisted Brexit not independence would be the main subject and thus the balance-demanding political faultline of the night. But independence was bound to come up and although Olumide is apparently a Yes voter– she tweeted later “Wish I had got the chance to say more about Scotland and independence” - Fiona Hyslop found herself isolated and outnumbered when Billy Mitchell was encouraged to hold forth. Olumide was excellent on the question of Liam Neeson and doubtless that’s why she was asked on. But independence needed another sharp-elbowed political operator ready to butt in without permission, because Question Time is a daunting arena in which only politicians and seasoned perfomers really thrive.Not my opinion but that of  year-old Jude Wilkinson who was an audience member some weeks earlier in Winchester“I did not speak up to disagree because speaking out is hard in an environment where unrepresentative audiences thunder applause for absurd arguments.The rush to insert adrenaline into rational debate is destructive to democracy. It is as though debate on matters of national policy is being done in a playground shout the loudest and you will win the argument. It felt utterly intimidating, stepping into the lion’s den.”And in Motherwell it was a highly unrepresentative lion’s den. Leaving the issue of independence to one side, North Lanarkshire like every other council area in Scotland backed Remain . Yet the programme was full of noisy Leave voters. This determination to impose a UK balance on each local audience is Question Time’s biggest problem.Its editors don’t recognise the importance of placewhich means they don’t recognise the reality of local opinion, which means they resort to the tawdry business of bussing in part of the audience almost every week to ensure “balance”. This is a practice the new weekly Scottish Question Time programme should not adopt. If it is broadcasting almost every week, then a genuinely Yes-leaning venue like Dundee can be balanced by visiting a genuinely No-leaning venue like Kelso the following week, achieving neutrality over time and – far more importantly – achieving credibility every week.If BBC Scotland’s new  programme encourages the full ersity of Scotland to be properly heard and explores domestic and international issues in addition to Brexit and independence it’ll be a dead-cert winner. But that now depends entirely on BBC Scotland dumping not tartanising the present, tired UK format. Thanks to Question Time’s recent string of failures on the neutrality front, authenticity is now far more important for the new BBC Scotland programme than aping Aunty to produce pointless screaming matches with imported bams or a dreary sameness. It would also be le-enhancing and politically importantBBC Scotland axed the UK ban on local places raising their own local issues. Worryingly though, it doesn’t look asthis new direction is likely to happen. According to respected health journalist Pennie Taylor, serial audience member Billy Mitchell was in the audience for a pilot episode of the new Question Time, filmed at Edinburgh’s Napier University last week.If true, that is unbelievable and BBC Scotland should admit its mistake. Otherwise the press and public will suspect the new channel is seeking notoriety, sensationalism and confrontation in a desperatye attempot to attract younger viewers. Not good for an important new programme on a publicly-funded new channel.Far better to go where UK Question Time fears to tread, and bring  discussions into the modern world, occupied by intelligent Scots in real places with real and erse political outlooks. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit economic impact british households are 1 500 worse off than before referendum","story":"Households in the UK have taken a #, hit since the Brexit referendum due to higher than expected inflation and stalling economic growth.The average income of homes across the country is £, lower than it had been predicted to be prior to the vote in , in which the UK opted to exit the European Union. window.twttr A new report said that the UK had experienced the sharpest slowdown in income growth of any comparable economy and higher than expected inflation levels – meaning Brits were spending much less than was forecaster.Contrast with the rest of the worldThe study, published by the Resolution Foundation said that households had £, less disposable income on average than they would have had under the Office for Budget Responsibilitypre-referendum forecast.It said that the economic “underperformance” that had been witnessed since  is a “largely UK-specic issue” and that the global performance had actually exceeded expectations.James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Two and a half years since the UK voted to leave the European Union, the country’s post-Brexit position remains far from clear.• : Leave-backing expats in Spain regret their decision as Brexit looms“There has been much discussion about the impact of this uncertainty on businesses, but not enough about its effect on household incomes.“The UK’s stark under-performance on income growth since  – which has tailed off more than other advanced economies – has left UK households taking a £, hit to their living standards.Economic growth has fallen“As we approach Brexit day on  March, politicians in all parties need to recognise how much is at stake for family living standards and that how the country goes forward, not just where it is heading, matters for household incomes in the here and now.”The report corresponded with another announcement from the the Institute for Fiscal Studies which concluded that a no-deal Brexit would leave the UK budget deficit £billion higher over  years thanBritain had stayed in the EU.It said the UK would require an additional two years of the post -style strict austerity measures to plug the gap.Official figures have also shown that, in the final quarter of , the UK’s economic growth slowed as car manufacturing declined.Gross domestic product growth fell to . per cent between October and December, according to the Office for National Statistics, compared with . per cent growth in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, annual GDP increased by . per cent, the weakest it has been since .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scots health board wins permission to recruit more australian nurses","story":"A Scots health board has won permission to recruit more nurses from Australia, to ease its staffing crisis.NHS Grampian already has  signed up from Down Under.

The aim is to encourage conversation and share experiences and knowledge about their own encounters with nature.Suzy Lee, ATLASArts film programmer, commented: “We are really excited about working with both Portree Primary and Budhmor House to offer this screening that encourages sharing and discussion.We’ve had a great response to the film and to our extended programme, so we look forward to showing the film in a new environment.”Centre with the primary seven girls from Portree Primary.Angus Beaton, a care worker at the centre praised the event for bridging the generational gap.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WINTER-19-TRACTOR-1.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

Nowadays even the most hard to wake sleepers have bleepers, bells and even the dulcet tones of Alexa at their bedside to ensure they get up for work in time.But in times gone by, it wasn’t just a case of a verbal shot across the bows from the bossyou turned up late for work - back in the so-called ‘good old days’ it could mean the loss of a day’s pay or maybe even your job. And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

Only one in ten of these people survived to be discharged from hospital. However, with CPR and defibrillationwithin  to  minutes of collapse, survival rates can rise to % and above.Ambulance response times to cardiac arrests are typically longer than this, as in Northern Ireland they average  minutes.

In  an offer was put in to purchase the former pub, and in September last year they finally moved in to the charity’s new home and began renovations to turn the building into a community facility.

Redmondshows Halax representatives Alan McLachlan and Gillian Boyd around the charitys new social enterprise shop, Wings n Things.“Mrs McFadden would have done a lot of work for charity within our town and in the local community so we really have brought that sense of community back in here,” Ms Redmond explained.Over the past six months charity staff and volunteers have been busy turning the run down pub building into a vibrant community hub which now houses a food parcel distribution project, a catering and education programme for vulnerable adults and those with learning dficulties and a senior citizens’ lunch club. Via Wings at Wellington House also provides space for after schools and parent and toddler groups, a monthly supper club and games nights, as well as volunteer and employment opportunities for many isolated and vulnerable members of the local community.Yesterday the charity held a special event to mark the opening of its new shop Wings ‘n’ Things, which will sell shabby chic and new craft items made by local crafters.Among the guests at the celebration were representatives from the Halax Foundation, which has provided funding for Via Wings to help it expand its Dare  Care project, which distributes food parcels to people in need.Thanking the Halax Foundation for providing £, towards the salary of a project manager, Ms Redmond said: “Their funding has enabled us to run the project much more efficiently because it has grown from a cupboard-sized project into a three-centred project.“We now provide food parcels to around  families every month, which averages out at about  people.To move or not to move  That is the Brexit question Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“As the number of people using our foodstore increases month-on-month the manager’s role is essential and the funding from the Halax Foundation ensures that we can continue to expand and develop the foodstore.”Gillian Boyd, trustee of the Halax Foundation NI, commented: “The Halax Foundation for Northern Ireland is delighted to support the important work of Via Wings. This particular award will enable the organisation to help those who are most vulnerable in their local community. We wish them every success in the future.”So far half of the old pub building has been renovated and Via Wings at Wellington House now boasts new offices, counselling rooms and a conference room. But that’s not the end of the redevelopment work.The charity is in the process of constructing a new coffee shop with a sensory garden and play area, which should be open within the next few months. And it also has long-term plans to redevelop another section of the building and create a wellbeing centre.“The wellbeing centre is going to be phase four,” Ms Redmond continued. “It would be our passion to have it up and running by the end of the year, but that will depend on fundraising and securing the necessary funding.“We hope the centre will help people – men and women – learn to live with their mental health. We want to provide things like reflexology, aromatherapy, breathing techniques, helping people learn about self care.”Praising the charity’s staff and volunteers for their dedication and hard work, she added: “Without them we couldn’t run this project. We have a team here that have a passion to serve this community, to walk in unity with them and see change happen.”• About the charity and its work...Founded in  by Gail Redmond, Via Wings was set up to help people in need in Dromore and surrounding areas.The faith-based charity’s aim “is to show God’s love in a loving, caring, practical, non-judgemental way.”It runs a range of projects designed to tackle problems such as poverty, loneliness, isolation, deprivation and more.

It would take a great team to beat his Naomh Éanna side in Championship football this season. On Saturday night, they went toe-to-toe with a fine Kilcummin outfit and came off second best as the Kerry men ran out emphatic -point victors.Central to Kilcummin’s success was the scintillating performance of Kevin McCarthy # who scored a remarkable -, all from play.As his team made their way off the pitch to a remarkable ovation from their large travelling support, the Naomh Éanna boss praised their efforts after a long season which still yielded two Championship titles.“We said coming down here we could live with playing our best and getting beat by a better team. I don’t think we played our best, but we were beaten by a better team,” said Fitzsimons.“Their goalkeeperpulled off two or three great saves and you need to be getting those scores at this level.“They are a super team. I said to the boys at half-time that we were still on the bus. This is a very young side # Eoin Nagle is only  and he was as good as anyone.“There is a bright future in front of those boysthey all stick together and continue to work the way they have been.”In truth, the North Belfast men never really recovered from a nightmare start which saw them concede - inside the first eight minutes with Matt Keane and McCarthy finding the target.A stunning goal from Eoin Nagle kick-started Naomh Éanna’s challenge following a couple of good points from Odhran Eastwood and a Ruairi Scott major on  minutes left just two points between the sides.However, their good work was swtly undone at the other end in a counter attack which halted their progress.Goalkeeper Paddy Flood fouled Noel Duggan as the corner-forward was bearing down on goal following a great pass inside from Seán O’Leary. Referee James Molloy awarded the penalty and issued a black card to Flood for the take-down.To add insult to injury, defender Conor McAuley picked up an ankle ligament injury in the goalmouth scramble which ended his evening.With substitute ’keeper Conor Devlin unavailable due to his soccer commitments with Larne, Michael Morgan donned the number one jersey for the remainder of the contest, but, following a y stoppage, he couldn’t prevent Kieran Murphy from scoring the penalty.With Kilcummin moving into a - to - lead at the break, the Antrim and Ulster champions needed a fast start to the second half, yet an unanswered salvo of - put the game firmly beyond Naomh Éanna. Former Kerry goalkeeper Brendan Kealy pulled off a smart save to deny Kristian Healy early in the half, but current Kingdom ist McCarthy stole the show with some majestic scores.He dovetailed well with the industrious Noel Duggan while Murphy and centre-back Chris O’Leary pushed forward with abandon. As Naomh Éanna continued to chase the game, their defence was exposed.When Healy tested Kealy’s reflexes once again midway through the half, Kilcummin went straight down to the Davin Stand side and with McCarthy splitting the posts in ruthless fashion.With less than  minutes remaining, Kilcummin bagged their fourth major with McCarthy applying the finish following a wonderful move involving Shane McSweeey and Gary O’Leary with McCarthy turning past the advancing Morgan in the Naomh Éanna goal before driving the ball into the net.In injury-time, he completed his hat-trick with his easiest finish of the night after being left unmarked in front of goal to round off a brilliant inidual display.It wasn’t to be for Naomh Éanna, but they’ll quickly turn their attentions to the new season and tonight’s Antrim Championship draws when they will learn who there opponents will be when they make their Senior Football Championship debut later this year.

People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37803787.ece/77d50/AUTOCROP/w620h342/NILGA.jpg","title":"call for northern ireland councils to be given more powers in absence of stormont","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

NILGA also called for a Brexit Support Found, which has been offered to local authorities in the rest of the UK to the tune of more than £m, to be provided to councils in Northern Ireland.Councillor Dermot Curran, NILGA president, said: “Councils in  are faced with huge expectations on their time and expenditure, in part due to the suspension of the Assembly, Brexit, transfer of responsibilities like event traffic management – costing around £, this year alone to ratepayers – without being offered budgets to deliver.\"Councillor Dermot Curran, President of NILGAHe added: “During the continued political impasse, councils are delivering more with less, taking on major infrastructure work as well as substantial, community led, preventative health work. \"Coupled with the burden of meeting arbitrary targets, councils, the smallest part of the public sector, are being asked to take on more responsibility as the only ing level of government in Northern Ireland, without the offer of additional resources required.”The Stormont Executive collapsed more than two years ago following the resignation of then Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, with councils in Northern Ireland operating as the only fullydemocratically elected government in the province.NILGA’s council team met with John Penrose MP, Minister of State in for Northern Ireland, in order to look at how councils’ additional pressures to deliver are funded, as well as forward planning how Northern Ireland’s £ billion public purse is given local, democratic scrutiny until the Assembly s.Derk McCallan, NILGA chief executive, said: \"Due to the current situation, members and chief executives across the  councils are becoming increasingly concerned about their ability to deliver on targets, with the threat of tick box bureaucracy in the background. Enough is enough.“This is why NILGA is calling for devolved political scrutiny of how we as councils are funded, what the deficits are, and enabling a piece of legislation to get us on a proper democratic and value for money footing. These aren’t political or ideological matters, so we can get them sorted. \"Local government elections take place in a matter of weeks and councils should not have to enter a new mandate over-burdened and under-resourced, trying diligently to deliver on many more expectations from a deserving public.Derek McCallan, Chief Executive of NILGA.“This is a reality check and a plea for normality. When our counterparts in England, Wales and Scotland are allocated over £ million in Brexit support, and we are offered an empty purse and a wish list, it’s time to wise up and give councils and communities the tools and the autonomy to get on with it.“Local government is a resilient, democratic anchor in Northern Ireland, but cannot be expected to bare burdens which are sent to us without cash and in a manner which is neither efficient nor necessary. Let’s use these elections to give choice, voice and control to communities, through councils.”"},{"url":null,"title":"catholics to be majority of workforce in northern ireland for first time in 2020 new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Coastguard described the images as \"concerning\".The pair, a male and a female, appeared to be wearing casual clothes of tracksuits and coats with no helmet or ropes. One eye-witness said they were \"hanging on like spiders\" and there didnt look to be anyone  with them.\"I didnt think it was real,\" he added.The man - who asked not to be named - said in all his le living on the coast he was left \"flabbergasted\". \"Professional climbers would not have been anywhere near Kinbane. Fair Head would be popular with climbers so I have seen the professionals and this was not it,\" he continued.\"Its madness. Had they fallen its the Atlantic Ocean. They wouldnt last long and theyd likely hit a rock on the way down. \"Theres been a lot of snow and rain over the past week and the grass is just sitting there so you put weight on it and its away from under you.\"Its a dangerous spot as its dficult for the leboat to get to so most likely they would have to wait on the Coastguard helicopter and that can be a  minute wait.

They clearly dont think anything of themselves or those that would put their lives at risk in trying to save them.\"Causeway Coast and Glens Councillor Joan Baird, who lives close to the location, said she was shocked and called on those to desist. \"Just consider those that would, without thought, risk their lives to come out to rescue youyou get into dficulty,\" she said.\"I am not against climbing so long as they wear the right safety gear and are trained. But this does not look to be the case. \"Over the summer there would nearly be daily call outs. I was out walking today and there were paths that I felt were not safe to walk on given the amount of slippage we have had after the snow last week.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\". He added: \"Given the ious and well publicised anti-DUP messages associated with the event in question, our party grouping decided unanimously to decline support for this latest Sinn Fein motion.\" "},{"url":null,"title":"westminster to prevent may from running down brexit clock says starmer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At this stage of the exercise, the Article  window is almost being closed now so we need a backstop.“The letter was an agreed letter that was sent out. The critical question is, is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not and that’s what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.“The critical thing is which direction is the Prime Minister heading in. Is she firstly trying to get her own team back on board to put her deal yet again with some supposed changes, and that’s what looks like she is doing, or is she genuinely looking to see a majority for Labour’s proposal of a customs union single market alignment.”He also expressed concerns over the backstop arrangement and in particular the customs arrangements for England, Scotland, Wales saying they “aren’t as good as they should be”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting Belfast He added: “I am concerned that with  days to go the Prime Minister is simply running down the clock, mindful that the next EU Summit is March  andshe’s is trying to run the clock down Parliament has to step in with a hard stop to say we are not going to accept that.”When asked his view on Labour Party colleagues calling for a second referendum, Sir Keir said: “I say we have got a conference motion on this, we agreed in advance what we would do and we tried to foreshadow the decisions we would have to make and we thought we would have to vote on a deal first,the deal goes down there would be a general election.“If there can’t be a general election then options including a public vote should be on the table. That’s what the Labour Party agreed and we agree unanimously and I think there is a good deal of support for that in the Labour Party.”Sir Keir met with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents workers across the island of Ireland, before he spoke with Ireland’s Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.Owen Reidy, the union’s assistant general secretary, said that workers on the island of Ireland cannot be “collateral damage” in Brexit.Mr Reidy said: “It’s really important that a consensus is built across the House of Commons but a credible consensus that also gets the assent and agreement of the EU. That’s the critical issue here.“Our view is Theresa May should look across the benches at the Labour Party and reach the softest possible Brexit and jettison the ERGand try and make accommodation with Keir Starmer and his colleagues who it seems to me are announcing a very soft Brexit with a UK-wide customs union and a close alignment with the single market. We welcome thatthere has to be a Brexit.“We’re very concerned because a hard Brexit is going to create as situation where WTO tarfs which are on average % so it’s going to lead to increases in costs for businesses and it’s going to lead to increases in cost for consumers and that’s going to hit workers,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"5 things you can name after your ex this","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

chief executive Liam Hannaway reflected upon the organisationrsquos work over the past year during the annual rates meeting.He said the organisation continued to deliver on both the services and key projects that were agreed in its current four-year corporate plan which ends in , working to improve the local authorityrsquos recycling rates, both for blue and brown bin collections, reducing the amount of waste going to landfill by %.Mr Hannaway said the council was also delighted to open the new poundm Down Leisure Centre which he described as a ldquosignature project that will make a real contribution to improving citizensrsquo health and wellbeing.ldquoWe are even more ambitious for the coming year, with the agreement on funding for the Belfast Region City Deal, we have plans for a new conference and theatre facility in Newry City, the delivery of the Southern Relief Road and a -year programme of economic growth, the chief executive continued.ldquoThe reopening of the Warrenpoint Municipal Park in August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an archaeological dig near Down Cathedral which will help provide more information on the legacy of St Patrick and a cross-community choir aimed at establishing and developing

of the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

It literally became a tidal wave of women going, lsquoYes Me Too, Yes Me Too, Yes Me Toorsquo.ldquoSexual assault is everywhere.It has been normalised. It has been accepted. Until we are shining a proper light on this, we need this to happen.ldquoIt has always been that way. Where did the phrase the casting coach come from  It is as old as the hills. It is accepted language. Because it is accepted language, do we have to accept that some women are going to have to be violated in order to get ahead in the industry ldquoI think its is abhorrent and I think that the way that women are portrayed on screen and how they are treated in the industry is rightly changing.However, McGrady, who is a former student of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, defended the storyline behind The Fall which shows Jamie Dornan playing Phil Spector, a serial killer of young women.ldquoI thought it was an excellent examination at to what would compel a man to violence against women, she said.The youngest of five children, McGrady also talks about feeling ldquodeeply emotional about the Mourne Mountains.She also touches on her need as a young girl to leave Castlewellan once she had left school ldquofor some adventure anywhere and how she has experienced mental health problems in the past with feelings of anxiety and depression.McGrady, who is now married and living in London, also speaks of the ups and downs of her acting career and how after she performed Macbeth with Sir Patrick Stewart in the West End and on Broadway in New York, she ed to London to work in a club.bull Eamonn Mallie mdash Face to Facehellipwith Niamh McGrady airs on UTV on Tuesday at .pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Centenary celebrations for Hollymount Pipe Band anniversary  ","story":"THERErsquoS a saying around these parts by those who know mdash lsquotherersquos two things you canrsquot get away from, farming and pipe bandsrsquo.Born just after the ending of the Great War in  and reformed after World War Two in , Hollymount Pipe Band is marking its centenary this year.It was the first pipe band formed in the Lecale district and sadly, it is the only one remaining out of eight.While the faces have changed over the years, therersquos one thing that hasnrsquot and thatrsquos the deep-rooted family connections between its members over the decades.Despite the advert of streamed TV box-sets, the internet and smart phone that increasingly take up much of our spare time, family ties between the generations remain strong here.In , there were six father-son combinations playing in the band which practices at Hollymount Orange Hall on the Woodgrange Road just outside Downpatrick.Today, within its -strong ranks, aged from three years to , are four father-child relationships with lead drummer Ronnie Steele going for the record with three of his four young daughters in the band.Sammy Strain is the bandrsquos elder statesman. He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science. Temporary classrooms make no provision for these subjects, which form over half of the curriculum, he explained.The headmaster told parents that since the school opened  years ago, with accommodation for  pupils, no extra provision had been made for practical subjects to facilitate the pupils now on the roll.ldquoNo matter which way the problem of accommodation is resolved the pupils are being discriminated against in regard to the subjects they can choose, he continued.ldquoFor  years chairs and tables have had to be carried in and out for the gymnasium and for  years the Department of Education has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of both the management and the South Eastern Education Board.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Marlene Fitzsimons is to represent Northern Ireland in the finals of the Miss British Legion contest in England in May.Marlene, representing the Downpatrick branch, won the Northern Ireland heats in the county town on Friday night and will now travel to the national finals to be held in Brighton.Miss Fitzsimons, from Roughal Park, beat entries from Dungannon, Omagh and Belfast, as well as last yearrsquos winner, Andrea Quinn, from Comber.The four points that the judges were looking for were Legion knowledge, Legion involvement, poise and appearance, and diction and clarity of expression.MOURNES mdash Newcastlersquos Shimna River has been ped as one of the water extraction rivers for the proposed new multi-million-pound reservoir at Kinnahalla in the Mourne Mountains.The news, announced late last night from Stormont, will be welcomed in Newcastle where there have been fears that the Shimna would dry upwater was taken for the new scheme.ldquoIt has been decided not to proceed with the abstraction intake on the Shimna River because of the possible affect a further abstraction might have on the river, said a spokesman for the Department of the Environment.ldquoIn addition the Department has agreed that a residual flow of water from the Fofanny reservoir should now be provided for the upper reaches of the Shimna and Fofanny rivers which will result in improvement downstream, especially in times of low flows and will also ensure that the amenity value of the Shimna to Tollymore Forest Park will be retained.Newcastle councillor Paddy OrsquoDonoghue said the announcement would be seen as a major victory for people opposed to the proposal.The new reservoir, which is being built on the upper reaches of the Bann downstream from the existing Spelga reservoir, will help meet the growing demand in the Belfast area, which is now approaching  million gallons a day and will also augment supplies to those parts of Co Down not at present supplied from existing Mourne sources.ARDGLASS mdash The badly decomposed body of a man was found on the rocks at Sheepland, Ardglass, on Monday morning.

The front door still has its peep hole and numerous locks, but the interior certainly does not resemble a station. The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17416861.the-spice-girls-bring-back-memories-for-laura/resources/images/9398635.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

At this stage of the exercise, the Article  window is almost being closed now so we need a backstop.ldquoThe letter was an agreed letter that was sent out. The critical question is, is she, in her response, indicating a willingness to drop her red lines or not and thatrsquos what needs to be tested sooner rather than later.ldquoThe critical thing is which direction is the Prime Minister heading in. Is she firstly trying to get her own team back on board to put her deal yet again with some supposed changes, and thatrsquos what looks like she is doing, or is she genuinely looking to see a majority for Labourrsquos proposal of a customs union single market alignment.He also expressed concerns over the backstop arrangement and in particular the customs arrangements for England, Scotland, Wales saying they ldquoarenrsquot as good as they should be.Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer has been visiting Belfast He added: ldquoI am concerned that with  days to go the Prime Minister is simply running down the clock, mindful that the next EU Summit is March  andshersquos is trying to run the clock down Parliament has to step in with a hard stop to say we are not going to accept that.When asked his view on Labour Party colleagues calling for a second referendum, Sir Keir said: ldquoI say we have got a conference motion on this, we agreed in advance what we would do and we tried to foreshadow the decisions we would have to make and we thought we would have to vote on a deal first,the deal goes down there would be a general election.ldquoIf there canrsquot be a general election then options including a public vote should be on the table. Thatrsquos what the Labour Party agreed and we agree unanimously and I think there is a good deal of support for that in the Labour Party.Sir Keir met with representatives from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, which represents workers across the island of Ireland, before he spoke with Irelandrsquos Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney.Owen Reidy, the unionrsquos assistant general secretary, said that workers on the island of Ireland cannot be ldquocollateral damage in Brexit.Mr Reidy said: ldquoItrsquos really important that a consensus is built across the House of Commons but a credible consensus that also gets the assent and agreement of the EU. Thatrsquos the critical issue here.ldquoOur view is Theresa May should look across the benches at the Labour Party and reach the softest possible Brexit and jettison the ERGand try and make accommodation with Keir Starmer and his colleagues who it seems to me are announcing a very soft Brexit with a UK-wide customs union and a close alignment with the single market. We welcome thatthere has to be a Brexit.ldquoWersquore very concerned because a hard Brexit is going to create as situation where WTO tarfs which are on average % so itrsquos going to lead to increases in costs for businesses and itrsquos going to lead to increases in cost for consumers and thatrsquos going to hit workers, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Westminster to prevent May from running down Brexit clock, says Starmer article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/house_11.jpg","title":"future of house of fraser in belfast secured amid fresh lease","story":"Posted on Friday February  by John Mulgrew The future of House of Fraser in Belfast appears to be safe after the retailer signed a fresh lease on its anchor store at Victoria Square, it can be revealed.
