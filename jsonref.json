And while the home is still used as the setting for the reality show, Kris Jenner no longer lives there.Instead, the 63-year-old has moved into a smaller property that she purchased for $9.9 million in December 2017. Kris has some familiar faces as her neighbors as the mansion is directly across the street from Kim and Kanye\u0027s home, meaning that she can visit her daughter, son-in-law and grandchildren whenever she wishes.Now that all of Kris\u0027s children have grown up and flown the coop, she has downsized with her latest home. In fact, the six-bedroom mansion is noticeably smaller than some of the other properties in the Hidden Hills neighborhood.It may come as a surprise to see that the momager is living considerably humbler than her kids. But as these aerial images show, Kris clearly still ensures that her house and garden are kept in immaculate condition at all times.         Aerial images show Kris Jenner\u0027s new Hidden Hills home which she bought in December 2017 for $9.9million         Kris\u0027 home includes a swimming pool and hot tub and her house and gardens are kept in pristine condition          The Kardashian matriarch downsized to this home after daughter Kim purchased the property across the street in August 2014The photos reveal a portable toilet outside that is presumably for the use of staff and workers. There is also a motorcycle parked on the property.Kris has plenty of space to unwind or entertain outside with an outdoor grill, large swimming pool and hot tub. She has also transformed the indoor space into the ultimate haven since moving in.\u0027I\u0027ve been collecting furniture and making houses for a lifetime.

The 21-year-old has multiple Ferraris, a Rolls-Royce, two Mercedes and a Range Rover.The latest photos of Kylie\u0027s mansion also show that she is conscious about keeping her home clean and tidy.

No one could tell me and it’s not my view.’ he said at the time.‘So if it’s not my view, I wouldn’t have made those comments,’ he added.

The enemy of the Palestinian people are Zionists, and Zionism is the enemy of peace and the enemy of the Palestinian people.’In a statement, Mr Burgon said he did not ‘recall’ making the remark when asked about the 2016 newspaper reports, and had asked for details of the quote.‘I received no reply, so I believed it was inaccurate to have claimed that I had used that phrase. It is now clear that I did and I regret doing so,’ he said.‘As I have subsequently said on numerous occasions when asked about this, I do not agree with that phrase,’ he added.‘The terminology has different meanings to different people and the simplistic language used does not reflect how I now think about this complex issue and I would not use it again today.’The footage was from 2014 - before Mr Burgon was elected as MP for Leeds East at the 2015 general election.Mr Burgon said he had been criticising the ‘aggressive expansionist policies’ of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.In the video, Mr Burgon also called for MPs who are members of Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) to resign from the group ‘in support of the Palestinian people’.At the time, LFI Director Jennifer Gerber said: ‘For nearly two years, Richard Burgon has deployed half-denials and weasel words to escape responsibility for his appalling suggestion that Zionism is the enemy of peace.‘Now that we’ve all seen exactly what he said, it’s time for Mr Burgon to apologise both for this slur on the Jewish people’s right to self-determination and for seemingly misleading the public about it.‘Somebody who aspires to be one of the country’s leading legal figures simply cannot behave in this fashion.’"},{"url":null,"title":"How did British diver stranded 300ft sea survive NO oxygen 38 minutes","story":"Share this article Youasa was ordered back to the bell. There was not enough play in his cord to look for Lemons, and the crew on the Bibby Topaz didn’t want to lose both ers. Inside the bell, Allcock tried to imagine how he was going to explain what had happened to Chris’s fiancee Morag.On the surface, the crew was battling to repair the ship’s navigation system. They knew every minute counted if they were to return to their original position and launch a search for Lemons. At best, they calculated, he might have eight minutes of air in his emergency tanks.As the clock ticked, and the technicians tried everything to regain control, the decision was taken to send down an unmanned probe with a camera to look for the missing er, starting in the immediate vicinity of the well.Alone on the seabed, Lemons knew his chances of survival were diminishing by the second. His best option, he judged, was to use what little air he had to find the well structure and climb up to where he knew there was a shelf.But disorientated by the intense darkness, he had no idea which way to head. If he went the wrong way, he would be lost for ever.For the first time that fateful day his luck was in. After a few stumbling steps with his arms held out in front of him in the black waters, he touched the metal structure. It was a minor miracle, but he had no time to waste reflecting. Soon he reached the shelf, but could see nothing in the hundreds of feet of water above that suggested a rescue was under way. And as he lay there, hope ebbed, and he felt the life steadily draining out of him. But he refused to panic and he made his peace with death.         How Chris Lemons survived alone with almost no air for 38 minutes in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet still puzzles experts. The best explanation they can offer is that the extreme cold caused his body to ‘shutdown’, allowing its vital organs to function in twilight mode on the tiny bit of oxygen left in his systemBy the time the underwater probe reached the well structure and spotted Lemons’s body, the crew above glued to the monitors showing camera footage could see he was still twitching.But by the time the navigation system was rebooted, 25 minutes after it crashed, the images being relayed to the Bibby Topaz showed Lemons was still.The crew concluded with regret that it was now a question of recovering a dead body.It took them several more minutes to get the Topaz back to its original position above the well. From the bell, attached to its underside, Youasa was instructed to e down to the platform and bring back Lemons’ body.It was a deadweight, as if confirming all their worst fears, but Youasa hauled it into the bell where Allcock tore off Lemons’ helmet and, more in hope than expectation, started to give him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.After just two breaths, Lemons shuddered into life. Yet, still, Allcock knew the chances of Lemons being left severely brain-damaged by lack of oxygen were overwhelming. But within minutes Lemons started talking coherently. He really had cheated death.How he survived alone with almost no air for 38 minutes in one of the most inhospitable places on the planet still puzzles experts.The best explanation they can offer is that the extreme cold caused his body to ‘shutdown’, allowing its vital organs to function in twilight mode on the tiny bit of oxygen left in his system.‘I don’t think I will ever know,’ Chris Lemons, now 40, says with a smile at the end of Last Breath. His life with Morag, which he thought had been so cruelly snatched from him, was fulfilled and they married as planned.And, remarkably, after all he went through that night when the North Sea did its best to claim him as its own, he continues to work there as a saturation er.

After she featured on the radio, a genealogist offered to help her to realise her seemingly impossible dream.They pieced together enough of the genealogical puzzle to locate the woman Mackin had been looking for. Perhaps even more remarkably, she was still alive. Her name is Elizabeth and she celebrates her 104th birthday this coming Saturday.Birthday presentShe received an early and unexpected birthday present on April 11th when her first-born daughter visited her at the home she shares with one of her two sons.“I just went over with my daughter and my husband and her husband and I knocked on the door and a gentleman opened it, and I told him I was from Ireland and that I had found my mum and could I come to see her, and he said ‘certainly’,” Mackin said.The woman she had sought for so long was sitting in the livingroom, and Mackin approached and explained she had come from Ireland to see her.“She said: ‘I was born in Ireland,’ and she was thrilled and she never let go of my hands and she put her arms around me.”Mackin said that when she asked if she knew that she was her daughter, Elizabeth “just looked up at me and took my hand and we had a great chat. There was such a bond between the two of us, it was fantastic.”The meeting was almost exactly how Mackin dreamed it would be.“I said to my children all my life that I loved this lady but I didn’t know who she was. And that is exactly what I got when I went to the door,” she said. “If you saw her little face, such a happy little lady, she is just fantastic. I can’t believe this surprise I got at this stage in my life, you can’t understand how thrilled I am.”GoodbyeMackin said it was hard to say goodbye to the woman she had spent so long looking for.“She wouldn’t let me go but I was afraid to stay too long with her because she is elderly and I have to respect that. But her son was so lovely and my mum said to me: ‘Oh I wish I could get up and make some tea for you but I don’t think I’ll be able.”Mackin and her family spent three days in Scotland before returning to Ireland.“I am going around singing, I’m that happy,” she said. “You have no idea what is has done to me. I’m just so happy and I’m so grateful.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3887068.1557436616!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"taoiseach dismisses esb option for broadband roll out","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOver the next seven years, 147,000km of fibre will be strung on existing Eir-owned poles, said Minister for Communications Richard Bruton in the Dáil. File photograph: GettyTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has insisted that giving a company such as the ESB responsibility to deliver high-speed broadband “won’t work as quickly and could cost even more” than the current state investment of €3 billion.Mr Varadkar said that the State’s interests in the deal with Granahan McCourt – which earlier this week was chosen as the preferred bidder for the largest single contract in the history of the State – was protected, stressing the investment is capped at €3billion.“Anything above that falls on the company,” he said.Denying that the timing of the announcement is an election gimmick, he said the Government could have made the announcement months ago but held off for final due diligence.“We wanted to make sure there wasn’t an alternative that would be quicker, that would be cheaper or would deliver 100 per cent coverage – and there isn’t. We’ve satisfied ourselves that there isn’t a Plan B.”Fianna Fáil’s decision in 1999 to privatise Telecom Éireann meant there was no choice today but to rent access to the poles and ducts now owned by its successor, Eir, said Mr Varadkar.“This new infrastructure is essentially piggy-backing along that infrastructure that was privatised 20 years ago. One of the ideas that we toyed with was renationalising Eir.“Just to do that alone would take years and we would have to compensate the shareholders with many billions of euros and that’s before we’d even start providing new fibre, so that wasn’t a realistic decision,” he said.However, criticism of the Government’s decision to proceed with the current plan for the roll out across the State continued unabated. Sinn Féin deputy leader, Pearse Doherty said officials in the Department of Communications were guilty of “cooking the books” when they produced a cost-benefit analysis.Department of Public Expenditure officials had dismissed the figures from the Department of Communications as “not credible”, documents released on Wednesday indicated.“They’re saying that they were cooking the books, that the bidder doesn’t have the capacity and that there’s no incentive for the bidder to deliver after a number of years if further losses are incurred,” Mr Doherty told t he Dáil.However, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said the Government had looked at all options available and had chosen high-speed fibre over mobile, or wireless because that is deemed the best choice today.Over the next seven years, 147,000km of fibre will be strung on existing Eir-owned poles, Minister for Communications Richard Bruton told Opposition TDs during sharp exchanges in Dáil.On Thursday, The  reported that the cost of the plan, including private investment, is now expected to exceed € 5 billion.Mr Bruton said the €5 billion figure would be the cost over a 25-year period.Fianna Fáil TD Timmy Dooley said Granahan McCourt will invest no more than €400 million. In reply, Mr Bruton said: “I do not want to confirm anything ahead of the finalising of contracts.” On Wednesday, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed provoked surprise when he told Clare FM that Granahan McCourt would invest no more than €200 million, with the rest coming in charges paid by broadband suppliers.Questioned in Romania, where he was attending an EU summit, Mr Varadkar said Granahan McCourt’s contribution is commercially sensitive and has to remain confidential at least until the contracts are signed.“Bear in mind the company will provide money in lots of different ways. There is the equity investment, there’ll also be working capital and there will be the money that the company raises from user charges,” he said.Former minister for communications Denis Naughten said he doubted that high-speed broadband will ever be delivered to rural Ireland if the proposed plan does not happen“If this falters I don’t honestly believe that we will ever get high-speed broadband into rural Ireland. I believe for generations to come we’ll be talking about haphazard services – it will be a Band Aid situation, for a few years it will be good and then it will drop off. It will become a big political issue again.”The timing is unfortunate, but not an election ploy, he believed. “This was ready to go last October, this is not about Netflix for people in rural Ireland, that perception is being put out there.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3884170.1557256045!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"britain and ireland to sign common travel area deal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney and David Lidington will sign the agreement in London on Wednesday ahead of a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill Campaigners calling for a boycott of the Eurovision song contest in Tel Aviv next week have rejected claims by the Israeli ambassador that they are extremist or pushing an anti-Israel agenda.Israel’s envoy to Ireland, Ophir Kariv, dismissed supporters of the boycott as an “extremist” minority who had a track record of hijacking cultural events to promote their agenda.The ambassador made his comments in an interview with The  published on Thursday.The campaign, launched last year after Israeli singer Netta won the contest in Portugal, is backed by Irish musicians, politicians and media personalities. Campaigners have appealed to Co Clare singer Sarah McTernan, who will represent Ireland in Tel Aviv next week, not to participate and a petition supporting the boycott was signed by thousands of supporters. “The Israeli government and their agents always try to discredit people who oppose them and raise legitimate democratic concerns about the treatment of the Palestinians which is an outrageous violation of human rights law,” said Independent Senator David Norris, who supports the boycott of the event.“I don’t regard myself as an extremist,” he added.Mr Norris denied that he was “anti-Israel” and said that he recalled a time, decades ago, when Israel was a left-leaning liberal democracy.“Now it is an extreme right-wing state which completely ignores and tramples upon the human rights of its minorities who are Palestinian,” he said.Strong supportSinn Féin Senator Fintan Warfield, who has joined calls for the boycott of the Eurovision, said he believed there was strong support among the public for Ireland to skip the event this year.“The people’s representatives in the Dáil have recognised the state of Palestinian almost five years ago and the Seanad has progressed a Bill to ban the import and sale of goods and services from illegal settlements. I think there is support for Palestine in Ireland and I think it includes this event,” he said. Mr Kariv described the Occupied Territories Bill, which aims to ban products from Israeli settlements considered illegal under international law, as “the most extreme, anti-Israel piece of legislation in the western world”. The Government is opposed to the legislation on the basis that it contravenes EU trade law. Independent Senator Frances Black said the Bill, which she proposed, was not anti-Israeli. She pointed out that it was supported by a group of eminent Israeli figures when it passed its first Dáil vote.“It is anti-occupation and breaches of international law. It ensures Ireland will not trade in goods produced as a result of clear, unambiguous violations of international law and human rights,” she said. She said the legislation was recognition that “a lasting, peaceful solution must be based on respect for international law”.“That’s what we are seeking to uphold,” she said.Mr Kariv warned that if the Bill, which is at committee stage in the Oireachtas, was enacted, it would have implications for relations between the Irish and Israeli people."},{"url":null,"title":"ireland considered to have one of the better eu records for rural broadband","story":"Ireland is already thought to have one of the better records in the EU for rural broadband penetration despite the controversy surrounding the cost and timeframe of the National Broadband Plan. An in-depth audit conducted by the European Court of Auditors last year showed the State in sixth place out of the 28 EU states in terms of fast rural broadband (30 megabits per second) with more than 80 per cent coverage. Of the five states ahead of Ireland, two were tiny countries (Malta and Luxembourg) while the Netherlands and Belgium were also more urbanised societies. In fifth was the UK, which had marginally more coverage than Ireland. However, when it came to superfast broadband (100 mbps) Ireland did not perform so well, finishing 12th out of 28 but still above the EU average. Subscriptions were at about 18 per cent. The report was published in June of last year, and examined the broadband plans of all 28 EU countries against three EU targets. The most significant of these were two fast (30mbps) and superfast (100mbps) targets. The former was to achieve 100 per cent coverage by 2020, while for the latter the target was 50 per cent coverage. The report found that across the EU there was less incentive for the private sector to invest in broadband provision. As a consequence, rural areas “remain less well connected than cities, and take-up of ultra-fast broadband is significantly behind target”. CoverageThe Court of Auditors also noted that the EU Commission estimated as far back as 2013 that up to €250 billion would be required to achieve the 2020 broadband targets.Ireland had significantly improved broadband coverage between 2011 and 2017, the report concluded, with more than 90 per cent overall coverage. This was in contrast to countries like Greece and France which have yet to achieve 50 per cent coverage. A further seven EU states remained below 80 per cent in 2017. However, of the five countries highlighted, the report found that Ireland and Italy were unlikely to have fast broadband available to all citizens by next year based on their current plans, while it was possible to achieve that goal in Hungary and Germany. In general, the report finds that across the EU the “fast broadband coverage hides a significant discrepancy between coverage in urban and rural areas”. “Across the EU coverage in rural areas was 47 per cent of the households in 2016, against the overall average of 80 per cent. “Only three, relatively small or urbanised member states, Malta, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, had coverage in their rural areas equivalent to the urban areas.” TechnologiesIt noted that in France its own authorities had questioned the relevance of the use of fibre to deliver broadband in certain areas, “since the costs of fibre are high and the implementation timing too long. France is now considering the use of other technologies such as 4G fixed wireless connections in certain areas,” it noted. The Court of Auditors finds the targets for ultra-fast broadband (50 per cent take-up by 2020) “remains very challenging for all member states”.“Although take-up has increased since 2013, in 2017 it remained under 20 per cent in 19 member states, a long way short of the 50 per cent target. Across the EU only 15 per cent of European households had subscribed to connections of at least 100mbps by mid-2017,” it says. Ireland is 12th, above the average and ahead of countries like France, Germany, the UK and Finland."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3887031.1557433450!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu leaders state intention to prioritise climate change action","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLuxembourg’s prime minister Xavier Bettel, Latvia’s Krisjanis Karins, France’s Emmanuel Macron and the Netherlands’ Mark Rutte at the EU summit in Sibiu, Romania. Photograph: Ludovic MarinEU leaders on Thursday put action on climate change at the top of the union’s agenda for the next five years. Meeting in Sibiu, Romania, leaders gave strong support to an initiative by nine of their number to emphasise the issue in political and financial terms in the union’s five-year “strategic agenda” to \u0026nbspbe approved by the June EU summit.The move was supported by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. “It’s an absolute priority that we leave our planet to the next generation in a condition that we inherited it, and climate change is a threat to life on this planet,” he said. “So we put it right up there with jobs and the economy, with migration and security challenges. We’re very much part of that group of people that wants us to intensify climate action.”He said that Ireland had not been able to sign the letter from the nine because “we’ve a difficulty signing up to more onerous targets for 2030. We don’t have a difficulty with the aim of carbon neutrality by 2050 . . . notwithstanding the recent figures that showed that our CO2 emissions are falling by about 7 per cent a year, we still think it’s going to be very difficult to meet the existing targets.“We couldn’t in good faith sign up to more onerous targets until we actually know that we can achieve them.”The meeting also launched a preliminary discussion on the filling of EU top jobs. In order to forestall attempts by MEPs to bounce them into automatically accepting the European Parliament’s nomination for the next EU Commission president, the leaders agreed to meet within two days of the parliamentary elections on May 28th to review their options.Nomination processEU Council president Donald Tusk told journalists that his overwhelming sense of the meeting was of a determination by leaders to take full responsibility for the future of the union. He intends, he says, to respect that spirit by pressing ahead urgently to start the nomination process for the EU’s top jobs – “swiftly, smoothly, and effectively”.The leaders are legally free to pick their own nominee, but parliament is threatening to vote down anyone not put before voters in the “spitzenkandidat” system – under which the candidate from the party with the largest vote is nominated as MEPs’ choice for commission president.The list of potential candidates for all the EU top jobs has been growing by the day and most of those mentioned for the commission, like chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, will not have democratic mandates.Mr Varadkar again strongly backed Manfred Weber, the spitzenkandidat of the Fine Gael group, the European People’s Party.Two international issues intruded on the agenda – the threat by Iran to pull out of parts of the 2015 nuclear deal, which has already been repudiated by the US and Turkish plans for offshore drilling operations in an area claimed by Cyprus as its exclusive economic zone, which have been condemned in recent days by the EU and US and are adding to tensions between Ankara and its western allies.Turkey and the Greek Cypriot government have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern Mediterranean, a region thought to be rich in natural gas. EU leaders expressed their strong defence of Cypriot sovereignty.“The EU stands united behind the Republic of Cyprus,” Mr Tusk said, “and expects Turkey to respect sovereign rights of EU member states.”At a pre-summit dinner in The Hague on Wednesday night, Mr Varadkar and Dutch PM Mark Rutte also had a wide-ranging discussion on all of the main challenges facing the EU. The Taoiseach then, on Thursday morning, hitched a lift on the Dutch government jet to Sibiu.Their meeting will help to consolidate an informal alliance known unofficially as the Hanseatic League, with which Ireland has become linked, an important part of its new diplomatic outreach post-Brexit. The “Hansa” brings together eight Nordic and northern European small states which share a broadly conservative fiscal outlook.Among the issues Mr Varadkar emphasised to journalists after their meeting were corporate tax and climate change. “Both countries strongly believe that tax is a sovereign issue,” the Taoiseach said, but they both recognise that “we can’t have a world in which large, very wealthy companies avoid paying tax anywhere”.He said that both men welcomed the progress being made by the OECD in preparing proposals on this issue.The UK’s Brexit minister, Stephen Barclay, speaking at\u0026nbspa fringe meeting in Sibiu, accused Europe’s politicians of “lazy thinking”, saying the EU should see Britain’s departure as an opportunity to build a new relationship rather than as “something to be punished”.British PM Theresa May had not been invited to the informal summit, which was focusing on the EU’s post-Brexit future, but Mr Barclay showed up to fly the flag. He spoke of his “frustration with the narrative in Europe on Brexit”. He said that the referendum had been a vote for “confidence, optimism, a desire to be more global”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3886935.1557428719!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"guaid%C3%B3 vows to defy crackdown after deputy detained","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVenezuelan opposition leader and self-declared president Juan Guaidó speaks during a press conference at Altamira neighborhood in Caracas. Photograph: Ronaldo SchemidtAFPGetty ImagesVenezuela’s opposition has vowed to defy a crackdown launched by the regime of president Nicolás Maduro in reprisal for last week’s failed uprising against the populist leader.Agents from the state intelligence service detained the vice-president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Édgar Zambrano, on Wednesday night for his role in the uprising. He was stopped in the capital Caracas in his car, which was then towed to a former shopping centre that is now used to house political prisoners.Mr Zambrano was just one of 10 opposition figures facing arrest after the supreme court, which is dominated by Mr Maduro’s chavista movement, stripped them of their parliamentary immunity following last week’s events. Richard Blanco, another of the group targeted, sought refuge in the Argentinian embassy on Thursday.Though details remain unclear, the planned uprising apparently failed after senior military commanders backtracked on promises to switch allegiances from Mr Maduro to the National Assembly head Juan Guaidó.He declared himself president in January in a bid to step up pressure on Mr Maduro and has since been recognised by more than 60 countries as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state.Mr Guaidó took to Twitter to say the “kidnapping” of Mr Zambrano would fail to halt his campaign to force Mr Maduro from power. Mr Zambrano’s arrest was also widely condemned by the international community. The International Contact Group on Venezuela, made up of the European Union and moderate regional states urged his “immediate and unconditional release”.But Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said on Twitter that foreign governments taking the side of those he described as “coup-mongers” made themselves accomplices in what he described as the “unconstitutional military uprising” of last week.Despite statements that it seeks to engage the opposition in dialogue, the Maduro regime has increased pressure on the National Assembly in recent weeks. According to the legislature’s political committee, 67 of the 112 opposition deputies have been subjected to political persecution, including detention and exile. The United Nations has classified the detention and subsequent disappearance of opposition deputy Gilber Caro as constituting “an enforced disappearance under international law”.Democratic legitimacyThe National Assembly is the last institution to enjoy democratic legitimacy in Venezuela. In a 2015 election that was widely recognised as free if not fair, the opposition alliance handed Mr Maduro’s United Socialist Party its worst ever defeat, winning two-thirds of the assembly’s seats.Chavismo responded to this loss by holding an election for a new constitutional assembly with powers superseding the National Assembly.The opposition boycotted what it said was a rigged vote designed to undermine the legislature and most regional organisations and the European Union refused to recognise the new body.Then last year Mr Maduro won re-election in a presidential poll that was again boycotted by the main opposition groups. Before the vote the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, said extrajudicial killings by Venezuelan security forces meant the country failed to meet the “minimal conditions for free and credible elections”.Mr Maduro has presided over the collapse of Venezuela’s economy, which has halved in size since he assumed office in 2013, causing widespread hunger and frequently leaving swathes of the country without electricity and running water.Diseases such as malaria that had been eradicated are once again rampant following the implosion of the country’s public health system and the United Nations estimates 3.7 million people have fled abroad as a result of the crisis."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3887001.1557432028!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second referendum could be healing process for brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn: “Quite honestly, the government has to move its red lines ...” Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPJeremy Corbyn has said a second referendum on Brexit could be “a healing process” that could bring “this whole process to a conclusion”. Speaking at the launch of Labour’s campaign for the European Parliament elections, Mr Corbyn said his party’s plan for a soft Brexit could unite the country.But he said that if Labour failed to get “a sensible deal” or trigger a general election, it would support another referendum.“The view we put forward . . . was that we should include the option of having a ballot on a public vote on the outcome of the talks and negotiations on what we’re putting forward. I would want that to be seen as a healing process, and bringing this whole process to a conclusion,” he said.‘People together’“Nothing is easy in this. But our essential message has to be to bring people together and that’s the basis on which we’ve approached both what we’ve done in parliament and in the negotiations itself.”Talks between the government and Labour about a common position on Brexit continued on Thursday and will resume next Monday. But Mr Corbyn said that the government could not expect to pass a meaningful vote (MV) on its Brexit deal without shifting its red lines.“The talks that we are having with the government have been difficult because the government is in some degree of disarray itself. They are still ongoing. Our point is that we want to protect jobs, protect trade and protect those rights that we have obtained. We met again yesterday and there will be a further meeting coming up,” he said.Red lines“But, quite honestly, the government has to move its red lines. We cannot go on having MV1, MV2, MV3 and then coming on for possibly an MV4, or a Bill that we have yet to actually see. So we will continue with that. If not, the issue has to come back to parliament at the earliest possible opportunity.”Theresa May on Thursday hosted DUP leader Arlene Foster, deputy leader Nigel Dodds and chief whip Jeffrey Donaldson for what Downing Street described as “a private, political lunch” at Chequers.“This was a useful opportunity to remind the prime minister that we want to see the Northern Ireland Assembly restored and the referendum result delivered in a way which strengthens the union,” a DUP spokesman said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But the two sides have until now agreed after every meeting that the negotiations are worth continuing and they will resume on Monday for what is likely to be their last week.The following week, days before the European Parliament elections on May 23rd, the government hopes to introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB). If the talks with Labour produce a common position, that will be reflected in the text of the Bill, which both parties would support.\u0026nbspFew at Westminster expect the talks to produce a common position on Brexit, however, so the government can only pass the Bill by persuading most Conservatives and a substantial number of Labour MPs to support it. Even if the talks with Labour fail to produce an agreed position, the two sides could agree a deal on a process that would at least allow the Bill to pass its second reading.Conservative MPs who are sceptical about the talks with Labour point out that although Theresa May’s deal was rejected three times and MPs voted down every alternative offered in indicative votes, one Brexit proposal has won a majority in the House of Commons. That is Graham Brady’s amendment endorsing the withdrawal agreement on condition that the Northern Ireland backstop is “replaced with alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border”.The European Union has made clear that the backstop is an essential part of the withdrawal agreement, which cannot be reopened. When they agreed last month to extend Britain’s membership until October 31st, EU leaders warned London that “any unilateral commitment, statement or other act should be compatible with the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement and must not hamper its implementation”.‘Realistic and sustainable’Many Conservatives believe nonetheless that the key to ratifying the withdrawal agreement lies in alternatives to the backstop and some are backing an initiative to find them. The Alternative Arrangements Commission, run by a pro-Brexit think tank but led by former Conservative ministers Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, this week appointed a panel of 20 experts to advise on alternative ways to keep the Border open.\u0026nbspDublin is sceptical about the group, not least because many of its experts have endorsed earlier proposals to replace the backstop that the EU dismissed as fanciful or unworkable. These include\u0026nbspcustoms experts Hans Maessen and Lars Karlsson, pro-Brexit trade lawyer Shanker Singham, and Graham Gudgin, a former economic adviser to David Trimble.The backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement, but as David Lidington pointed out after a meeting with Simon Coveney in London this week, the agreement allows for alternative arrangements to ensure it is never triggered.Coveney agreed, saying that if alternative arrangements “do the same job as the backstop, they can replace it” but that none had so far been proven to do so comprehensively. The problem for those at Westminster pinning their hopes on alternative arrangements is that, although the EU is open to exploring them after the withdrawal agreement is ratified, it insists that the backstop must remain in the agreement as an insurance policy.“What we can’t do is accept that there may be alternative arrangements without any guarantees at all and move ahead on that basis and then find that alternative arrangements don’t prove to be robust or solid. And then find in a few years’ time that we have huge political problems on the island of Ireland in the context of border infrastructure,” Coveney said.\u0026nbsp“We can’t sign up to that uncertainty because it will dominate politics in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland if we do that for the foreseeable future.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Ethan MillerGetty Towards the end of an almost-great career, which did not include his dream assignment as secretary of state, the US diplomat Richard Holbrooke confided in his diary. “The question constantly arises,” he wrote, after failing to win the ear of president Barack Obama, “how long do you want to do this?”The biography in which the quote appears, Our Man by George Packer, published this week, is meant as an elegy for the “American century”. It is too early for that. Relative decline is real but it is slow. Britain lost its economic primacy in the later 19th century but did not fall out of the first rank of powers until the middle of the 20th. The US should remain the most influential nation for a while yet.Instead, the book works better as an elegy for a certain type of Democrat. Holbrooke was outward-looking, diplomatic but open to the use of force, and restless to fix even the bits of the world that did not touch on American interests. The type has been familiar from Harry Truman’s time to Hillary Clinton’s. Much of the world is counting on its return if President Donald Trump loses the 2020 election. In place of narrowness and paranoia: global leadership. To judge by the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination, those expectations should be tempered.Diplo-waffleSeveral months into the race, almost none of the 20-plus hopefuls has said anything of note about foreign policy. The one candidate to define himself by the subject, congressman Seth Moulton, is trailing badly. The one most steeped in it, former vice-president Joe Biden, hardly brings it up. The party is as rich with ideas as it has been for a generation – universal healthcare, plans for climate change abatement – but they are either domestic or only tangentially international. There is plenty of diplo-waffle about respecting allies and recovering lost honour, but it all feels pro forma. It is not the pacifism or the isolationism or the realpolitik that is striking here. Those, at least, would count as policies, or at any rate impulses. What stands out is the indifference.US allies will find comfort in precedent. It is not as if the Democratic primaries of 1976 or 1992 were international relations symposia. Yet the first threw up Jimmy Carter, who struck the Egypt-Israel peace treaty, and the second produced Bill Clinton, who negotiated, via Holbrooke, the Dayton peace accord for the Balkans.Still, something deeper, more generational, seems to be at work this time. A new survey of public attitudes by the Center for American Progress, a think tank, finds that 59 per cent of baby-boomers – those born between 1946 and 1964 – and their elders believe the US should take a “leading role in the world”. Just 45 per cent of millennials and their juniors do. That will change as they age, you might think, but the number for the middle group of Generation X is just 46. In fact, lots of millennials and people born after them “hold no strong views whatsoever about any foreign policy or national security issue”.Triple fiascoIn other words, the Americans who are most keen on global burden-bearing will, to put it tactfully, stop voting over the coming decades. Governments must increasingly answer to an electorate that prioritises the domestic. Foreign policymakers might rather their craft take place in a Kissingerian bubble, sealed off from the mob, but such nuisances as the universal franchise will tend to get in the way. It matters, then, that millennial views of US leadership are so jaundiced by the triple fiasco of Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. This generation will soon be the largest segment of the US electorate. It is already setting the tone in the Democratic Party. The “liberal international order” (a phrase lost on voters, says the Center for American Progress research body) is not, despite the way it is sometimes discussed, a product of nature. It is the product of circumstances that have obtained for not all that long. One of these was a generation of willing Americans. That will has been slipping for a while. Now romanticised as a global citizen, Obama was at the time thought tentative and parochial, as was Clinton and, before the attacks of 911, George W Bush, too.At some point, it will register on the critics that inidual politicians matter less than the popular constraints on them. By skirting foreign policy, the Democratic candidates are being, well, democratic. If Trump loses to one of them, US allies can certainly count on a more gracious and predictable successor. But on not much more than that. In the end, the question Holbrooke asked himself is for voters at large, the ultimate underwriters of Pax Americana. “How long do you want to do this?” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2019"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3886840.1557431499!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"venezuelans and pacifists trade barbs at washington embassy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupporters of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó block a back entrance of  Venezuela embassy in Washington. Photograph:  Alex WongGetty It is more than two weeks since Matthew Burwick Orta began sitting on the steps of the Venezuelan embassy in Washington. The 51-year-old former photographer who moved to North Carolina from Venezuela two years ago was soon joined by dozens of his compatriots, many of whom are now staying in makeshift tents around the embassy.“This is my embassy. This is my country,” he says quietly as he points at the redbrick building, struggling to be heard amid the shouting taking place all around him.Located in the leafy neighbourhood of Georgetown, the Venezuelan embassy has become the site of political protest in recent weeks, transforming the usually tranquil streets into a focal point of civic unrest.Dozens of secret service and federal agents surround the barricaded building as harried locals try to navigate their way into nearby apartment buildings.Just beyond the barricades, two rival groups are shouting at each other and swapping insults, holding signs and forming human chains as the security services keep a watchful eye. Some sing the Venezuelan national anthem.The drama began late last month when a pacifist group called Code Pink occupied the building. Diplomatic staff representing the government of Nicolás Maduro had left the embassy in mid-April. Protesters belonging to Code Pink and Popular Resistance, an anti-war group, say they were invited in by the departing staff. There they have remained, hanging banners and demonstrating through megaphones from inside the building.Food and medicineThe group, which is protesting against the US government’s decision to recognise opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the leader of the South American country, attracted the attention of local Venezuelan residents, most of whom want Maduro gone. They have now set up their own counter-protest outside the building, in some cases blocking those inside from receiving food and medical supplies.Dressed in the group’s signature pink outfits, Medea Benjamin, the co-founder of Code Pink, tells me that her organisation’s main aim is to prevent another senseless US intervention abroad, arguing that Guaidó is not Venezuela’s leader.“We don’t want the embassy to be taken over by an unelected government,” she says, referring to Guaidó’s representatives in the US amid reports that they may soon move into the building.“We have a right to protest. These people are preventing food and medicines from getting into our people inside,” she adds as another shouting match erupts between her aides and a row of Venezuelan protesters.But the Venezuelans who have gathered here disagree.“They believe in non-intervention, but what do you call this?” says 26-year-old Daniella Bustillos. “A group of Americans trespassing, staying illegally in our embassy? This is US intervention. They’re assuming that we don’t know best for our country and our people.”Matthew Burwick Orta agrees. “I was forced to leave my country. I am a journalist, photographer and you become a target. The police don’t work for the people. Maduro is a dictator.”‘Reality of life’He says he has suggested to the Code Pink protesters that they should go to Venezuela and see the reality of life there. “It is a tragedy what is happening in Venezuela. I have experienced the reality of living in the country. Friends of mine, innocent people, are in jail. You couldn’t protest like this, for example, in my country,” he says.As the standoff between the two groups continues, a tussle erupts as a Code Pink protester tries to get food into the embassy through the front door, prompting the security services to intervene and prevent her from accessing the building.But most of the time the secret service stands quietly by. One of the guards says it is the job of the secret service to protect embassies, but says he can’t say any more.While the situation at the embassy has become a symbol for what is unfolding in Venezuela, it has also opened up tricky legal questions. As illustrated by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s long stay in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, technically police cannot enter an embassy owned by a foreign government. But the unique political situation currently in Venezuela complicates things further, given that the US recognises the authority of Guaidó.Publicly the state department has called on the protesters to leave the building, and the administration believes the Venezuelan government – led by Guaidó – ultimately has legal authority over the embassy in DC.Many believe that a trigger point may come if the administration allows Guaidó’s representatives in the United States to enter the building. It is also unclear how long the two dozen or so protesters mainly residing in a conference room on the second floor can hold out as it becomes increasingly difficult to get food into the building.In the meantime, both sides seem unlikely to cede ground. One young Venezuelan protester holding a sign reading “stop whitesplaining my country” says she is using all her annual leave to spend every day and night outside the embassy. “They don’t know anything about the situation in our country. We do. This is our embassy and we’re staying here.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/02/10/TELEMMGLPICT000051671687_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqO65TkrT7BriBrd3fK6VEg2oOnP5Tf-6BsL77M1adEXU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"sir philip green staff told wear revealing clothes visited","story":"Sir Philip Green in 2014 with models, left to right, Suki Waterhouse, Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne, Sienna Miller and Naomi Campbell.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignFake German heiress Anna Sorokin jailed in US for up to 12 yearsLondon mosque shooting: Police hunt gunman armed with \u0026#39blank-firing handgun\u0026#39North Korea launches two ballistic missiles amid stalled talks with USNHS accused of \u0026#39losing its grip\u0026#39on cancer screening as checks fall Pharmacists sent into care homes amid fears pensioners are being put at risk by drugs cocktail Prince William launches national 247 mental health text service amid call for 3,000 volunteersFreddie Starr dies aged 76: Tributes paid as comedian found dead in SpainMichael Gove considers relaxing shooting ban to allow people to kill pigeons as quarry in first climb down since ban Grand Designs: The Street -

accounting for 33 per cent of all cases, while back pain and other muscular problems made up 17 per cent of records logged.A fit note is issued after the first seven days of sickness absence, following a doctor’s assessment of the patient’s fitness to work.GPs can decide if a patient is unfit for work, or could be fit for work if their workplace or job was adapted to take account of an illness or condition.In total, 2.386 million notes were issued in the last quarter of last year - a 2 per cent rise on the same period the previous year.Fit notes were introduced in 2010, amid promises they would reduce reliance on incapacity benefit, and help those with health problems return to work.Other areas with high numbers of fit notes issued, relative to their populations, include Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Humber, and the North East.  Those with low numbers include Hampshire, Thames Valley, Isle of Wight, Kent and Surrey and Sussex.Fake German heiress Anna Sorokin jailed in US for up to 12 yearsLondon mosque shooting: Police hunt gunman armed with \u0026#39blank-firing handgun\u0026#39North Korea launches two ballistic missiles amid stalled talks with USNHS accused of \u0026#39losing its grip\u0026#39on cancer screening as checks fall Pharmacists sent into care homes amid fears pensioners are being put at risk by drugs cocktail Prince William launches national 247 mental health text service amid call for 3,000 volunteersFreddie Starr dies aged 76: Tributes paid as comedian found dead in SpainMichael Gove considers relaxing shooting ban to allow people to kill pigeons as quarry in first climb down since ban Grand Designs: The Street -

The number might\u0026nbspget to 15 million by the mid-2020s, up from 10 million, “if the conditions are right, especially the regulatory and policy enablers”.\u0026nbspBT telegraph pole removed for blocking plaque for leading suffragetteKlopp won’t focus on Liverpool vs Barcelona or ‘b******t like that’BT advert banned for unsubstantiated broadband speed claimsJansen saying that is a bit like Jurgen Klopp telling Liverpool fans he can win the Champions League if conditions are right, “especially the referee and linesmen enablers”.\u0026nbspThe backdrop to this is that OfCom is currently fixing up its regulatory framework for 2021-2026. BT would also like the government to grant it some relief on the business rates it has to pay on the fibre it lays. If it sounds odd that the taxman charges the company for these, remember those cables represent real moneymaking businesses even if their premises are holes in the ground.\u0026nbspIf Jansen gets what he wants,\u0026nbspmaybe the “ambition” to connect 15 million homes and businesses by the mid-2020s will turn into a firm target with a less woolly date attached to it.\u0026nbspLet’s be clear here. The company has a right to make a return on its investment, but its past history in this area isn’t all it might be. It’s open to the charge that it has used the infrastructure monopoly it has long\u0026nbspenjoyed in large parts of the country to fund a fat idend for\u0026nbspinvestors at the expense\u0026nbspof the national interest.\u0026nbspThis has put an unnecessary brake on the economy and left the UK lagging behind its competitors. It is one of the reasons regulators forced the semi-separation of OpenReach, BT’s\u0026nbspinfrastructure arm that is a big contributor to BT’s payout, from the rest of the group. Many critics argued that didn’t go far enough. They wanted\u0026nbspthe company\u0026nbspbroken up.\u0026nbspRight now BT and its referees are playing nice because nothing’s been finally decided. There’s a lot of positive talk about constructive discussions, etc.OfCom is likely to set out different rules for BT in different areas of the country, depending on whether there’s competition or not.\u0026nbspThis makes sense. New companies have moved in to join it\u0026nbspand Virgin, and some of them are even having a go at connecting rural areas, where the lack of reliable broadband seriously hampers the\u0026nbspeconomic outlook. They’re having a beneficial impact. The rate of fibre connection has doubled nationwide.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

He sets the rules for how to distinguish violent and incendiary speech from the merely offensive, and he can choose to shut down a competitor by acquiring, blocking or copying it.”Mr Hughes admits that he and other members of the early Facebook team should have done more to ensure that the site couldn’t be abused to “change our culture, influence elections and empower nationalist leaders”.But he says that the only way to bring that power into check now might be for the government to intervene and break up Facebook. Recent attempts to constrain the power of the company do not go far enough, he wrote, and the only way to keep the domination of Facebook in check is to force it to stop having such a vast power over the internet.“We are a nation with a tradition of reining in monopolies, no matter how well intentioned the leaders of these companies may be,” the article reads. “Mark’s power is unprecedented and un-American.”Specifically, Mr Hughes argues that the company should be separated into different companies. The US government could also revoke the 2012 acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp so that they will return to functioning independently, he writes.“The cost of breaking up Facebook would be next to zero for the government, and lots of people stand to gain economically,” he said. “A ban on short-term acquisitions would ensure that competitors, and the investors who take a bet on them, would have the space to flourish. Digital advertisers would suddenly have multiple companies vying for their dollars.”In calling for such an intervention, Mr Hughes adds to a growing a number of voices in US politics who have argued that the only way to limit Facebook’s power is to break it up. Politicians including senator and presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren have called for more regulation on the social network, and has been joined by voices across the ideological spectrum, including Ted Cruz.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.422 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 722 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1022 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2122 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together.

The Independent’s Geoffrey McNab wrote: “The wonder here is the very dexterous way the film deals with such intricate subject matter. This is an extraordinary feat of planning and logistics.\u0026nbsp“The Russo brothers, working from another screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, are dealing with death, bereavement and separation but show remarkable lightness of touch and humour in the way they do so.One of the most impressive elements is the ease with which the film switches back and forth in time, seamlessly changing storytelling styles.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is, the company says, the biggest problem with wearing shoes, and bad fit leads to uncomfortable sneakers, worse performance, and people returning shoes or just simply not deciding to buy new ones. And now Nike says, that widespread problem – attested to by unworn shoes found around people\u0027s houses, and blisters and blood on people\u0027s feet – is fixed.It says it has done so with the invention of a new app that will encourage people not to pick shoes by selecting a number, but instead scanning their feet. By using a phone\u0027s camera, the new app will gather a full picture of the size of your foot – and then use that to decide which shoe to send you.Eventually, Nike thinks we might be able to do away with sizes entirely,\u0026nbspwith shoes instead turning up at your door without a number or gender written on them, and instead with just your name. But for now, the company wants to change how you get to that size.While shoes have changed in a variety of unrecognisable ways, the fundamental way that they\u0027re fitted to your feet hasn\u0027t altered much since the 14th century. Back then, cobblers would grab hold of a piece of equipment called a last, built to represent a foot, and sew up the material to make the shoe around it so that it would fit to people\u0027s feet.Those shoes eventually formed into a standard size, which remains in place as the numbers used across the world today. That all happened\u0026nbspso long ago that they are based on the dimensions of a kernel of barleycorn.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has cancelled its AirPower wireless charging mat, which was slated as a way to charge numerous apple products at once India has claimed status as part of a super league of nations after shooting down a live satellite in a test of new missile technology5G wireless internet is expected to launch in 2019, with the potential to reach speeds of 50mbsUber has halted testing of driverless vehicles after a woman was killed by one of their cars in Tempe, Arizona.

The sewing might be done by machines and the lasts might be made out of the latest materials, but the way they are fitted around the feet and the numbers used to describe that fit is unchanged.Nike says it has improved the shoe so good it became controversialIt is a process prone to error: most people are in the wrong sized shoes. More than a quarter of shoes come back to stores because they don\u0027t fit, and Nike thinks that the number is actually probably even higher when it accounts for the people who simply go on wearing badly fitted sneakers, or don\u0027t ever wear them at all.That leads to a whole variety of problems. Rubbing, blisters and blood will all be familiar\u0026nbspto just about anyone who has ever worn shoes for athletes, it can mean not just pain but poor performance, since shoes are built to fit precisely onto the foot.Nike founder Bill Bowerman, for instance, was famous for ripping apart standard shoes and resewing them to fit around the feet of the athletes he was training. Shoe companies have been trying to do the same on a broader level ever since, though the problem has stayed largely the same.The technology currently\u0026nbspused to try and fix that problem is decades old in itself. In Nike stores around the world – and just about every other shoe shop – the piece of machinery known as a Brannock Device tries to assess people\u0027s feet by pushing sliders around to measure them at their widest and their longest, but that in itself can lead to badly fitting shoes.Nike thinks that has been fixed by the new technology known as Fit. It uses a phone\u0027s camera to scan the feet, combines that with augmented reality technology to understand just how big they are, and then feeds that into its vast array of data about the shoes that it makes.It thinks that technology is not simply going to make shoes fit better, by taking into account the precise dimensions of the foot and the lacing, fit, stitching and materials of the shoe. It thinks it could fundamentally alter the way people buy shoes, and make the traditional barleycorn-based measurements out of date.Size is a lie, Nike says. And it claims its new app is ready to tell you the truth.The new feature will appear initially inside of the Nike app, as well as in a slightly different experience in stores. But both rely on the same basic principles, if they are presented in different ways.When it launches, anyone heading into the app to buy shoes will be presented with the normal list of sizes when they do. But they\u0027ll also be told about Nike Fit, alongside a button offering them the option to try it.Pressing that will open up the camera and a whole host of instructions. They\u0027ll be told to allow the phone to scan their floor so it can get a sense of proportion. After that they\u0027ll stand next to the wall and simply point the shoe at their foot.At that point, the phone starts doing its work. It uses computer vision to scan the foot – using only the camera of the camera and the capabilities of the app – and then combines that with data science to scan the foot and read what it says are dozens of different datapoints about the size of your feet.Once it has those measurements, offering a precise picture of your foot morphology, it is fed into a machine learning model that is learning how feet are sized over time. By combining that information about your feet with all of Nike\u0027s information about its shoes, it can compare the two and decide what shoe size you actually need.That measurement might vary with the shoes it might even be different for alternative versions of the shoe, because of the way the materials work. (This writer\u0027s feet were generally a size above what had been expected, and had a range of a range of three different sizes for different shoes.) The measurement might even vary between your feet, with one slightly larger than the other, and in the future it could be possible to have differently sized inidual shoes to match.Getting this wrong could be very bad indeed. A huge number of people already suffer with wrongly sized shoes – and if the app got them even more wrong, then it could simply exacerbate the problem it was created to fix.Nike says it is confident it will work because it has been testing it in stealth mode for months. Some select Nike Stores have quietly swapped out the traditional Brannock Devices for the app, allowing the company to gather feedback and look at how the measurements match up.We\u0027ve had true measurable results that\u0027s inspiring confidence,\u0026nbspsays Adam\u0026nbspSussman, Nike\u0027s vice president and general manager for Nike Direct Digital and Geographies. That\u0027s why we also feel really comfortable going out with this so broadly so quickly because the results are pretty astonishing especially when you compare it to the results that you get with with a Brannock device.It will keep collecting that data as the app goes into use, rapidly collecting unprecedented amounts of data about the size of people\u0027s feet. (Nike says it takes the responsibility of storing that data extremely seriously, and that people will be able to remove it from their account if they desire.) It says that data will be fed back throughout the company, a process that could lead to new shoe designs or sizes.At the moment, the primary reason not to innovate\u0026nbspfurther and faster is a concern for consumers. People have lived with the traditional shoe sizing system for centuries – and it wil be a tough thing to change with a click of a camera and an app update.There is a consumer journey, and\u0026nbspyou have to bring the consumers along with you, says Sussman.\u0026nbspBut you can see it as completely redefining how you purchase the right product for you.Nike is aware that this could all be a little stressful. One way of trying to alleviate that is that\u0026nbspthe app actually slows down the process of scanning your feet and shows a readout that is strictly unnecessary, just so that people can see it is doing something. That was part of a commitment to ensuring that the app was simple and non-intimidating no matter how complicated the underlying technology was, says Nike\u0027s Josh Moore, who led the design of the app.It\u0027s not the first time that Nike has introduced such new features into its app, or those based on augmented reality, which\u0026nbspis used heavily in its SNEAKRS app. The company used lessons\u0026nbsplearned from the introduction of those feautres to inform the new release, Moore said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn the future, with even more work and more feedback, that could develop into new ways of understanding shoe size – or giving it up completely.I think there\u0027s some things that we have clear line of path or visibility to, says\u0026nbspSussman. And then there\u0027s some things that we don\u0027t even know where this could take us.That future could include shoes that are in some way post-size: not based on gender or barleycorns, but just chosen by a computer to fit as snugly as required around your feet. Nike has already experimented with abandoning size – it offered its Presto shoes in small, medium and large, which was neat but didn\u0027twork for more performance-focused shoes – and this new feature could be the leap forward required to take the numbers of boxes and replace them instead with your name.I believe that there\u0027s a way a view into the into the future that\u0027s not so distant from a technological standpoint that we can get there, says Sussman.\u0026nbspWe\u0027re just going to say: this is the right shoe for you.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But we have discovered some spectacular exceptions, said deep-sea visual ecology specialist Dr Fanny de Busserolles from the University of Queensland, one of an\u0026nbspinternational team of scientists that took part in the study, published in the journal\u0026nbspScience.\u0026nbspLed by\u0026nbspProfessor\u0026nbspWalter\u0026nbspSalzburger\u0026nbspfrom the University of Basel they recently analysed more than 100 fish genomes.\u0026nbspThey found that fish deep-sea fish had expanded a certain gene called rhodopsin which gave them this remarkable vision.Photopigments in the cone cells found in the retina give vertebrates colour vision. Each photopigment reacts to a certain wavelength of light.In humans, for example, these wavelengths are red, green and blue.Deep sea snailfish has \u0027soft bones and open skull to survive pressure\u0027Bizarre deep-sea creatures wash up on Scottish beachHowever\u0026nbspcolour vision is only possible during daylight.When it’s dark\u0026nbspvertebrates detect light particles with rod cells, which only contain a single type of the photopigment rhodopsin. This is why nearly all vertebrates are colour-blind at night.Zoologists found certain deep-sea fish had an increased number of rhodopsin genes. They found this by doing functional experiments on rhodopsin proteins in the lab.\u0026nbspThe silver\u0026nbspspinyfin\u0026nbspfish had the best vision by far with more than 38 copies of the rhodopsin gene which means they probably see many colours.It appears that deep-sea fish have developed this multiple rhodopsin-based vision several times independently of each other, said Prof\u0026nbspSalzburger.These genes mean they can\u0026nbspsee the wavelength range of light produced by bioluminescence. This ability could have evolved as a survival weapon.Dr Fabio Cortesi from the University of Queensland added: There are many colours of bioluminescence - light produced and emitted by living organisms - down there, and it mainly appears in flashes coming from other fish.\u0026nbspIf you want to survive down there you need to quickly decide if you are seeing a potential predator or potential prey.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We can’t succeed without them and thousands of people come into work at Uber every day focused on how to make their experience better, on and off the road.Whether it’s being able to track your earnings or stronger insurance protections, we’ll continue working to improve the experience for and with drivers.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That’s insane. ‘I don’t know, I haven’t spoken to her?’ That’s ridiculous. Pathetic, pathetic,” he says.The comments are in contrast to the EU’s diplomatic public approach to talks, throughout which they heaped praise on their counterparts such as Ms May and David Davis.On another occasion captured in the documentary, Edel Rettman-Crosse, Mr Verhofstadt’s top aide, describes the UK’s then Brexit secretary Mr Davis, who the team has just met with, as having his “head in the f***ing clouds”.The officials agreed that Mr Davis\u0026nbspdid not “really give a f**k” about the Irish border, one of the key issues\u0026nbspthat bogged down Brexit talks for months afterwards.“David Davis explained to us that Ireland is not a problem,” says an exasperated Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin, recounting the meeting. The Brexit deal has since been blocked by the UK parliament effectively over the Irish border question.Ms May’s conference speech also goes down poorly with the team, with Mr\u0026nbspMcLaughlin shouting “Oh, f**k\u0026nbspoff!” at the screen when the prime minister\u0026nbspclaims she is working hard to get a deal.The film also gives the impression of a Brussels that feels totally unthreatened by the UK, with regular mocking doled out at the UK’s expense.Over breakfast in one scene, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Barnier end up discussing classic cars, and Mr Barnier jokes: “That’s what they’re trying to do with Brexit, take an old car and restore it.Created with Sketch.Opposing protesters flock to parliament on would be date of Brexit Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentPro-Brexit leave the European Union supporters attend a rally in Parliament Square after the final leg of the March to Leave in LondonThe protest march which started on March 16 in Sunderland, north east England, finished on what was the original date for Brexit to happen before the recent extensionA Brexit supporter sips a can of Stella in protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentDedicated anti-Brexit campaigner Steve Bray and likewise pro-Brexit campaigner Joseph Afrane go head to head near the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit marching band in Parliament SquareRemain supporters wave EU flags from a bus in Parliament SquareA Brexit supporter protests outside of the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters protest outside of the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit flag is waved in Parliament SquareThe March to Leave nears the Houses of ParliamentBrexit supporters carry the coffin of democracyBrexit supporters take part in the March to Leave protest in LondonA Brexit supporter holds a sign outside the Houses of ParliamentA man holds satirical paintings of politiciansAn pro-Brexit float on the March to Leave march in LondonFar-right activist Tommy Robinson addresses protesters outside the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentA Tommy Robinson supporter arrives at the Houses of Parliament A jogger gestures rudely at a Brexit supporter outside of the Houses of ParliamentA Brexit supporter outside the Houses of ParliamentElmar Brok, a German ally of Angela Merkel who sits on the Brexit steering group, says the EU should not help the UK sort out its “mess”.\u0026nbsp“I am very clear we have to do nothing. We are ready and they have to come,” he advises. “And we have to wait while the air becomes thinner and thinner because we lose time.”On another occasion, officials are also bemused at Ms May’s invocation of “war spirit” in her conference speech.After one encounter in which Mr Verhofstadt has an argument with Brexiteer Tory MP Andrew Rosindell,\u0026nbsptop aide Ms\u0026nbspRettman-Crosse tells her boss: “I’m most proud of you when you take on a Tory. He was a f***er.”The documentary is likely to be seized on by second referendum campaigners and opposition politicians as evidence of the UK’s incompetence in talks. It is also likely to anger Brexiteers, many of whom see Brussels as trying to punish the UK.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those injustices aren’t to do with backstops, implementation periods and all that obscure jargon.”Turning his fire on Nigel Farage and the newly formed Brexit party, Mr Corbyn said the election on 23 May represented an opportunity to “challenge the poison being peddled” by the former Ukip leader.He continued: “Nigel Farage’s Brexit is a Brexit for conspiracy theorists. For those who see Muslims and migrants or George Soros as the enemy. Only Labour can see off the Farage snake oil in this election.”Responding to Mr Corbyn’s speech, Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson, said: “It’s the same old broken record from Jeremy Corbyn. He is throwing all regard for the environment, for jobs and the NHS out of the window with his personal obsession with taking the UK out of the EU.“It is clear that Jeremy Corbyn has trashed the hopes of Remainers. Like the Tories, Ukip, or the Brexit Party, a vote for Labour at the European elections is a vote for Brexit.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes.

Antonio Burgos, 48, was dealing with a failing marriage and orce proceedings when he first approached an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent near the Oregon-Washington border in May of 2018. Burgos offered the agent $3,000 to deport his wife and her child from a previous relationship to their home country of El Salvador. Rather than accept the bribe, the ICE agent reported Burgos’s request to the Office of Professional Responsibility.

summer.”“It is crucial to redirect the financial flows, both private and public, towards the climate action,” the paper added.\u0026nbsp“The EU budget currently under negotiation will be an important tool in this respect: at least 25 per cent of the spendings should go to projects aimed at fighting against climate change.”Created with Sketch.Greta Thunberg inspires climate activists everywhere: in

Nobody trusts Mrs May and for good reason. She has broken too many promises.She insisted we would leave the EU customs union which sets our trade policy and our tarfs with other countries.Now she is ready to tear up this pledge, leaving Britain in limbo with no say and no gain. We will also abandon hard-won trade-union reforms and accept the sort of red tape that has seen EU joblessness rates soar.The PM is being pressed to allow a second referendum — rejected, until now, as a total betrayal of the first one.Will she go wobbly on this promise, too The stark truth is that Mrs May should not even be in charge of talks.She is now working her notice with no authority as PM. She should have been kicked out after her catastrophic general election shambles.Jezza has also upset voters by putting his Downing Street ambitions and a hunger for a general election ahead of the national interest.Voters knew exactly what they were doing last week when they gave a V-sign to both parties. They will give them an even bigger kickingthe EU poll goes ahead later this month.Parliament has failed. MPs have defied the will of the people by refusing to enact the democratic choice made in  to leave the European Union.Voters will use Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party as a stick to beat them with.Farage is a much more challenging figure this time round.The slightly raffish former merchant banker has grown out of his “cheeky chappie” Ukip image. He is now electable. Fed-up punters, both Tory and Labour, will vote for him in their millions.Unless the Tories wake up very quickly, dump Mrs May and pick a genuine pro-Brexit leader, he will be fielding a party of his own MPs in Parliament after the next election.The Brexit Party will have its first MP in just a month’s timeJacob Rees-Mogg’s sister Annunziata wins the Peterborough by-election on June . Smug Remainers should now see how much they are out of step with the great British majority.The likes of Anna “Suck It Up” Soubry and co-conspirator Dominic Grieve will pay the price as their Change UK party sinks without trace, swamped by a pro-Brexit surge.Pro-EU Lib Dems are a phantom party, led by ghostly Vince Cable, a bolt-hole for voters who can stomach neither Labour nor Tory.Cynics claim this is the end of the two-party system.Labour, under its present leadership, certainly cannot win on its own.People are fed up with Brexit. They want it sorted. More than half the adult population want Out.This is natural Tory territory. All it needs is a decent leader.Right now, voters think ex-Tory Nigel Farage is the best on offer. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can’t simply take something off somebody and refuse to pay them the proper price.Nobody will shed a tear for the handsomely paid CEOs in Corbyn’s line of fire. But the damage will be felt by all of us. It is a matter of urgency that the Tory party wakes up to the threat.We are perilously close to finding out what socialism looks like in the st century — not in Venezuela but here at home.OUR military is renowned the world over as an elite fighting and humanitarian force.Such professionalism is only possible because of a structure of hard work and discipline in training and beyond.So the plan to encourage lags behind bars into the Army is a welcome one indeed.The values that run through our services are exactly the sort of thing that many a tearaway needs.We hope that the Army gives them a chance,they put in the hard yards, to turn their le around.And go from harming Britain to helping it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we need to find out what.”It wasn’t, however, until Gill Biggeloe was unmasked as the latest bad apple, that the episode really lost the plot.Firstly by trying to repeat series four’s “Urgent exit required” text trick.Then by turning sweet, little ginger Tina, who went for Biggeloe in the toilet with a kne, into a member of the OCG death cult. And finally by asking us to believe DI Cottan’s death twitches signalled four people were H.For some, I know, this will have been a step too far, but I’m still keeping the LoD faith.It may demand a lot of viewers and take risks, but that’s what all great dramas should do.And,some don’t come off, it’s one of the few home-made shows that can usually fall back on its script or the astonishing performances of its cast.Particular plaudits this series, of course, go to Adrian Dunbar who’s turned Superintendent Ted Hastings into a television legend and, in these crucyingly right-on times, reminded us how much the public still loves a strong male character.I don’t expect such an important message to register with BBC drama, where every overpaid moron in the building will be running around shouting: “We need a female Ted.” But that’s their funeral.Line Of Duty will still have over ten million viewers hooked, whenever it s, because, as we learned in the closing credits, its integrity, storyline and main characters all endure: Arnott’s been exonerated after shooting Tina.OCG member Ryan’s at police training college. Gill ­Biggeloe’s “been given a new identity”and flawed hero Ted Hastings is back in charge at AC- where he’s free to complete his Edge Park Hotel TripAdvisor review.“Faulty toilet, no guests, great wi-fi connection.”MY COLUMN s in a fortnight. In the meantime, can I recommend you watch the actor-to-stuntman handover, about four minutes into tonight’s EastEnders, as a topless Keanu escapes down Louise Mitchell’s drainpipe ’Costhat segment doesn’t win the Best Comedy Weight Loss category, something’s gone terribly wrong at next month’s Soap Awards.Piers Morgan: “My collar size used to be  and a half, it got to  and I didn’t like it.”And who would, on their first day at school But let’s talk about the here and now, Chunk.A MAJOR shock during the final episode of Channel ’s absorbing Sunday night series Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins.Rugby player Ben Foden voluntarily withdrew, during the interrogation phase, having been subjected to several hours of “disturbing and repetitive noises”.The one thing you’d think he was prepared for, after marrying one of The Saturdays.Whatever demons those ungodly howls awoke in Ben, they didn’t seem to bother Frankie Bridge’s husband Wayne, who’s been the obvious and deserving winner of the series since episode one.The final was still well worth an hour of your time, though, just to see the interrogation of Made In Cha’s Sam Thompson, whose endless backchat, sulking and general toddler antics went down every bit as well as you’d expect with the show’s battle-hardened Special Forces veterans.“Are you pulling a fookin’ face ” “No, Sir.” “Then stop being a fookin’ c*** then.”When verbal threats failed to register, the staff tried guilt-tripping him by menacing Victoria Pendleton with two alsatians.A tactic that probably went down badly with all those people who think the real SAS operates like a community outreach theatre group, pacying hostile forces through the medium of dance and mime.Personally, I thought the whole series was so brilliantly executed it should become an annual fixture, with celebrities forced to do it at gunpointnecessary.And,anyone disagrees, just try telling me you wouldn’t like to see Gemma Collins shoved out of a helicopter backwards.THIS Morning, April , “The woman who can predict the future by throwing asparagus”, Jemima Packington: “Meghan’s going to have the baby by the end of April. Twins, one boy, one girl. By the end of April.”And I’m sure the other one will be out any moment, Jemima.Glenn Hoddle: “The defender’s lying down completely flat with his legs in the air.”APOLOGIES for the recent lack of EastEnders updates.Five months seemed a safe enough gap to leave, and I’m pleased to report the coupling’s been forgotten by everyone – including Louise Mitchell, who was blackmailing Sharon over the affair.There now also seem to be more people living at the Slaters’ house than in Basingstoke – and Robert Kazinsky has even ed from Hollywood to reprise his role as Jean’s prodigal son Sean, having clearly benefited from the experience of landing such stellar parts as Randy in Hot Pursuit and George Jetson in Robot Chicken.The bad news, though, is that EastEnders is on to its sixth version of the endlessly useless Ben Mitchell and, having gone through his gay, incontinent ballet dancer phase, this one clearly thinks he’s Michael Caine, trying to put the heat on Lola’s Geordie boyfriend with this less-than-menacing line: “I’m gonna come up to Noocastle, to that grotty little flat, above that grotty little shop, in Westgate, and I’m gonna kill ya. Any questions ”Just one.How come you’re not deaf any more No. But it is a really terrible f***ing idea. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fair enough.Equally, no one was much bothered whether or not Meghan came out on the steps of a hospital  seconds after giving birth. Each to their own and all that.But being Hollywood-style “woke” means you can’t just quietly get on with it and let your actions speak for themselves.No, you have to make grand declarations about your right-on credentials, such as “climate change is a very important issue” or “racism is abhorrent” as , by not making such virtue-signalling statements, the rest of us disagree and need to be enlightened.And so, rather than just announcing the birth when it suited them, they issued a rather pompous and bewildering press release to tell us in advance that they wanted to “keep the plans around the arrival of their baby private”.Asthe Press and public were constantly banging on the door of their easily accessible, terraced house, demanding to knowlittle Wayne or Waynetta had arrived yet.This push-back, following as it did the very public ghosting of Meghan’s father Thomas, risked alienating those members of the public with a genuine fondness for the prince and his new we.But happily, all the nonsense was forgotten the moment Harry bounded in to the stables area at Windsor Castle, where a select few of the world’s media were assembled.As the horses behind him gazed disinterestedly into the middle distance, his obvious delight at becoming a father was written all over his face.This was the Labrador puppy-esque Harry of old, and thanks to his excellent “How women do that is beyond comprehension” remark, he’s now firmly reinstated as the uncomplicated, cheeky chappie we all have a soft spot for.So, a heartfelt congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on the birth of their first child.And moving forward, perhaps a little less of the stage-management and self-important virtue-signalling would be wise.In other words, take a leaf out of our admirable Queen’s book and just show us what you’re made of, rather than tell.PRINCESS CHARLOTTE celebrated her fourth birthday last week with a party at Kensington Palace.One can only imagine what a hot ticket that was at her primary school.Not among the children, silly. I mean the parents.The fevered anticipation at school pick-up time must have been palpable.Is there a gilt-edged stfyin the backpack or not Should they wait until they’re in the car before looking Or should they just fall to their knees in the playground right now for a spot of desperate, unseemly rummaging In the event, Prince William described it as “a rowdy party” which suggests that he and Kate swerved any potential breach of social etiquette by inviting the whole class. Phew.But of course, small children, the elderly or infirm would have had no chance in the face of such disastrous selfishness.QUEEN the band are now richer than our actual monarch following the worldwide success of their movie Bohemian Rhapsody.Guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor are the brains behind the biopic, which focuses on former frontman Freddie Mercury, who died in .But perhaps the smartest of them all is bassist John Deacon, who, despite being asked to be involved in the planning and production of the movie, didn’t even reply to the email – preferring to live a non-famous, quiet le in West London with his we and kids.While still benefiting from the enormous royalty cheques, of course.SO let’s get this straight. Former Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sacked from his post based on accusations from people unknown and “evidence” he’s not allowed to see.This Government is getting more like the Stasi with each passing day.EMMA THOMPSON has been branded a “first class hypocrite” after lecturing the rest of us on climate change then hopping on a commercial jet.Was she on a mercy mission to the socialist haven of Venezuela, where the political and economic crisis has resulted in violence and helpless families being wracked by poverty and death Nope, thought not. She was on her way to New York for business meetings.But hey, do as I say, not as I do. Isn’t that the luvvie way The surreptitiously taken photo of her in seat F was accompanied by exquisite detail of her Laurent-Perrier champagne and beef carpaccio consumption.And according to one report, her share of the carbon dioxide generated by the flight was “the same as that emitted by heating an average house for nine months”.While I could extrapolate for hourson climate change data and its possible outcomes and solutions, I instead find my attention drting towards the more compelling conundrum of . . . who nobbled Dame Emma at ,ft Given that the first-class compartment of the BA jet only seats , it has all the makings of an excellent TV mystery in which all the exits are sealed, Miss Marple comes on board, and the perpetrator is eventually unmasked.Except, in this case, they’d be a national hero.STRICTLY dancer Katya Jones has reportedly been demoted from having a celeb pairing in the next series because her snog with last year’s partner Seann Walsh was deemed “unprofessional” by BBC bosses. Yet there she is, currently strutting her stuff on the nation’s theatre stages as part of the brand’s offshoot tour called . . . Strictly Come Dancing: The Professionals.Go figure.DANIEL CRAIG’s hunky stuntman has been causing a few hot flushes among the nation’s menopausal women .Jean-Charles Rousseauhas been photographed on location in Jamaica, where filming has started on “Bond ”, as it’s currently known.He was driving a Land Rover, but quite how many other stunts he will perform on Mr Craig’s behalf remains to be seen.Meanwhile, it reminds me of the incorrigible Sir Roger Moore who, when I asked whether he used stuntmen during his time as Bond, replied: “Yes, but I did all my own love scenes.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was Tories specically.Indeed the new fly-on-the-wall EU documentary is a revealing portrait of the pompous, sneering, undemocratic bureaucrats .million of us voted to leave: mocking Brexit, our country, even our “war spirit”. That’s right, the war spirit that served us well as we helped to liberate Europe from Nazi tyranny.But for an insight into Verhofstadt’s blinkered stupidity look no further than a remark he made only yesterday.Turkey, he said, was “drting towards dictatorship” as its president orders the re-run of an election he lost.Precisely as Brussels does with its own defeats and is desperate to do with Brexit.WHAT is going through Theresa May’s mind  She cannot rescue this.Brexit deadlines come and go. More are set. Empty promises are made. They’ll be broken too.Her party and country are baying for her to step down. Her aides threaten legal action against her own MPs — as she tries to stitch up a deal with Corbyn neither his party nor hers will back.This utter shambles would be catastrophic enough for the Government without Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.

And right across Europe it is the new populist parties which will hold the whip hand come May . Electors are furious about uncontrolled immigration, tired of the bureaucratic EU and sick to the back teeth of social liberalism.Like never before they are backing the populists, in countless countries across the continent. They already now run Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary and Estonia, having come from almost nothing ten years ago. But in these Euro elections the change will be even more dramatic.Across Scandinavia, in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, more and more electors are deserting the centre parties for what the BBC, holding its nose between two fingers, likes to call the “far Right”.Largely nationalist parties which care about national sovereignty and do not care for immigration. Sometimes radical socialist parties which resent the bullying EU.The centrist liberals of the European People’s Party and the socialists are likely to be routed, a response to decades of mismanagement and arrogance. For the first time EVER they are unlikely to hold an overall majority.And the numbers of populists making headway will be swelled by our own generous contribution — because Nigel Farage is marching back to Brussels — and his Brexit Party will secure at least a few dozen seats on May . This is an enormous problem for the current, discredited, EU leadership.One Brussels panjan- drum said it would lead to “institutional paralysis” within the EU. My response to that is: How will we tell  But he is probably right.The new parties are opposed to everything the current administration stands for. They are Eurosceptics. They wish the EU to be a trading bloc, not a supranational government telling every country what to do.They are largely socially conservative. They have little truck with the identity politics of the liberals. And they hate uncontrolled immigration. This will lead to an enormous upheaval in Brussels.They’ve woken up and smelled the coffee. The liberals know that their cards have been marked. But what Europe faces is a year or two of wrangling as these new parties seek to exert influence over the EU.And it will be made worse by the fact that the European People’s Party is itself split over what to do about immigration. A good proportion of EPP members have woken up and smelled the coffee.It’s all a bit ironic, isn’t it  Three years ago we voted to leave the EU — for many of the reasons that have led to this surge for the populists on the European mainland.If the populists can gain control of some of the EU’s institutions, it might become a much more palatable organisation for British people.Ah well. But one thing is for sure. In the UK, in the US, in Brazil and in the EU, liberalism has had its day. Good riddance.SO – she’s called the kid Archie Harrison.  I’m like, wtf  It’s not very regal, is it Sounds like the name of a combative left back for Middlesbrough in about . “Oh and a very robust tackle from Harrison there, which has left Smith needing stitches and possibly a kidney transplant.”I knew Harry wouldn’t have a say in the matter. Arthur and James were among the favourites, but I had a cheeky bet on Jayden and Lee.Anyway, despite being only three days old, the kid has already performed a hugely valuable service to this country. He’s moved Prince Andrew down from seventh in line to the throne to eighth.HUGE respect to Liverpool for their astonishing comeback against Barcelona.A brilliant performance and it is always fun to see Lionel Messi sick as a parrot suffering from severe gastroenteritis and feather rot.That cheeky corner.

On his head would be a top hat with the slogan: “Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug.”He squandered a fortune in £ election deposits and seldom attracted more than a handful of votes, although in a  county council election he beat two Labour candidates. He called the result: “A Loony landslide.”His policies  To reduce immigration, he wanted vast photographs of Russell Brand and Katie Hopkins erected at British airports. These, he argued, would so terry new arrivals that they would leg it on the first plane home.People with stutters should receive  per cent discounts on their t-t-t-telephone bills. To combat obesity, superglue should be added to lip salves. And anyone convicted of homophobia should have to serve their sentence in drag.On the face of it, poor Toby, like his late pal and party leader Screaming Lord Sutch, seemed a crackpot. That was the conventional verdict.But the longer you look at them, the less loopy Lords Jug and Sutch start to look. Were they possibly not more sane than many of our “real” politicians It’s not asJug smashed mobile phones against the wall , shaved the back of his hands Peter Mandelson, or travelled by sledge to the Arctic Circle for a photoshoot with huskies vain nincompoop David Cameron.And Toby Jug certainly missed a trick by never granny-dancing on to a party conference stage to the strains of Abba. We had to wait for “dependable” dullard Theresa May to do that.Mrs May or Lord Toby Jug: Which was more deserving of being carted away by the men in white coats Which was closer to the public’s views  Don’t be a mug, vote Toby Jug. And that was a better slogan, was it not, than Mrs May’s daft, delusional  General Election claim that she was “strong and stable” She croaked it like a demented parrot. “Strong and stable” turned out to be as truthful as some fruitcake who marches along your high street claiming to be the King of Prussia.Our politicians love to pose as shrewd sentries outside the nation’s coffers. They boast about their cleverness and financial acumen and yet they propose blowing £billion — more likely £billion, say sceptics — on a swanky new railway line that may reduce journey times between London and Birmingham by just a few minutes. Few voters want the HS line yet MPs press on with it. Nuts.Mrs May, who is forever lecturing the poor about how our tight public finances bind her hands on necessary spending, gaily proposes giving the EU a £billion cheque for almost nothing in .Does the House of Commons pin her down and ask her what the blazes she is doing  Nope.Who is the bonkers one here  It wasn’t Jug who, hoping to look virtuous, told police to reduce stop and search, a decision which was followed by a dreadful rise in kne murders of black kids. That was another crazy policy of the turbulent, scowling, almost catatonic T May.If you meet MPs, as we politics reporters must, you will hear them say that our PM “has lost it” and “needs help”. These are not poor-taste jibes about mental health. They genuinely believe Mrs May is unwell. Yet they will not remove her from an office in which she has command of our Armed Forces. Who’s pottier here  Mrs May, or the MPs who indulge her Take a look at the  General Election manesto of the Monster Raving Loony Party. One of its policies was: “We will introduce votes at .” They clearly thought that was a comically absurd idea. Today it is national policy in Scotland and is supported for the rest of the country by the Labour Party.Another  Monster Raving Loony proposalwas: “Solving the problem of over-crowding in prisons by releasing all innocent prisoners.”Our political class has gone one better than this. It has sought to solve prison crowding by releasing GUILTY prisoners.Then there was the Loonies’ idea to give House of Lords seats to: “Anyone who writes a problem page in a national newspaper.” Daft, of course. Instead, Labour gave a peerage to minor TV personalityAlan Sugar.The last gem from the  Loonies’ manesto was a promise to hold: “A referendum on whether people want a referendum on Europe.”Good joke — except that it has come horribly true. We were told our  EU referendum was a “once-in-a-letime” chance to decide whether or not to stay in the EU.Many MPs now want to block that poll’s Leave result and say it was merely a rehearsal for another referendum.Nurse, we need more straitjackets here!RIP, Lord Toby Jug.

He said that [Archie] slept for the first  hours like all babies do . . . and then he woke up.“Like any father he’s learning the hard way that you have to celebrate the moments of joy and endure the rest of it. He’s already changed some nappies.“I said to him that when my daughter came home from hospital three years ago she slept all the way home and for ten minutes in the house. And she then opened her eyes and never went back to sleep.”Harry and former marine JJ, , have become friends since the first games in .JJ added: “I see the guy with a buzzing smile on his face still.

At the time there was a lot of anger towards dad because he was doing a terrible thing.“Just before he was raided he was so ill I thought he’d be dead in six months.”The software consultant has written a book, Breaking Dad, about the experience of seeing his “solid, reliable” father transform into a drug addicted mess.He is in talks with both film companies and TV producers about adapting the remarkable story for the screen - with many noting its similarity to the hit US drama Breaking Bad, about mild mannered chemistry teacher turned meth dealer Walter White.The book tells how Richard split from James’s mum, Marilyn, moved out of their suburban home in North West London and suffered a very dangerous, late le crisis.Embracing his new found identity, Richard shaved his head, started going to clubs, wearing tank tops, smoking cannabis and taking ecstasy.Soon he moved on to the far more addictive crystal meth, which he not only encouraged his son to try, but he also shared with pop star George Michael.With things spiralling totally out of control Richard put black bin bags on the windows of his trendy east London apartment to hide from the world that he was selling the white crystalline drug day and night.When the police smashed down the door of the pad in  in an armed raid they found £.million worth of crystal meth.And -year-old Richard was convicted as a most unconventional Mr Big.Growing up, the worst offence Richard committed as far as his son was concerned was telling the same bad dad jokes over and over again.When James was  his mum and dad separated following  years of marriage in what was an ”amicable split.”Seven years later, in , James discovered why their marriage hadn’t worked out - both his parents were gay.His dad invited him to a restaurant with “important news” and never in a million years would James have guessed that was going to be the revelation.James says: “I didn’t see it coming. He was a bit of a ladies man, loads of women flocked to him, he was a good raconteur. I thought it was a positive thing that he came out, it meant he could be who he really was.”That was a relief to Richard, who had been incredibly nervous about revealing his real sexuality.The -year-old retired businessman explains: “Telling my son I was gay was probably the most dficult thing I have had to do. I wasn’t proud of it.”Then two weeks later James’s mum invited him for lunch at a restaurant, ironically called the Gay Hussar, to come out as well.James recalls: “She had already moved in with her long term partner Ruth. I thought it was a little bit unusual, but I thought they are probably both lonely and they were good friends.“She said ‘we’re more than friends, I’m gay too.’”Remarkably, neither Richard nor Marilyn could believe the other one was gay. They’d gone through their marriage oblivious to their true leanings.The new le as a single man was the catalyst for Richard’s descent into a world of drugs.He says: “I was away in South Africa on a business trip and gay friends invited me to a party and they said ‘you have to take a pill.’ I didn’t know what that meant.“When I took the pill I thought I was dying. I couldn’t move, but then a friend helped me. It was ecstasy.”As a young, single man James wasn’t adverse to dabbling with cannabis and ecstasy during the rave explosion of the nineties.But he would never have expected his ageing dad to invite him to a trance and hard house night at The Fridge club in Brixton, south London.After initially saying no, James’s friend dragged him along.Still looking traumatised by the experience a decade on, James says: “I went in there and there he was in his tank top pogoing up and down with a girl who was more our age.“He was obviously on E at the time. I was cringing a bit.”The more time James spent with his dad, the more worried he became about his strange behaviour.First he saw a huge bag of cannabis in his dad’s flat, which made him worry he was dealing, and then during a trip to Los Angeles together his dad took crystal meth at a rock gig.Back then it was a relatively new drug and James hadn’t heard of it.Richard quickly became addicted to the illegal substance which cost £ a gram.He said: “It got more and more. I was dependent on it.”Drawn further into the scene, he met more and more people using meth pipes. They included George Michael, whose house in Hampstead, London, he visited with a friend.The problem was classical music fan Richard had no idea who the  million record selling artist was.Taking crystal meth with a well known abuser of drugs was one thing - but offering it to his son was another.The younger Lubbock had seen the pipe in his dad’s flat and the senior one asked: “Do you want to try some ”Being curious and in a ‘who cares ’ state of mind, James said yes.He says: “I thought it might be an interesting father son bonding experience.”To this day, it remains his dad’s deepest regret.Richard confesses: “One feeling upsets me more than anything, and it was ‘how could I do that  How could I offer crystal meth to my son ’”While James managed to keep his le together, never getting hooked on drugs, his dad’s addiction only got worse.When Marilyn, who he still loved and never orced, died from oian cancer at the age of  in  Richard went totally off the rails.James says: “His health was deteriorating rapidly. He was bed ridden with gum infections.”All efforts to convince his dad to slow down, or at least stop dealing, fell on deaf ears.Richard did little to hide the extent of his drug operation, with people openly coming in and out of his flat at all times of the day.He says: “Friday night, Saturday night I couldn’t get out of my flat so many people were buying drugs.I used to joke, some joke, ‘I feel like I’m in a prison here.’ I didn’t expect for one second I’d go to prison, even though others were warning me I would.”He wasn’t the only middle class, older person risking his le by inhaling the banned substance, with his customers including professionals and civil servants.But the police were onto him and in December  they raided his Limehouse flat.When he appeared in court he pleaded guilty and was handed an eight year prison sentence.Time inside was exactly what this mixed-up dealer needed.He explains: “I didn’t expect to live for more than a week in prison, but the absence of the drug I couldn’t do without was what I needed. I think prison saved my le.”Richard proved to be a model prisoner, helping as an English teaching assistant and getting on well with the other prisoners.After four years he was released from jail and meeting this politely spoken man today you wouldn’t suspect his criminal past.Despite all the stress and pain, father and son have become closer due to what they went through.Breaking Dad, published by Mirror Books, is in book shops now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Meghan loved playing with him and she was always talking about him to her friends.“It’s no surprise she named her new baby Archie.

This would mean you draw a line.“If the ICC agree, there can be this line in the sand drawn of a presumption of no prosecution after ten yearsno new evidence comes forward.“That I think would be an absolute positive step.“We then move forward from the ridiculous situation where people who have been retired for two or three decades are now having to scratch their heads as to what on earth happened in a particular incident on a particular evening.”Mr Ellwood said the ten-year limit would apply “across the board” but stressed that new evidence could allow a prosecution — a move he called “fair”.The legal bid is being driven by the MoD, the Northern Ireland Office and the Attorney General.Mr Ellwood added: “Absolutely we need to improve the investigations, which we are honouring purely because of the Good Friday Agreement.“This is going back before the Conservatives’ time — in recognising that there were some specic cases that families of those affected wanted to be looked into.“And it was on both sides of the equation, both on the terrorist side and some questions to do with British forces’ behaviour too.“What is unacceptable is  years after somebody has served you’re getting knocks on doors, and we need to move forward from that quickly.”Col Richard Kemp, ex-Commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, said: “If the law is the reason these brave men are being hounded, the law must change.”And SAS hero Andy McNab said a time limit on bringing prosecutions was “the only logical way out”.The legal moves were revealed after Mr Mercer reignited the debate with his letter to Theresa May, sent on Wednesday.He said he was not prepared to vote for Government legislation, except on Brexit, until it took “clear and concrete steps” to end the “abhorrent process”.Mr Mercer has spoken out against the pursuit of legacy cases from the conflicts in Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iraq since entering Parliament in .But his intervention will be seen in Westminster as further evidence of the PM’s crumbling authority.Mr Mercer recently accused the Tory whips office of contacting former Army comrades in an effort to dig up dirt on him.He said it had left him feeling that his “values and ethos may be slowly, but very firmly, separating from a party I joined in ”.A spokesman said Mrs May is “fully aware of the strength of feeling” over the prosecutions, adding the system “needs to change to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors of the Troubles”.Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt also said ending the hounding of troops was a “personal priority” for her.She said: “This has dragged on for far too long and it is time for action.”LAST Monday I got a phone call from Dennis Hutchings. He sounded at his wits’ end, indeed almost tearful.He told me his kidneys had now completely failed — but he had turned down treatment in order to defend himself against charges of attempted murder in Northern Ireland almost half a century ago. I didn’t know what to say.In  the Prime Minister spoke in her conference speech about ending the pursuit of our “brave men and women”. They are words which have made me wince every time I have heard them from a political leader in the last  years, because I know that they mean so very little.It was that precise injustice — the gap between words and actions from our political leaders towards those who have or are serving — that drove me to seek elected office despite never having voted before.Servicemen and women do not rally against the Government. Their professionalism, service, ethos and loyalty to the Crown prevent them. But they are angry. Very angry.Many veterans are not in Dennis’s health — they are worse. Some have dementia. Some do not even understand what is going on. I speak with their horried wives and children.I cannot accurately convey the seething injustice this represents as a way to treat those who have volunteered to protect and fight for the freedoms and privileges we have enjoyed in this nation over the years.The Government is capable of taking action and demonstrating leadership .There are options — for instance a ten-year time limitation before a “presumption not to prosecute” without compelling new evidence.And sometimes doing nothing is an option too. And that is a choice this administration has taken, and one which I cannot support.It has nothing to do with the wider Conservative Party. A good, modern, competent, centre-right, forward-looking Conservative Party would have sorted this some time ago.We are the party of Defence. These are our people.Most of our members, most of our voters, are appalled by this process.We do the right thing by our servicemen and women, evenI have to drag us kicking and screaming over the line.SOLDIER F was charged in March with two murders during Bloody Sunday, sparking outrage.The unnamed ex-Para, now in his s, is accused over the deaths of James Wray and William McKinney and the attempted murder of four others on January , .While a number of soldiers admit killing protestors, only one faces trial.

The world has waited excitedly to meet Meghan Markle and Prince Harrys new baby boy - Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.Archie was born on Monday at .am, weighing lb oz, but the Duke and Duchess of Sussex chose to spend the first couple of days with him in private. As the new parents eventually posed with their son yesterday in St Georges Hall at Windsor Castle, they couldnt contain their joy.They spoke of their first moments with Archie as \"amazing\" and \"special\" and said they were thrilled to have their own little bundle of joy. Harry cradled Archie, wrapped in a white blanket, as a supportive Meghan put her arm around them and looked dotingly at her two best guys in the world. Here are all the best photos of the new family-of-three. The first glimpse of Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor who was born on Monday at .am, and was thought to be about a week overdue.  of The Queen and Prince Philip beamed as they met their eighth great-grandchild for the first time, along with Meghans mum Doria Ragland who looked every inch the doting gran as she peered over daughter s shoulder and gazed lovingly at her new grandson.  of Appearing for the first time after giving birth, the Duchess of Sussex wore a white dress from designer Grace Wales Bonner, who has a British mother and Jamaican father.  of Meghan told how her son has the sweetest temperament and that hes really calm - to which Harry replied I dont know who he gets that from, sending them both into giggles.  of The former actress appeared in awe of little Archie and said hes just been the dream, so its been a special couple of days.  of Meghan said they are still trying to figure out who he takes after, with Harry adding that his looks are changing every single day, so who knows.  of The glowing Duchess said she felt happy to have the best two guys in the whole world and could not hide her joy.  of The -year-old former Suits actress is used to the limelight - but many thought even she looked a little nervous as the new family faced the worlds media.  of A small press pool of only one reporter, one photographer and three cameramen were present along with the couples own private photographer and a household press officer photographer.  of The tot made his debut wrapped in a white merino wool shawl and white cashmere hat, knitted by a small, family-run company which was also used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for their children.  of Harry, dressed in a light grey suit, cradled his son who was tucked up in the hand-finished shawl made by the Nottingham company GH Hurt  Son, based in Chilwell.  of Meghan wore a gold and turquoise gem necklace by Jen Meyer and earrings by Adina Reyter. Turquoise is regarded as the love charm and is also a symbol of good fortune and success - maybe hinting at her love and hopes for health and happiness for her son.  of The press were told they had just  seconds to get their photos and a reporter could then ask three questions, however, the Duke and Duchess didnt rush them along and in the end the whole thing lasted three minutes.  of Meghan and Harry had wanted to take the photos on the steps behind Windsor Castle, in the same spot they posed for one of their official wedding pictures, but typical British weather meant this wasnt possible.  of Archie is seventh in line to the throne, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburghs eighth great-grandchild and the Prince of Waless fourth grandchild.  of Meghan has been praised by women around the world for helping to normalise how a new mums stomach looks after childbirth by not hiding her bump. of Meghan and Harry revealed the babys name just a few hours after meeting the press.

This is very modern stuff, in line with the contemporary image the royals are keen to promote. “Being there for baby” has become absurdly fashionable. Dads insist on being at the midwe’s elbow through the whole gory process of childbirth. “Bonding with baby” they call it.   But men often get in the way. In his brilliant best-seller This Is Going To Hurt, former obstetrician Adam Kay relates how one father insisted on being first to touch the baby - even though it was a caesarean section.Another was “dicking around on a birthing ball and fell off, cracking his skull on the ground”. And one fool kept cracking jokes, culminating in “ever had a baby come out a dferent colour to the parents ” “Does blue count ” he replied. Ouch! That shut him up. With our first, I was only allowed to look at her through a glass screen. Men weren’t allowed anywhere near the labour ward. Next time, I was there for Josephine, but only because she arrived prematurely – in the kitchen, on the spare bed from which I’d just evicted the lodger.

The Home Office has already pushed back the planned switch off of the existing Airwave system by three years, to . But a report from the National Audit Office raised doubts over whether the replacement for Airwave, the Emergency Services Network , will be ready by the new target date. The project is expected to cost £. billion more than initially planned, while key technology for ESN is not yet proven in real-world conditions, the NAO said. It concluded that the Home Officeaposs management of the programme has led to delays, increased costs and poor value for taxpayers.  Sir Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: The success of the Emergency Services Network is critical to the day-to-day operations of our emergency services that keep us all safe. The Home Office needs a comprehensive plan with a realistic timetable that properly considers risks and uncertainties. It has already been through one costly reset and is in danger of needing another unless it gets its house in order. Since , emergency services have communicated using a dedicated digital radio network known as Airwave. It is used by all  police, fire and ambulance services in England, Scotland and Wales, for communications between control rooms and teams in the field, as well as  other organisations such as local authorities and train operating companies.    In , the Home Office decided to replace Airwave with ESN. The new service is intended to match Airwave in all respects, allow users to take advantage of high-speed mobile data and save money by sharing an existing commercial G network. It had been expected that emergency services would start using ESN in September , with the transition being completed at the end of this year. But the NAO said that by , the Home Office realised its plan was not achievable. Last year the department announced a reset of its approach, based on a phased introduction of ESN services, rather than launching the whole programme at once. The new plan is for Airwave to be switched off in December . But the NAOaposs report said: There are still signicant risks and, based on past performance, it seems unlikely that ESN can be delivered by the target date of . The Home Office now predicts that ESN will cost £. billion, £. billion more than the sum forecast in . Of this rise, £. billion is the cost of extending Airwave, £. billion is an increase in contingency and the rest of the programme is now forecast to cost £. billion more. The NAO described the revised forecast costs as highly uncertain. Technology needed to allow emergency services to communicate effectively using ESN is not yet ready, according to the watchdog. It said aircraft are currently unable to receive the signal needed to communicate with those on the ground and devices are unable to communicate directly with one another without a network signal. The NAO acknowledged that the Home Officeaposs reset has addressed some of the programmeaposs issues by adopting a staged approach to the roll-out, replacing a key piece of technology, strengthening management teams and processes, and re-negotiating contracts. While ESN is expected to be cheaper than Airwave in the long-run, savings will not outweigh costs until at least , the report found. It concluded: To date, the Home Officeaposs management of this critical programme has represented poor value for money.    Meg Hillier, chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: The Emergency Services Network is to be used by police, firefighters and ambulance crews for the communications they need to do their le-saving jobs. The Home Office must take an urgent and honest examination of its ability to deliver to its new schedule for this critical project. A Home Office spokeswoman said ESN is on track to deliver an ambitious, world-leading digital communications network for the emergency services by , resulting in savings of £ million a year. The spokeswoman said: It is already allowing people to make  calls from areas where it was previously impossible, with almost  new masts built so far in some of the most remote areas of Britain. When fully implemented, its mobile technology and infrastructure will transform the emergency response of police officers, firefighters and ambulance crews. This will result in faster and better treatment for victims. Motorola Solutions, one of the main contractors to the ESN programme, said it is committed to working with the Home Office to deliver the Emergency Services Network as we move toward delivering the next generation of public safety to the UK, adding: We continue to work closely with the Home Office and other partners throughout the incremental roll-out of the programme to ensure a smooth transition for emergency services across the UK.

Brexiteer Esther McVey, known as a slasher when she ran the welfare department, was the latest to throw her hat in the ring. The PM has refused calls to quit before her Brexit deal is finally agreed but is being urged by Tory MPs to say when she will go.She is already facing a Tory mutiny after last week’s local election thrashing and party chiefs fear a wipeout in the European elections.But her plan to press ahead with her own Brexit plan looks almost impossible as no deal with Labour is in sight.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said concerns about a future Tory leader abiding by any agreement were a major problem.    “Every time we have had that discussion, there have been noises off from the ious leadership candidates for the Conservative Party which have undermined confidence in any agreement surviving more than a couple of months,” he said. Ministers also confirmed that MPs would disappear for an -day half-term recess just after the elections on May . It means the earliest Brexit legislation could be debated -it gets Labour backing - would be well into June.  Mrs May met with the hardline DUP’s Arlene Foster yesterday to try to finally win her support for the plan.   Leaver Boris Johnson is favourite among Tory members but born-again Brexiteer Jeremy Hunt is doing well among MPs. Senior Remainer cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who is being courted as a runnig mate, warned that any future Tory leader whobacked a No Deal Brexit would fail to command a majority in Parliament. And on BBC Newsnight she told colleagues: “This shouldn’t be some Game of Thrones push for the Iron Throne. We’ve all got important jobs to do. Let’s deliver on those.”    Ms Rudd also criticised Tory colleagues like Mr Hunt and Dominic Raab who had “paraded” their partners in the media. “Don’t wind me up just because it is all the men putting themselves forward at the moment,” she said. There are more than a dozen Tory MPs currently considering running but despite the crowded field there is not yet any vacancy. But Mrs May could eventually be forced out by her Cabinetthe EU elections results are as devastating for the Tories as expected.  Justice secretary David Gauke admitted that voters will “kick” the Tories in the poll.  But in a dig at Brexiteers including Mr Johnson, warned the party against populism and “yearning for a mythical” past. Confirming her bid, Ms McVey said: “I’ve always said quite clearlyI got enough support from colleagues then yes I would, and now people have come forward and I have got that support. So I will be going forward.” She joins cabinet ministers Andrea Leadsom and Rory Stewart who have publicly declared they want the top job.

Miley Timmermans was just two years old when her parents, Samantha and Jan were told she had a condition so rare that her parents had no idea what it was. “When they first said it was CdLS I said ‘what on Earth is that ’ said Samantha, also a mum to Jayden, , and Bobby, age one.“It was a bit of a relief when we found out, reports Lincolnshire Liv e.Miley was diagnosed with rare Cornelia de Lange Syndromeand she has managed to defy doctorsapos expectations.  While she was late in learning - she can walk. The little girl can talk too -only in three to five-word sentences.  Her mum has spoken of the familyaposs relief in having a diagnosis they could work out how to live with. “When she was six months old she went to hospital with a tummy bug and the nurses said: ‘why have we never seen this child before  She is tiny.’ “Once we had a name it was a relief as before that it was unknown so it was hard to know what they were checking for. “Now we know to an extent what we are facing.” The condition is caused by a genetic mutation and affects a person’s growth and causes speech and learning dficulties. Samantha says there only  people have the condition in England. In Miley’s case, she has grown at a much slower rate to her two brothers, who don’t have the condition, and also has learning dficulties.  There is not much information available about the condition, but there are cases where those diagnosed have gone on to live happy, independent lives. And Samantha, a mum-of-three, says she is optimistic about her now-six-year-old daughter’s future. It is hard to know,” said the -year-old when asked what to expect going forward. “They couldn’t tell usor when she’d walk. They couldn’t predict when orshe’d talk as a lot of children with CdLS don’t talk.  “At the moment she is exceeding all they said she would do.” The family, who live in Fernwood near Newark, have been particularly grateful to the help and support of CdLS Foundation. The not-for-profit organisation has proven to be a real strong network of support, providing the parents with information about the condition, as well as putting them in touch with doctors, who have worked closely with the syndrome before. One of those was particularly helpful in helping a diagnosis being given for Miley. However, the charity doesn’t get any funding and is reliant on donations from anyone who can. Samantha and her family are keen to help and have held a number of fundraising events in the past. Next on the list is a fundraising event at Miley’s school, Chute Ede Primary, where pupils will don the colour purple and donate a pound to help a cause so close to Samantha’s heart. “CdLS get no funding from anyone,” she said. “The foundation really have by providing the conferences they’ve really helped us understand Miley’s syndrome so much more. “It helps other kids get diagnosed as well.”To donate to the foundation click here."},{"url":null,"title":"first picture retired teacher church","story":"NewsFirst picture of retired teacher and church warden lover accused of his murderBen Field, , and Peter Farquhar, , lived together and shared a bed each night at the home in the village of Maids Moreton in Buckinghamshire, a court heardShareByCharlie MoloneyJames Gale:,  MAY NewsPeter Farqhuarand Benjamin Field \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThis is the first picture of a retired teacher and his young lover who is accused of murdering him by feeding him drugs and alcohol in a bid to get his inheritance. Ben Field, , is on trial over the death of Peter Farquhar, , which happened in October  and months after they held a gay aposbetrothalapos ceremony to celebrate their engagement. Mr Farquhar wrote in his diary afterwards: It is one of the happiest moments of my le. Gone are the fears of dying alone. The private event in March  took place at St Maryaposs Church, West Hampstead and a photo of the couple from the day was shown to a jury today. The court was told the pair lived together and shared a bed each night at the home in the village of Maids Moreton in Buckinghamshire.  They had met at the University of Buckingham when Mr Farquhar was a guest lecturer and Field was a student.    They went on to mark their relationship with the aposbetrothal ceremonyapos, the jury heard. At Oxford Crown Court this afternoon, Oliver Saxby QC told the jury of six men and six women the couple had exchanged knives as part of the ceremony. In an excerpt from Mr Farquharaposs diary, the jury heard: We took the train to London, to a church in Hammersmith. To have this wonderful young man in my le until I die... It was a beautul day in London. God is good to me. Far more than I deserve. In another image shown to jurors, the couple had exchanged knives and a ring as gts marking their union.  In journal entry read to the jury by Mr Saxby QC and Detective Sergeant Richard Earl, who appeared in the witness stand, Mr Farquhar wrote: Hewants to make a commitment and live here - thank you God. A kne is the wedding ring of brotherhood. At the end of the hearing, the jury were shown an image of the couple standing on a hilltop after sealing their relationship.

Mr Farquhar had his food spiked with drugs, jurors heard.  The retired English teacher and lecturer had been besotted with his young lover, and had grown increasingly dependent as his health deteriorated, the court was told. The prosecutor said most people assumed Mr Farquhar had drunk himself to death, including a coroner who conducted an investigation into his death. After Mr Farquhar died, Field collected the inheritance of £, and his property. Smith collected £,, the court heard. The pair were also accused of attempting to murder -year-old Ann Moore-Martin, who was a neighbour and lived just a couple of doors down the road. Field was also in a sexual relationship with her. Field, of Wellingborough Road, Olney, is charged with one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of conspiracy to murder, one count of burglary, three counts of fraud and one count of possession of an article for use in fraud. He has admitted the three fraud counts and the burglary. Smith, of Penhalvean, Redruth, Cornwall, denies all the charges against him - one count of murder, one count of attempted murder, one count of conspiracy to murder, three counts of fraud, one count of burglary and one count of possession of an article for use in fraud, namely the will of an -year-old woman called Elizabeth Zettl, who Field lodged with. Also in the dock was Tom Field, , of Wellingborough Road, Olney, Bucks, who is Ben Fieldaposs brother. He was charged with fraud by  representation.

Experts reckon  million Brits will show symptoms and warn that cases have been rising steadily for decades after an “allergy explosion”. In the s, only % of the population were hit but % of adults and % of children are now sufferers. We are now in the top three countries for the highest allergy incidences. And a study in health journal Lancet Planetary Health says signicantly longer and more intense pollen seasons, driven by rising temperatures, will only make things worse.    The work by US scientist Lewis Ziska and colleagues from  other countries looked at airborne pollen data from  sites across the globe, covering an average  years. It states that “long-term data indicate signicant increases in both pollen loads and pollen season duration over time”. It also highlights an important link between “ongoing global warming and public health – one that could be exacerbated as temperatures continue to increase”. Max Wiseberg, an airborne allergens expert and creator of HayMax allergen barrier balms, said: “The study shows something we have already noticed – we are having longer pollen seasons and they are more intense.   Although this is bad news for people with hay fever , the good news is that we have ways to deal with it. Antihistamine tablets can relieve most symptoms but are less effective for nasal congestion.“Steroid nasal sprays can help and work best for symptoms including itching, sneezing, watering and congestion.” "},{"url":null,"title":"laughing woman hurls kitten against","story":"NewsLaughing woman hurls kitten against wall in front of kid in sick Snapchat videoWARNING - UPSETTING CONTENT The tiny animal can be seen somersaulting in the air after being tossed by the womanShareCommentsByJamie Munn:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video laughing-woman-hurls-kitten-against-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShocking video has emerged showing a giggling woman hurl a kitten against a wall - with what appears to be a young child watching on.

Julia, a -year-old YouTuber and singer, met -year-old political correspondent on Tinder last year. They both insist it was love at first sight and they have been inseparable ever since.Julia said: “We will not let any haters stop us because we just love each other.    “When I saw Eileen in person for the first time, I was just in awe of her because she is just the most gentle and lovely person ever. “She made me feel so good and she is just captivating.” Despite being together for less than a year the couple have moved in together and have even got a kitten.  Eileen said: “We are together because we are together and the age gap is something a reality but it is not something that I was looking for. “I wasn’t looking for a relationship at all, in fact, I was very happy on my own.”    Julia added: “I really think that age is just a number. “It’s really great and refreshing to find someone that is such a good match with me and is so similar to me in many ways.” Their age gap has never been an issue for the couple even when they’re mistaken for being a grandmother and her granddaughter. Eileen said: “We do get that thing a lot about mommy and grandmother. “It does offend me but I kind of understand that this person’s frame of reference is very narrow and I feel sorry for them.  “But it does make me upset a little bit.” Julia added: “I think we get hate comments mostly because of our age dference but also because we are gay and there are unfortunately still a lot of homophobic people out there.” And their age gap certainly doesnapost affect their sex le. The two aren’t shy sharing intimate details of their love le and say their sex le is great. Eileen said: “Julia and I have an extraordinarily good sex le, I have never been with somebody who is as exciting as her and fun as hell.”  Julia added: “I used to think that most older women wouldn’t be very sexually active or wouldn’t be that interested in sex le but I guess I was wrong.” Before flying to Julia’s home country Brazil to meet her partneraposs mother for the very first time, the -year-old admitted: “Some people think it is a bit weird that my mom is a few years younger than Eileen but it doesn’t bother me I think it is just a number.” Julia’s mother, Ingrid Sellge - who is eight years younger than her daughter’s partner – was extremely anxious about meeting Eileen for the first time. But after meeting her daughter’s older lover at the airport, she told Barcroft TV: “I didn’t imagine that Julia would have a girlfriend so much older but it’s not a problem for me. “I enjoyed a lot meeting Eileen and I was already used to the idea - and her being happy, for me is what matters.”  Julia and Eileen say that they have received nothing but support from both their families. Julia said: “[My family] know that Eileen makes me so happy, so that is all that matters, and that is what they want, they just want my happiness. “I know things have moved quite fast with us but sometimes it is just the way it is.” Despite their almost -year gap, the pair are planning their future together and have learnt to not let the judgement from others bother them and their romance. Julia said: “Sometimes we do worry about the future, Eileen most likely won’t live as long as me, it just really breaks my heart to think that we can’t grow old together.”  Eileen added: “We’ve talked about this, of course, but it’s a very hard thing to talk about. “I thought, long and hard, should I not get in this relationship  “Do I have a responsibility to turn around and say no  “Because there is such a big age dference. “Or does one just grab love and just take the responsibility of the knowledge in this situation  “We are together because we love each other, as Julia very beautully said once: ‘We couldn’t not be together’.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man named danny baker targeted","story":"NewsWrong Danny Baker targeted by vicious trolls confusing him with shamed BBC starThe Twitter user has pleaded for people to stop sending him abuse - and branding him a “racist scumbag” after the real Danny Baker posted a photo of a monkey after the birth of the royal babyShareCommentsByEmmeline SaundersAmber Hicks:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video danny-disappointed-way-bbc-handled-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man named Danny Baker has become the target of keyboard warriors confusing him for the sacked BBC star.

It was met with backlash as users believed Danny was mocking the Duchess of Sussexaposs racial heritage. Just got fired from @bbclive. For the record - it was red sauce. Always, he tweeted this morning.  Remaining unrepentant, Danny added: The call to fire me from bbclive was a masterclass of pompous faux-gravity.

In a second tweet, Baker wrote: Sorry my gag pic of the little fella in the posh outfit has whipped some up. Never occurred to me because, well, mind not diseased.  Soon as those good enough to point out it’s possible connotations got in touch, down it came. And thataposs it. Now stand by for sweary football tweets.

He wrote: Connection never occurred to me till people were good enough to enlighten. Little fella in posh suit. Anyway, deleted now.    The presenter had spent the morning answering his door to members of the media asking him about the tweet. Before his tweet about being fired, he wrote: Here we go.

It began as a small hole around the size of a dinner plate first reported beside the Inland Coast Path on Bronkham Hill, West Dorset, in February. The hole was investigated by Dorset Councilaposs ranger team and then geologists. They found that the small hole was covering a chasm that has the potential to be up to  feet wide and  feet deep. A barrier was put up and the restricted byway was temporarily closed. That small surface hole has since opened up to become a huge sinkhole. While it may look alarming, the local council says the hole does appear to be stable according to assessments. John Sellgren, executive director for Place at Dorset Council, said: When this hole was first reported we took action as we knew it could indicate a chasm of unknown depth.  Safety precautions were taken, and an investigation was carried out. I am happy to report that the sinkhole now appears stable and the National Trail is open. Sinkholes occur naturally but our advice is always take care andyou have concerns report them to Dorset Council. Sinkholes are rare in Dorset, but have occurred throughout history at Bronkham Hill, which is north-east of Portesham. They occur naturally when the surface layer of land collapses into ancient hollows formed during the last Ice Age. This particular sink hole is believed to have been caused during the last major glacial period where meltwater dissolved the rocks below. At Bronkham Hill, which is part of the Dorset Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, rainwater seeps through the surface flint and gravel and dissolves the porous chalk beneath. Around  steep-grass lined pits can be found nearby, known as aposelliptical dolinesapos. These are sink holes of the past which have now grassed over.

Rob Jones, , and Craig Paul, , discovered the , Roman coins inside a ceramic pot buried in a rural field. Experts say the hoard is the biggest haul of copper alloy coins ever found in Britain. But early estimates suggest it will be valued in the region of £, - because it does not contain any silver or gold. Engineering teacher Rob said he and planner Craig began digging after their metal detectors started beeping. Rob said: I couldnapost believe what I was seeing. Iaposve found a few things before, but absolutely nothing on this scale. I was totally amazed.    Finding the coins was the ultimate experience that we will never forget. Itaposs an incredibly humbling experience knowing that when you discover something like this, the last time someone touched it was nearly , year ago. I was completely flabbergasted. Rob and Craig spent years painstakingly searching a wide area of land near the village of Rauceby, Lincs. In July  the friends, who both live in Lincolnshire, struck aposgoldapos when they stumbled upon the coins. The pot holding them had been buried in a large pit lined with limestone. Craig helped carry out an archaeological investigation at the site, when a further  coins were also discovered. He said: To be there and see the pot appear out of the ground was really something. I never expected that there would be a second smaller hoard - that was just a bonus and really got us asking questions.” Experts believe the presence of the limestone pit suggests the coins were buried deliberately as part of a ceremony. Lincolnshire County Council archaeologist Dr Adam Daubney said: The coins were found in a ceramic pot, which was buried in the centre of a large oval pit – lined with quarried limestone. What we found during the excavation suggests to me that the hoard was not put in the ground in secret, but rather was perhaps a ceremonial or votive offering. The Rauceby hoard is giving us further evidence for so-called aposritualapos hoarding in Roman Britain. The coins, many of which are historically unique, are believed to have been buried around AD , following the death of the emperor Constantius in York. Dr Eleanor Ghey, curator of Iron Age and Roman Coin Hoards at the British Museum, said: Roman coins had begun to be minted in London for the first time. As the largest fully recorded find of this date from Britain, it has great importance for the study of this coinage and the archaeology of Lincolnshire. The hoard was officially declared treasure earlier this month at Lincoln Coroneraposs Court. It is currently being examined by the British Museum and will be valued by a group of independent experts. Early estimates, and valuations of similar, smaller copper hoards, suggest a price in the region of £,.

Ella died in  at the age of just nine, after three years of seizures and  visits to hospital for asthma attacks. Last week, after years of tireless fighting, Rosamund won a new inquest for her daughter after new evidence emerged over a connection to air pollution. This inspirational former teacher from south east London now has a message for all of us. “I’m just a single mum from Lewisham fighting against all these powerful interests,” she says. “My campaigning started to get justice for Ella, but I also want to tell people how urgent this is.    “Climate change is happening now. Air pollution is killing people now. We have to do something about it this second.” Air pollution is linked to , early deaths a year in the UK. This week, data from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory revealed . million children go to school in areas where levels of toxic particles exceed the World Health Organisation’s recommended limit. Ella’s family live near one of London’s busiest roads. “Now we know the air my daughter was breathing was killing her,” Rosamund says. “I have to try to stop that happening to other children.” Since the first inquest, she has discovered the terrible truth that  out of  of the times Ella was hospitalised coincided with very high spikes in pollution in her neighbourhood. This time round, she wants air pollution as a contributory factor in her death. “If that happens, she will be the first child in the world,” Rosamund says. The Mothers’ Climate March – which takes place on International Mother’s Day – has been inspired by the global schoolchildren protests led by Greta Thunberg. “If my Ells had still been alive, she would have been more or less the same age as Greta,” Rosamund says.    “They would have had a lot in common. Ells was a bit of a tomboy and very focused like Greta. Young people are smart – they have always got it. So I’m not surprised to see leadership coming from young people.” Ella’s legacy may be to “change the law for people in London, the UK and even the world”, her mum says. Greta’s has been to lead the climate change debate into the mainstream, suffering crude attacks from trolls along the way. “As a former secondary school head of year, I do worry about Greta,” Rosamund says. “Social media is so brutal. You have to ask what would possess grown men to attack a -year-old with autism online. If she was one of my students I’d have gone straight to the police to report them for bullying.” Shamefully, Rosamund has had her own share of attacks. “The deniers often want to tell me how or why my daughter died. I say to them, ‘You know what, speak to her pathologist’,” she says. “Or they say ‘I blame the parents’ and want to know why we didn’t move house. During the period she was ill, Ella was in a coma four times and hospitalised  times – we didn’t have time to be moving house. And at that time, we didn’t know what was causing it.”    Ella was a gted child, physically, mentally and musically, with a big smile. She dreamed of being an RAF pilot and was in discussions to play football for Millwall FC despite her le-threatening asthma. Now, through her charity, the Ella Roberta Family Foundation, Rosamund is fighting for clean air for her surviving -year-old twins, Ella’s classmates and kids across the globe. “When I look at the type of people who do environmental campaigning there aren’t that many people who look and sound like me,” she admits. “I understand when people are trying to put food on the table, they often feel like they can’t take on air pollution as well. “But all the data shows people from deprived areas are the worst affected, whether it’s here or the US. They are more likely to live close to busy roads and to have old diesel cars because they can’t afford anything .” She speaks quietly, and from experience. “When a child dies, whether from kne crime or asthma, it does affect the whole school. It has the same emotional impact.” Rosamund has had strong support from London Mayor Sadiq Khan , who wrote to the Attorney General in support of Ella’s case.The Mayor recently introduced an Ultra-Low Emissions Zone in London, and suffers from adult onset asthma himself. But Rosamund says she is yet to see Environment Secretary Michael Gove, despite asking for meetings. “I have the solutions – it just seems no one in government wants to hear them,” she says. “But Michael Gove knows I want to see him, and I’m a positive person so I think he’s going to see me in the end.” Among other things, she wants to ask him for a diesel scrappage scheme, and a ban on building new schools and housing developments in highly polluted areas.“I know he’s got the money because they found £m for a no-deal Brexit ,” she says.Rosamund is Britain’s Greta Thunberg, the activist for our times. “As a teacher, I always wanted to improve the lives of young people,” she says. “I’m not able to teach since my daughter’s death – so this is what I can do for young people now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum who contracted sepsis after","story":"NewsMum who contracted sepsis after chesty cough has both legs and one hand amputatedWARNING - GRAPHIC IMAGES Mum-of-two Lydia Galbally needs prostheses after she contracted sepsis and had to have both her legs and a hand amputatedShareCommentsByLouie Smith:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThe mum-of-two beat the odds but has had to undergo multiple amputations \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who contracted sepsis after suffering a chesty cough had to have both her legs and right hand amputated.

But after her condition suddenly worsened test revealed she had contracted sepsis , pulmonary TB and pneumonia. Lydia beat the odds to survive after spending  days in a coma.    However, she suffered severe gangrene in her hands, feet and nose, requiring multiple amputations. Her husband Dan and two children, aged nine and , are now raising money for prosthetics to aid her recovery. Dan said: At one point Lydia had  dferent intravenous drips and lines going in and out of her body.    She was on a ventilator, a kidney machine and the ECMO , as well being treated by a cocktail of ious drugs and being fed with nutrients. These were all needed to keep her alive but incredibly sadly, a result of the treatment for the sepsis, was to cruelly restrict the blood flow to her hands and feet. She had to have both her legs amputated below the knee, together with the amputation of her right hand at the wrist and the fingers of her left hand, undergoing five major operations in the last seven weeks.    Lydia was fit and healthy until last summer when she struggled to shake off a long-running cough. In September she underwent an X-ray, CT scan and bronchoscopy, which revealed the more serious conditions.  The mum spent eight weeks at the Royal Papworth hospital, in Cambridge, after being admitted in a critical condition. Sepsis is a le-threatening illness which can be triggered by any type of infection.    Dan said doctors initially did not hold out much hope for her recovery but against all odds Lydia survived.  He added: I’m so thankful to say that she has survived... She spent  days in a coma on le-support close to death. Lydia has now been discharged home and began her two-month rehabilitation treatment this week.    Dan and the coupleaposs two children are now determined to get her back to her old self. Dan said: Despite the clearly devastating and traumatic events of the last seven months, it is important to me to be able to tell you that Lydia has been incredibly brave and outstandingly strong-minded throughout. She has been, and remains truly inspirational and though she doesn’t believe that about herself, she has shown what a truly remarkable person she is.     The couple are currently taking legal advice about her medical treatment. More than £, has already been raised via a Gofundme page to help pay for new prosthetics.

The elderly residents say the ft high apossoil bundapos has blighted their views of the countryside surrounding their quiet cul-de-sac. Retired couple Alan Boutell, , and his we Doreen, , are among residents who say the mound is a blot on the landscape. It was constructed in October last year by Gazeley - a developer which is in the process of constructing two huge warehouses on land behind the street. However, residents of the street in Doncaster, South Yorks, have reacted with anger after their landscape view was spoilt by the mound just metres behind their gardens.    Some homeowners even believe the mound has caused house prices to plummet on with one property being placed on the market for £, less than the average for the street. Alan, a former digger driver, doesnapost understand why the company have left the mound. He said: When it was first left, we all thought it would just be temporary. But, nearly six months later, itaposs still there. Nobody can believe it. The company could make it lower or less visible.  Alanaposs we Doreen, said she fought the original plans for the construction of the warehouses with other residents on the street. She said the council ignored the pleas of many of the elderly homeowners. Doreen said: We used to be able to see the countryside when we sat out in the garden. Now all we can see is a huge pile of muck. Bunds are among the most common techniques used in agriculture to collect surface run-off, increase water infiltration and prevent soil erosion.    Alan and Doreenaposs neighbour John Hotterwell, , has been left outraged by the horric site at the rear of his home. As John only has a very small garden, he used to enjoy sitting in his bedroom to enjoy the view of horses and countryside. Due to the huge mud mound being placed directly behind his home, he now says he canapost even see the sky. John, a retired construction worker who lives with we Brenda, , said: I used to watch the horses going past the back of the house. All I can see when I look outside is soil and pylons. During the winter, it was literally pitch black for months. We donapost have a view anymore, it is completely ruined.  Roy Sykes, Doncaster Council’s Head of Planning, said: “The embankments are designed to act as a noise and visual buffer between residents and the proposed industrial development. They have been built to the approved height but following construction we have been made aware that some residents are unhappy with their size. We are currently discussing potential alterations which address these concerns as well as ensuring the bunds remain an effective screen to the neighbouring employment use.” A spokesperson for developer Gazeley said: “We have been working with the council to ensure that the construction and bunds have as little of an impact as possible. We have been liaising with the Local Planning Authority to discuss the possibility of obtaining a consent for alternative landscaping or potential fencing to deter people from walking on the bunds. “These discussions are ongoing and we hope to find a solution for residents.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry reveals birth baby","story":"NewsPrince Harry reveals birth of baby Archie makes him feel loss of mum DianaThe Duke of Sussex said his newborn son has given him a new focus and goal in his le while speaking at The Hague launching the  Invictus GamesShareCommentsByRussell Myers:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video harry-meghan-name-baby-son-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Harry says fatherhood has made him feel the loss of his mother Princess Diana more keenly.

I am joining millions around the UK and beyond by fasting from dawn until sunset every night for a month, and documenting my experience below as I go. Fasting, or apossawmapos as itaposs known in Arabic, is one of the five pillars of Islam. By giving up food, we think about those who are less fortunate than ourselves, and may not know when their next meal will come. But itaposs not just about food, itaposs about being grateful and appreciating all the things you have. For me, it has always been a way to realign myself with my faith every year.Some days I find myself feeling more focused, mindful and at peace. I feel the benefits, I see the purpose of it and I even enjoy it, telling myself I might just fast on random days during the year to ground myself.  But other days I feel I canapost cope, my stomach grumbles, I consider giving up, I feel void of energy and Iaposve had enough. For the next month, Iaposm going to blog my experience to lt the lid on what fasting is really like - see below for my post on Day Four.  Being as honest as I can be, I will write about my highs, my lows and everything in between. Iaposll also aim to answer all those questions youaposve probably never dared ask. To start with a few: No youaposre not allowed to drink water, yes you can brush your teeth, no I donapost believe it is harmful to your healthitaposs done sensibly , no you canapost just eat something and aposnot tell anyoneapos and yes you can swallow your own saliva...  May : Challenges Iaposm facing with fasting as I reach Day FourI’m on day four of fasting and so far, I’m fine without food, and I’m fine without water. But what I am really struggling with is the lack of caffeine.Like many, I rely on a cup of tea or coffee to give me a boost in the morning to help me work, focus, and perk me up in general.I woke up on Monday, the first day of Ramadan, with a pounding headache and knewI could just have even a sip of coffee it would have been fixed. But alas, I powered through and the pounding head soon disappeared as the day went on. What I’ve also realised is how much we use food and drink for comfort.Filling our bellies is not just about sustenance. Our meals and hot drinks affect us emotionally and give our moods a boost. Without that bit of sugar, or whatever  it is you crave, we have to find inner strength to give us that push.  Something  I’ve done, which I’m not sure I should have, is calculate the number of hours I’m fasting.Using the official dawn and sunset times for London todayI will be fasting for a total of more than  hours.That leaves me with under seven hours to try and fit in three balanced meals and two pints of water while striving for the recommended eight hours sleep - an impossible task. So instead I have to weigh things up and decide what to compromise on - food, water or sleep  Generally I prioritise water as I know how important it is to be hydrated, I try and get in two meals as any more would make me feel sick in such a short space of time, and aim to sleep for six hours, but itaposs certainly a squeeze.   May : Ramadan is imminent and I feel totally unprepared Ramadan begins on Monday, and I feel totally unprepared. The truth is, thereaposs no way to get yourself ready mentally - it seems to just come around really quickly every year and you just have to get on with it. Iaposve written a checklist - or shopping list - of what I need to get beforehand. Dates come top of the list as Muslims break their fast with dates every night. Itaposs a tradition that goes back to the Prophet Mohammed, and the high levels of sugar are a great way to boost your energy having not eaten for hours. Iaposm going to hit Tesco and make sure my fridge is well stocked for the night times. Then Iaposll have a huge feast, drink lots of water and go to bed ready for the challenge to begin.  When is Ramadan  It is the ninth month in the Islamic calendar, which is determined by the lunar cycle. When it starts is based on the sighting of the new moon, which marks the beginning of the month. If the new moonis spotted, fasting begins the following day. Similarly when determining the last day of Ramadan,the new moon is sighted the holy month is complete and Eid is celebrated the following day. Local sightings of the moon can dfer, which is why there can be discrepancies between the days dferent countries start and end their fast. It moves about  days each year in the Gregorian calendar, which is based on the solar year. Ramadan can last either  or  days. This year it began on Monday May ."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed king underworld who mentored","story":"NewsLe of crime legend Billy Hill who mentored Kray twins set to become a filmEXCLUSIVE Hills le is set to come to the big screen with Once Upon a Time in London which focuses on Hill’s uneasy alliance with fellow gangland boss Jack ‘Spot’ ComerShareCommentsByAdam Luck:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBilly Hill , pictured in , had a -year career in crime \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was  and the suite at the Dorchester Hotel in London’s Park Lane had seen nothing quite like it. The King of the Underworld Billy Hill and his lover Gyp were carefully counting out on the heavily carpeted floor £, – nearly £million in today’s money. The cash had been stolen in the capital’s biggest robbery since the Second World War. With her crystal blue eyes, lustrous jet black hair and love of furs, Gyp was an unforgettable figure, and her literal partner in crime Billy, Britain’s original Gangster Number One.    Hill’s extraordinary -year career is the focus of film Once Upon a Time in London, which rescues from relative obscurity a man who mentored the Krays, and dragged British crime into the modern era. The film focuses on Hill’s uneasy alliance with fellow gangland boss Jack ‘Spot’ Comer as they assumed control of London’s burgeoning crime scene after the war before Hill usurped his partner to assume sole control of London’s protection rackets and gambling clubs. Cool, calculating, urbane, immaculately dressed and yet always armed with a kne, Hill would draw the ire of Her Majesty’s Government, cause a political scandal, become the subject of questions asked in the House of Commons, and force The Flying Squad to expand in order to meet the challenge. Micky Fawcett, an associate of the Krays and author of true crime book Krayzy Days who watched Hill manipulate and mentor the twins, said: “He was a cunning b*****d. They were all afraid of him, the real gangsters. He became a living legend and for a while controlled London. “Hill was a thief but he reinvented himself and in the s moved up into another world.”    Hill’s origins could not have been less auspicious. Born in  he was brought up by a poor Irish mother Amelia and an English father but quickly discovered his wider family lay among the criminal fraternity. By  Hill was a full time burglar landing a three-year borstal sentence. Rather than deter, it spurred him on and although much of the next two decades were spent in and out of prison, the young Hill was learning and building up a formidable criminal network. Realising burglary held too many risks, he moved onto robbery – known as coshing or blagging, of high value targets because cash was easy to dispose of and hard to trace. Later Hill expanded into smash and grab, targeting jewellers and fur shops, and so prolic were he and his criminal associates that questions were asked in the House of Commons. But his luck ran out in  and he was jailed for shop breaking, but his release from prison at the beginning of the Second World War could not have been more fortuitous, for Hill. The blackouts and black markets provided rich pickings for Hill and his gang, known as the Heavy Mob.    Stolen lorries and Post Office safes became the currency and by  Hill estimated in his autobiography that he was earning about £ a week – or £, in today’s money. Hill had little time for patriotism noting that the “privileged” consistently dodged the front line. Then in July  Hill launched what he called “the night of the long knives” when he flooded London’s streets with his men. The following morning crowned himself the boss of Britain’s underworld. In  Hill, met -year-old Gypsy Phyllis Blanche Riley who was working behind a bars in one of his clubs. The late Mad Frankie Fraser, who worked as a Hill enforcer, said: “She was a cracker, really good looking.” Hill’s son Justin, , an East London delivery driver who told his family story in the book Billy Hill, Gyp and Me, says: “My father met Gyp in  when he was still married to his first we Aggie. Gyp was also married at the time.    “She changed my father’s le when they met. They became partners in crime and advised one another.” Justin, whose birth mother committed suicide when was two years old, regards Gyp as his mother. He said: “She brought me up proper. As I grew up I would hear and read things and ask Gyp whether they were true. “She never hid the truth.” In  Hill was the mastermind behind the meticulously planned mailbag robbery in Eastcastle Street, close to Oxford Circus. Hill targeted a debt-ridden post office worker who was a client at one of his gambling clubs for inside information. Two get-away cars were used and behind the wheel of one was Gyp. Hill barely bothered to conceal his culpability but with a watertight alibi he could afford to crow as he counted his money at The Dorchester. He said: “I have reason to think Scotland Yard may know who actually carried out that job, but any evidence to prove it has gone.” Once again, questions were asked in the House. On histo London, the crime kingpin and his team executed a daring bullion raid in Holborn, London, with his crew snatching £, worth of gold from the Dutch airline KLM. Hill felt the heat, with the Met raiding his premises and in  the then Home Secretary authorized the tapping of his phone, which led in turn to a political scandal when news of this emerged in the House of Commons. The tapping would eventually see the downfall of Hill’s barrister and the crime boss saw the writing on the wall.    Hill had carefully cultivated the up and coming Kray twins, flattering them, mentoring them and manipulating them with the promise that he would be making way for their empire. Reggie Kray would later state that Hill “stands alone and there will never be another Billy Hill”. As good as his word, Hill did indeed step back, and increasingly he preferred to spend time at his home in Tangier, Morocco. He also bought himself a bolt-hole close to Marbella, Spain, which would eventually attract so many of the British criminal classes it became known as the Costa Del Crime. When they were not in Spain or Morocco, Gyp and Hill spent time in the French Riviera, where, according to Hill’s adoptive son Justin, they mixed with Diana Dors, met Picasso and Aristotle Onassis. He bought Gypsy the biggest nightclub in Tangier, which she ran from  to the mid-s, with the help of a pet chimpanzee. She eventually ed to the UK, declined all interviews and died in . Hill died in  aged  and left virtually no public trace of his career except for his autobiography. The crowning achievement for a man once called the King of Soho was that he died wealthy and of old age.

The change in weather will banish a disappointing spell which recorded the coldest early May Bank holiday on record. Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: With high pressure we expect blue skies and sunshine and thereafter the rest of May is looking largely dry with temperatures around where they should be for the time of year. Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden told Brits to look out for a change in conditions.  He said: There is the potential for an early switch to summer-like weather this year after the unsettled and cooler start to May. This is most likely from around mid-month and possibly slightly earlier across southern regions. Mostnot all of the country can look forward to several y and widespread periods of warm weather with ample wall-to-wall sunshine from mid-May onwards bringing an early taste of summer.  High pressure will stay in charge through the start of the meteorological summer and on current indications we could be looking at a flaming June with temperatures in the mid to high-Cs at least. A forecaster for The Weather Company said temperatures will rise above average for the time of year after the weekend.    They added: Wet and windy weather will continue through the remainder of this week with temperatures slightly below the seasonal average, feeling cooler in the wind for northern and western areas. Over the weekend and into next week, it will progressively turn drier with temperatures climbing closer to the seasonal average. Early next week and through the remainder of that week it will be dry and sunny for the most part with temperatures for Ireland and northern Britain tending slightly above the seasonal average.

However despite her debilitating ordeal, she says the worst part was that she wasnapost believed.She claims she was repeatedly told it was all in her head, reports Hull Live.In every country around the world patients with ME are ignored, disbelieved and stigmatised, she said. Imagine you have been gardening, doing DIY all day or hiking on holiday when you are not used to it.    Think how it feels when you lie down at the end day – how every bone in your body aches, how every muscle feels bruised, how you can’t wait to feel the bed supporting you at last. Well, that’s how we feel all day, every day without even having gotten out of bed.

More people have ME than Parkinsons and MS combined yet there is no support for us. It has been likened to HIV when patients were blamed for their condition because it was a mystery. Scientists have even called ME ‘multiple excuses’ seeing it as attention seeking, laziness and apathy. There are other causes of CFS and some with CFS are cured. None with ME ever are. Until this year I never spoke about my years of dealing with ME because I knew no-one would believe me anyway. Thankfully there are several ME groups now, all trying to raise awareness, get the disease recognised and fund research. One such group is MEAction ME effects all ages, both sexes and often very active, creative and talented people! It could happen to you or someone you love tomorrow.

Its crop yield is at least  times more productive than other vegetable oil crop. The picture shows the elephant wander through the trunks of felled old oil palm trees at Sabah Softwoods in Sabah, Borneo. The picture, taken at the end of March, comes as a new UN study outlined the damage being done to the natural world.    The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Servicesreport warns that declines in nature are accelerating as a result of human activity, which in turn threatens peopleaposs well-being. The global assessment comes in the wake of widespread protests on the streets of London and other UK cities over the twin crises of environmental damage and climate change, in which more than , people were arrested. Lorna Greenwood, spokeswoman for Extinction Rebellion which led the protests, said: The natural world is collapsing because of how we live and we will go with it unless we act now. Not only are we destroying nature but weaposre worsening our own health and making it harder for us to feed ourselves. Itaposs time to rethink how we grow food, travel and look after the countryside.  It may mean hard choices but the rewards are enormous. Within our letime we could see nature restored and our childrenaposs future secured. She said protesters had no choice but to rebel until our world is healed, but said the sht in public attitudes in the last fortnight meant it was becoming politically realistic to rethink how to produce food and look after nature. Responding to the report, Greenpeace UKaposs executive director, John Sauven, said: The worldaposs leading scientists have once again hit the emergency button over the state of our planet. Itaposs time political and corporate leaders stopped making empty promises and started acting to prevent us sliding towards another mass extinction of le on Earth. Itaposs absolutely vital that we urgently change the way we use the land and oceans to end this war against nature, he said, calling for end to forests being cut down for palm oil and soy production and the exploitation of the oceans.    He urged the UK Government to restore peatlands, plant millions of trees, provide ocean sanctuaries around the coasts and support a sht from meat and dairy to healthy, plant-based meals. Abi Bunker, director of conservation at the Woodland Trust, said it was essential to address the climate and natural environment crises together. She said natural systems on which people depended in the UK were under pressure from habitat and wildle loss, use of pesticides, pollution, overgrazing, invasive species and pests and diseases, and climate change. More native trees and expanded woodland cover were a huge part of the solution to tackle damage to the natural environment, absorb carbon emissions and help cope with the impacts of climate change, such as flooding. To make an impact, new woodland creation, using natural regeneration wherever possible, will need to happen on a faster and far greater scale than ever before and be sustained over several decades, she urged.

Dons boss Derek McInnes facing a squad rebuild this summer, he could be putting in a similar call to the Danish Superliga outfit.That Safranko is attracting attention comes as no surprise.A fans’ favourite at United, he has scored  goals in his  appearances since joining up last August.He is also going into the promotion play-offs next week in good form, having scored three goals in his last five outings.His work at United this season has earned him a recall to the Slovakian national squad for recent Euro  qualiers against Hungary and Wales.That’s increased his profile on the Continent and there is every chance of clubs there joining any chase for him.There is, though, also the possibility Aalborg could decide to have him in their squad for next term, leaving all interested parties including United disappointed.They’ve had a mediocre season and have only been averaging just over a goal a game in league matches.Tonight, meanwhile, Tangerines boss Robbie Neilson will be heading for Ayr to watch the first leg of the play-off quarter-final between the Honest Men and Inverness Caley Thistle.The pair meet again in the Highlands on Saturday and only then will United know where they’ll be heading for the first leg of their play-off semi-final a week tonight.Theleg of that one will be at Tannadice on Friday night and, should United get through, they will host the second-bottom finishers in the Premiership the following Thursday.With that potentially hectic schedule of four games in under a fortnight, the manager has given the squad a couple of days off before

He is targeting ato action in October.Dons boss Derek McInnes recently confirmed he would be open to signing Hoban when fully fit againhe became a free agent.When askedhe would consider signing for Aberdeen, he said: “It is % something I would definitely considerit was an option.“My time at Aberdeen was a lot shorter than I had hoped for but I really loved my time up there.“I got on really well with all the boys and it is probably one of the best changing rooms I have seen in my time in football.#Aberdeen are a massive club. You get to play Europa league football and they are always up there at the top end of the table.“You get to play massive games against sides like Celtic and Rangers.“There is definitely a big appeal to going back to Aberdeen.“It was really nice of Derek to say that andit was to come up it is something I would % consider.”Hoban sustained damage to his anterior cruciate ligament in the - draw with St Mirren at Pittodrie on February .It was the second serious knee injury to hit him inside two years.He was ruled out for the whole of last season having suffered a cruciate ligament injury during pre-season training with Watford in summer .This time the damage was to a dferent knee.As he battles through his rehabilitation, under a private physio separate from Watford, Hoban admits he could face a period of uncertainty over his future.On talks on his future with Watford, he said: “I haven’t yet but will probably hear from them in the next month or so I would imagine“Obviously the season is coming to an end but they have an FA Cup final to focus on at the minute.“I am sure once all that is done I will hear something.“But I haven’t heard anything regarding that as yet.“With the rehab I am not actually going into Watford now which makes it a little more dficult.“I am doing the rehab privately one to one with a physio recommended by the surgeon. Obviously there might be a few months when I am out of contract and there is that kind of uncertainty.“But that doesn’t change what I need to do which is to get fit.“I am pretty focused on just that end goal of getting back and playing at the top level.”Such is Hoban’s connection with Aberdeen he travelled up to Hampden from England during his rehab to cheer on the Dons in the Scottish Cup semi-final.He sat with the other injured Aberdeen players at Hampden.Hoban said: “The boys did great to get to a semi-final and also a finalthis season. Unfortunately it wasn’t to be and it ended up being a bit of a crazy game in the end.“It is quite a young team at Aberdeen and that experienceis something they will % learn from and take forward in their career.“I am sure a lot of them will have those chances again.“Hopefully next season they will go one better and hopefully get to the final and win some silverware.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/05/5cd44a66a7e012.37003511.jpg ","title":"aberdeen businessman sir ian wood named scotlands second richest man","story":"An Aberdeen businessman has been named Scotland’s second richest man.The Sunday Times Rich List has unveiled the names of the north-east’s wealthiest people ahead of its publication this weekend.Oil magnate Sir Ian Wood and his family remain at the top of the local list with £. billion – making him Aberdeen’s only billionaire.The former managing director of Wood plc has increased his wealth by around £ million in the last  months, which has pushed the family up from third place in the overall standings.In , Sir Ian’s JW Holdings firm raked in £.m in profits.The family were one of only two to make their fortune from oil in the Scottish top  list, alongside Highland Spring owner Mahdi al-Tajir in fth place, who also has interests in the energy sector.Aberdeen-born Tony Quinn and his we Christina, who now live in Australia and made their fortune in the pet food industry, come in at second on the north-east leaderboard with wealth of £m.Robert Watts, the compiler of the Sunday Times Rich List, said: “Many Rich Listers are this year nursing big losses due to the uncertainty over Brexit, turbulence on the stock market and the enormous change sweeping through our high streets.“But more than half of our Scottish Rich List have seen their fortunes rise over the past  months – that’s a higher proportion than other parts of the UK.”Despite only two oil tycoons cracking the top  in Scotland, seven of the nine wealthiest people in the north-east attained at least part of their wealth through the energy sector, including Steven Ferguson , Tony Quinn , Michael Freeman .

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"christmas arrives at loch fyne sea angling club","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowAfter a series of weather related cancellations, Loch Fyne Sea Angling Club finally held its Christmas and combined league outing on Saturday February .While conditions were challenging on Loch Etive, it proved to be a fun day.

This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp. During the camp the group discussed how the unit could reduce its impact on the environment and how these changes could be implemented. Plans are now afoot for a further event in May to create an installation that looks at the impact of plastic on the countryside.Most recently three of the leaders, David Smart, Anne Smart and John McCartan took the chance to abseil  feet off the Falkirk Wheel. This event had been organised by Scout Scotland and gave a chance to meet up with other participants from all over Scotland.Looking to the future the group has exciting plans for the summer. The Beavers will be attending a district fun day in May and the Cubs will be participating in a district trophy event in June.The Scouts are heading to a national Scout adventure camp in May and the Explorers are organising an adventurous activities camp in June.Scout leader David Smart said: #In late June th Argyll Scout Group is expecting to host two Norwegian Scout visitors and in July,  members of the group will be heading off for international adventures. Six young people and two leaders are travelling to Malaysia to undertake community projects in a remote northern village and two Explorers will participate in the th World Scout Jamboree in the USA.He continued: #We are sad that our Beaver leader Eli is leaving us for pastures new.

In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks. This will avoid the need for a proleration of other masts locally.ldquoThe proposed development complies with the principal policy requirements of the local development plan and is consistent with ensuring that an improved digital infrastructure is available, to ensure people and communities are better connected.While discussing the proposals, councillors were broadly in favour of granting planning permission.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing said: ldquoI have no problem with this application whatsoever. Itrsquos time the Ettrick Valley was brought into the st century.ldquoI absolutely think this is the right decision.Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford also spoke in favour of the proposals: ldquoIrsquom delighted by this.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Therersquos natural field run off, from the field to the south.ldquoMost of that seems to occur to the west of the site, but wersquore going to prevent any more run off by installing a cut off drain all the way around the site which will collect the water.ldquoThis drain will be connected to a culvert which runs under the railway to the north, and eventually runs into the Eye.ldquoThe other issue is that surface water is getting into the combined sewer that serves this area, and is causing problems down stream.ldquoSome road gullies are connected into this combined sewer and are causing surcharge of the sewer and in some cases flooding.ldquoWersquove out careful design into this, and wersquore not taking surface water to the combined sewer, wersquore taking it to the culvert under the railway.ldquoIt will be taken off at a very attenuated rate, at just two litres a second, which is a very small amount of water. The culvert could take up to  litres.Following an hour-long discussion, councillors were finally able to decide that the proposals could go ahead, providing that in depth surveys were conducted into drainage and foul water flooding.The site will then be subject to planning conditions once the scale of the problem is known.Speaking in favour of approving the planning application, Kelso and District councillor Simon Mountford said: ldquoWe have to ask ourselves: do the proposals represent a suitable development  I think yes they do.ldquoAre the proposals acceptable in terms of parking and road safety  I think yes they are.ldquoI am a little concerned about industrial traffic but I feel this could be mitigated by an industrial road.Lauderdale and Melrose councillor Tom Miers told the committee: ldquoI think for me the main concern is absolutely drainage and flooding.ldquoWe need to be absolutely certain that any new development will not exacerbate any existing problems.ldquoI think it would be useful to include a condition that we require written evidence that the development will not add to the issues.ldquoIt needs to be in black and white, that according to the evidence it will not create more problems.East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton said: ldquoThere must be some sort of attenuation to the drainage.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

Researching a piece about Dundeersquos reaction to Nicolarsquos Sturgeonrsquos announcement on a possible second independence referendum, she did her job and appealed on social media for a pro-Union voice to appear among a ldquoiety of opinions ndash including pro-independence supporters ndash to be featured in the package. What followed was a pile-on of epic and bizarre proportions, as hundreds jumped on the bandwagon and accused her of bias, told her to ldquof*** off , that she was ldquoscum, a ldquoclown of a lassie and a ldquostupid bint.Primarily, this is a very personal ndash not to mention sexist ndash attack on Ms Clford Bell. But it also represents a worrying and increasingly common assault on the act and process of journalism itself, a wilful misunderstanding of what journalists do, a knowing conflation of news and comment, a perpetuation of the warped idea that ldquogood journalism is what I agree with, and ldquobad journalism is everything .Read more: SNP declares war on cybernatsMore than anything, it reflects a worrying lack of critical thinking. Indeed, some of the responses to those who criticised the bad behaviour are as grim as the initial attack blaming the victim, whatabouteryand reeling off old complaints about BBC presenters only makes it worse. Whorsquod want to share a movement, let alone a country ndash independent or not ndash with these people Ms Clford Bellrsquos experience is a depressing sign of the times that reflects a more general willingness to trade critical thinking for the ease of conspiracy theories, righteous anger, having a , and a sense of identity and community, eventhe latter is based on nothing more than the precarious idea of a shared enemy.At the same time, the power and reach of social media also attracts those looking to monetise certain views, not to mention nefarious organisations and even foreign states whose main aim is to stir up trouble. And since the current system encourages anonymity and duplicity, it can be hard to work out who or what is even real.The so-called lsquoCybernatsrsquo exist in a relatively tiny corner of social media, of course, their vitriol matched by those shouting about other extreme world views, most notably ldquoBrit Nats, Hard Brexiteers, Trump supporters and white supremacists.Theyrsquore all equally unsavoury, flourishing by using OTT, hysterical narratives to pinpoint and frame their attacks, often choosing to personally abuse the target in the process humiliate, intimidate and crush.Since they shout so loud, the lsquoCybernatsrsquo often succeed in getting the attention they crave, which in turn exaggerates how representative their views are within the Yes movement, thus turning off more moderate supporters and potential new recruits to the cause.Depressingly, thatrsquos why I think it will be so dficult for Messrs Robertson, McDonald and Smith to change anything. The attack dogs do so knowingly, in order to deliberately provoke attention, or are so far down the unthinking zealot road as to be beyond reach. What both have in common is that the more they insult, the easier it becomes.Such abuse has nothingto do with independence per se, but the damage for the wider Yes movement will be harder to disassociate.The appeal for nuance and persuasion comes at a time when both seem out of fashion, while extreme language pulses and trends through our discourse.Those of us looking for comfort should perhaps turn back to Dickens. At the very least, A Tale of Two Cities reminds us that nothing ndash not even the worst of times - lasts forever."},{"url":null,"title":"johann-lamont-on-20-years-of-devolution-labour-went-from-56-msps-to-23","story":"Among the first crop of MSPs to be elected to the Scottish Parliament, Johann Lamont remembers the excitement and fearlessness of those early days.A teacher with young children of her own, the former Scottish Labour leader hadnt expected to become a politician, but felt a strong sense of being part of something \"really important\".She still recalls the shock, then, when that atmosphere of heady opportunity gave way \"almost immediately\" to negative headlines and relentless scrutiny.ldquoIt felt both very exciting, very challenging, that sense of uncertainty in any new job, but then combined with almost a backlash,\" she says. \"We were naive and didnrsquot really see it coming.Sitting in her office in Holyrood ndash the pound million complex that inspired so many of those early press stories ndash Ms Lamont reflects on the last two decades of devolution.The Glasgow MSP led Scottish Labour from  to , steering it through one of the most dramatic periods in recent political history.Standing down shortly after the independence referendum, she famously hit out at its London leadership for treating the Scottish party like a \"branch office\".Now she says she wont run for Holyrood again when the next elections arrive in , though she is a Glasgow South candidate for Westminster.She is brutally honest when it comes to Scottish Labours current fortunes in Holyrood.ldquoThere were  of us [in the beginning] ndash therersquos now ,\" she says. \"That tells its own story.\"Irsquove personally moved from the centre of the chamber to one side, and Irsquom now up the back on the backbenches of the third party.\"Soyou wanted a graphic description of whatrsquos happened to the Labour Party, and the challenges we face, therersquos a sense of that.\"Shes also forthright when it comes to the shortcomings of the parliament itself. It lacks \"big thinking\", she says, and has lost the untidy energy that characterised its early days.But its not just Holyrood that has lost its ambition ndash its the institutions and bodies around it.A third sector that was previously bursting with ideas and determination now fears to speak out in case its funding is stripped away by vengeful ministers.ldquoI personally think the third sector, in particular, has been very conditioned in a way that they werenrsquot then,\" Ms Lamont says.ldquoI think therersquos a lot of people, who are all really good people ndash their ambition is less.ldquoBecause they donrsquot want to fall out, so actually they ask for what they think theyrsquoll get.ldquoI think whats happening now [is] worthy of an investigation by somebody, somewhere,people are willing to speak about it.ldquoThird sector organisations are reminded where their funding comes from, and so they donrsquot really push as hard as they might have done in the past.ldquoAnd actually also, people have accepted that Government backbenchers are not going to rebel. So they donrsquot even put them under pressure.She adds: ldquoObviously the SNP are in power. It may have happened anyway.The MSP says there is an attitude among charities and other organisations of \" I go out on a limb here, and say something really dficult, there will be consequences in terms of my funding. So I will not be able to do that again.\"In the early years of Holyrood, there was always a chance the biggest party would lose out at the next election. But with the dominance of the SNP, \"you have to accommodate yourself with that realityyou rely on the funding and things like that\".The quality of political debate has also been hit. Most debates now, Ms Lamont says, are simply a proxy for something  - namely, the ongoing constitutional battle over independence.Meanwhile, there is an \"unhealthy\" dynamic that sees ministers rarely fielding questions from their own side, while the co-operative spirit Holyrood was meant to foster hasnt quite survived contact with reality.ldquoI always thought there was a slight naivety about this idea thatyou put people in a circle and say itrsquos a more [representative] parliament, theyre somehow more likely to agree with each other,\" Ms Lamont says.\"I donrsquot think so. I think itrsquos actually in some ways more tribal. But itrsquos not tribal around policy mdash itrsquos tribal around what itrsquos a proxy for.She says the balance between the executive and parliament has changed over the years, with almost half of the current SNP group holding ministerial posts.The former Scottish Labour leader advocates a more \"mature\", cross-party approach. This could see Green MSPs, who helped vote through the minority SNP Governments Budget earlier this year, drafted in as ministers.ldquoIf they stuck somebody like Andy Wightman in to do land reform, into their Cabinet, that would be quite a good trade-off against other things that the Greens might not be able to do,\" she says.But amid the disappointments, there have been plenty of good times.Ms Lamont looks back fondly on those early days, when anything seemed possible and friendships were forged \"in that sense of being under siege\".ldquoI mean, it was really good fun,\" she says. \"It was hilarious. I look back with a lot of sadness.ldquoIf yoursquore anywhere for  years, therersquos things that have happened in your own le.ldquoI lost my mother in .

Theyrsquove kind of formed their character, theyrsquove got good values, theyrsquore pushing out there and beginning to understand what they want out of le.ldquoI would think the Scottish Parliament needs to get to that point, and the sooner the better.\"Because therersquos so many really good things that it has done, and so many good things it can do, and so much resource that can be applied in a dferent way."},{"url":null,"title":"why-some-are-seeing-red-over-the-costs-of-going-green","story":"As it extols the virtues of outdoor yoga and mindfulness as ways to soothe the modern soul, the tourist body is showing how to be fully ldquoon trend with the times. When it comes to Scotland today, it seems you can have any colour of policy you want, as long as it is green.Things certainly move fast in the new, greener Scotland. A week and a half ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon used her speech at the SNP conference to declare a ldquoclimate emergency. This followed meetings with young climate change campaigners who had gone on strike from school to get across the message that adults were ruining the planet. Scotland was already a world leader in tackling climate change, said the FM, and having announced an emergency she pledged that Scotland would live up to its responsibility to tackle it.Act now or risk devastationThis week, in what was punted as a measure of her dedication, she dumped a manesto commitment to cut air passenger duty. Straight into the grey bin it went, no plans to recycle. Farewell concerns about Scotlandrsquos connectivity to the rest of the UK and the world. Ta-ta to boosting tourism and exports, and all those other benefits the party had argued would follow the tax cut.As of yesterday morning, the SNPrsquos website continued to state that ldquoUK Air Passenger Dutyis one of the most expensive taxes of its kind in the world and hampers Scotlandrsquos ability to secure new direct international routes and maintain existing ones. Indeed, the level of taxation on the tourism sector, taking account of both VAT and APD, is amongst the highest in the world. This relatively high burden of taxation restricts the potential of the sector to grow to attract many more visitors to Scotland.Greens: The positive way to fight climate changeBut forget all that. As Derek Mackay, the Finance Secretary, told the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday, cutting the tax ldquois no longer compatible with more ambitious climate targets. So yoursquoll have had your cheaper holidays and the chance to turbo charge the economy.Business is angry about the sudden U-turn on a policy that has been in place for eight years.

Others have asked why,the government is so keen to tackle climate change, it is spending pound million to keep Prestwick airport open. Glasgow Prestwick Airport.It is no use complaining, however. As Roseanna Cunningham, the Environment Secretary, pointed out,everyone is in agreement that the planet is facing a climate emergency then politicians must act in the national and international interest, ldquoand not just what suits party political purposes.How magnanimous. How fortunate, moreover, that this reinvigorated dedication to the cause comes in a parliament where support of the Greens is vital in passing the administrationrsquos budget and other measures.But again, who are we to quibble  Itrsquos an emergency.

Look at what is already happening on the roads. Like a lot of other people, I would like to cycle rather than drive. Yet when you see the antagonism between cyclists and drivers it does not seem worth the risk.From this week, in response to the number of cyclists injured, undercover police are to take to bikes to enforce the rules on overtaking. Those who drive too close and are caught face three penalty points on their licence. A reasonable enough response to such thoughtless actions.But thoughtlessness is not the sole preserve of drivers. It is not unusual to see cyclists travelling in packs that are dficult to pass, causing frustration among motorists. On my way into work there is a stretch of road that includes dedicated cycle lanes. It cost a small fortune to create them, and the disruption caused lasted for months, yet a lot of cyclists will not use them. Then there are the bikes on pavements, the cyclists who jump traffic lights and the ones, albeit a minority, who seem to see it as their duty to be aggressive.Clock is ticking nowSelfish and dangerous behaviour on the part of cyclists and drivers should not happen, and it wouldnrsquotthe system of give and take, of compromise, was working as it should. But one side feels penalised by the other. The more people feel green policies are an imposition on particular groups, rather than something that benefits us all, the more ision will occur.In such sensitive times it does not help for policymakers to so blatantly play politics with environmental matters, as has happened with the air tax cut U-turn.

The online poll is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website www.orkney.gov.ukA shortlist has been drawn up by OIC Marine Services which features prominent figures from the county’s history, plus the name of a previous pilot launch:The design and build contract for the new -metre pilot vessel was secured after a competitive tendering exercise by Astilleros Armon S.A, which has its main base in Northern Spain.The vessel will join the two pilot launches currently operated by Marine Services. The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney.

The third prequalying bidder, the international ferry operating company Förde Reederei Seetouristik GmbH  Co. KG , decided not to pursue any further interest in the competition. Transport Scotland will evaluate bids received, with a view to having a new public service contract in place by  October .#Mr Wheelhouse added: #Simultaneously, Transport Scotland will continue its engagement with the European Commission to seek an early resolution to Pentland Ferries’ outstanding State aid complaint about the subsidies payable under the next public services contract.#Further information about Transport Scotland’s engagement with the Commission and any implications for the tender procedure will be announced in due course.#Responding to confirmation by the Scottish Government that the tendering of the Northern Isles ferry contract will proceed as set out in the original documentation, Orkney’s MSP Liam McArthur said: “This is welcome confirmation by the Minister that there should be no slippage in the timing for tendering the next Northern Isles ferry contract. However, the timeframe is tight and will be challenging for both bidders.“We need to see real improvements delivered through the next contract, including an increase in freight capacity and restoration of sailings on the Pentland Firth route.“Unfortunately, the Minister is unable to shed any light on when passengers on the Northern Isles routes can expect to benefit from RET. Almost a year on from the date for implementing RET, those using these leline services are still being forced to pay over the odds.

Taking inspiration from Orkney’s Norse roots, Highland Park embarked on an adventure to open the new shop, he explained.Patricia Retson, said: “It was an honour and a pleasure to open the new Highland Park store. I hope to see many more visitors discover Orkney and Highland Park’s exciting history.”Mr Craig joined Ms Retson to mark the occasion with a reading of a traditional Viking poem.Mr Craig, added: “We’re excited to open the doors to our new shop and share even more of our world with our visitors. It felt fitting, on a day believed to be about embarking on new adventures for our Nordic ancestors, that we’ve embarked on ours.”“We could think of no better ambassador to open our new store than Patricia. She retired from her role as Senior VP and Education Host at the Highland Park Distillery in April, having helped us create a multi award-winning visitor experience. Patricia’s commitment to the industry and passion for our rich history makes her a true modern day Viking Soul.”Orkney-based photographer and digital influencer Kendra Towns is the first to feature her collection of images inspired by the light on the islands.Seven new members of staff have been employed, with an additional four members joining the team during the summer season.Further details in the Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic. Action short of a strike is also ongoing.The union representing the ATCs, Prospect, has said the announcement of the new day comes following the breakdown of talks held last week.Prospect had previously called off a day’s strike on April  to allow the company to develop new proposals. As no new offer has been made and with no further talks scheduled the union has said an offer is not likely to be tabled.Notably, the new strike date is also the first day of the Orkney Folk Festival, which welcomes acts and visitors to the county from all over the world.David Avery, Prospect negotiations officer, said: “Members have run out of patience with HIAL. Talks have been ongoing for more than a year to seek to resolve this dispute but to no avail. Prospect agreed to withdraw our strike action in April to allow further talks to take place and members trusted that HIAL would use that time to bring forward proposals to resolve the dispute — HIAL have abused that trust.“Members do not want to take industrial action but have been left with no choice.

It’s a large stone cross marking Flora MacDonald’s grave, known, of course, for assisting the escape of Bonnie Prince Charlie, although comparably little is known for certain about her own le, and her motivations have been interpreted in dfering ways.The stone, it is said paid for by public donations, looms huge and solidly, staking its claim to a bit of horizon as waves roll in the background. Far from most tourist hot spots, it is situated in Kilmuir Cemetery near the Trotternish Peninsula. It’s remote enough for visitors to starkly appreciate the wildness of Scottish nature at its most bold, and our inidual smallness next to battering wind, roaring sea, and historical legend assaulting the senses all at once.But it feels poignant not only for the setting or the story, but because it is a monument to a woman. Many monuments have prestige quite often they’ve been designed to demonstrate the wealth of traders and patrons. Not all have the same power to inspire, or come anywhere near it.The ability to evoke shivers comes from this comparative rarity it feels not only a monument to MacDonald but a reminder that, often as quietly and remotely as the setting of this marker, the women of Scotland have also shaped history.: Alternative map of Scotland renames famous landmarks after notable womenAuthor Sara Sheridan’s new book, Where are the Women  reimagines a Scotland where plentul monuments, streets and natural wonders take the names of women. Look up a part of Scotland and it will tell you of local women who achieved remarkable things in art, science, social movements and professional fields, those who played a role in history in other ways, or who were persecuted as witches. Almost none of them have a monument in their honour Sheridan has imagined strolling dedicated walkways, observing plaques, and looking upon celebratory fountains.“Follow the bronze arrows to see women who influenced the area and indeed the world.” If we followed the author’s directions, we could come across, for example, a walkway in Glasgow Green culminating in Maggie Moffat, one of the earliest Scottish Suffragettes to be incarcerated, or a window in Dundee’s St Paul’s Cathedral depicting Margaret Blackwood, founder of Disability Income Group Scotland. Women achieving would be visible everywhere, built into the world around us. Isn’t that a powerful thought It’s a great bit of research, spanning centuries of poor archiving and relegation to footnotes and asides. I’ll consult it whenever I travel around the country, to note who came before and what they did, imprinting their lives onto spaces that have kept no visible trace of them. It’s moving to consider how it would feel were Sheridan’s imaginary monuments real, and modern citizens habitually moved among not only physical reminders of historic acts but the very idea itself that excellence takes the form of women.: Scotland’s forgotten women deserve a place in history – Brian FergusonStatues are a monument to genuine achievement in many cases and great inventions have come in eras women were socially dissuaded or literally barred from pursuing professions. At other times, men considered great have stood on others’ shoulders. Wealthy merchants profiting from the slave trade loom large in landmark buildings. Few poor men – or women – have statues dedicated to them, unless you consider clusters of unnamed soldiers representing war dead. The average person probably couldn’t tell you the names, far less the stories, of very many statues dotted around their town. For most of us they are sleeping sculptural giants we walk right past. I haven’t always felt that campaigns to build new statues are the best focus of feminist energy, but replicating the image of men across our grandest squares and parks has contributed to our cultural ideas about who is taken seriously. We have placed our collective esteem in the image of man, dedicated totems, and rewarded with the enduring honour of names strewn across our maps. One might think, from walking around, that no women live here, far less have achieved anything.In the notes, Sheridan describes her research process, coming across book after book repeating the same stories of men. There are hidden accomplishments in every city and town we walk through. Efforts like Sheridan’s help draw Scotland’s women out of historical invisibility.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"why deposit return scheme for cans and bottles should be win win leader comment","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The decision to introduce a deposit- scheme for aluminium and steel cans and plastic and glass bottles is welcome and long overdue.The decision to introduce a deposit- scheme for aluminium and steel cans and plastic and glass bottles is welcome and long overdue.It has always been a scandal that we have thrown away vast quantities of a valuable material like aluminium in particular. And it will be an even greater scandalwe fail to take such steps to reduce the amount of waste plastic getting into the natural world, given we have belatedly realised just how much damage it is causing.While Scotland is set to become the first part of the UK to introduce the scheme, similar ones have been operating around the world for some time. And indeed many people will remember the days when there was a deposit on glass bottles in the UK. So there is no reason why we cannot make deposits work now and a number of reasons why we should do so.: Green groups and businesses clash over Scottish bottle depositschemeAnnouncing the Scottish Government’s intention to put legislation before MSPs, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham rightly cited the “global climate emergency” as one reason.But waste in any form is an inefficiency and there are economic benefits to be made from recycling valuable and useful materials. It has even been suggested recently that rubbish dumps could be mined for some of the materials they contain, so wasteful have we been.There is a general acceptance by the public of the need to recycle and a financial incentive – coupled with better facilities – will make a dference. It really should be a ‘win-win’ for all concerned and the sooner it is introduced, the better.: Scotland’s deposit- system: how it will workHowever, the one potential problem is the requirement for retailers todeposits to shoppers and deal with the used cans and bottles. The Scottish Retail Consortium warned the inclusion of glass in the scheme would be “an enormous burden”, particularly for small shops. High street retailers have been having a tough time of late and should not be made to pay a price for this scheme. Indeed it could be an opportunity to help them. After all,they are providing a service, could they not be given some form of payment for that  Reverse vending machines are used effectively in places like Germany and could simply the process considerably.Huge structural changes to our economy are underway as part of what is being called a new industrial revolution.

The decision to ‘democratise the Games’ was taken on Sunday at the SHGA half-yearly meeting in Braemar following a discussion with Event Scotland which can provide up to  per cent of funding.SHGA has now asked its members to run athletic events on either a handicap basis or to have separate events for men and women. It is also creating a number of new leagues for women, so that at the end of the season athletes competing regularly will get rewarded with cash prizes and trophies, the same as men.Launching the new policy, Ian Grieve, SHGA secretary, said: “Talking to people and looking at what was in the press, we found that there wasn’t a good awareness of what Highland games can offer female athletes, and there was more we can do to help that situation.“We get lots of male and only some female competitors, but would like to see a lot more.”Mr Grieve said his organisation had contacted over  athletic clubs across Scotland to make athletes aware of the changes, as well as printing and distributing , calendars of events and have listed details on their website.Mr Grieve added: “The aim of all this is to raise the number of female athletes at the Highland games,they come along they will be made very welcome.”Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour MSP for the Highlands and Islands, who campaigned for changes to make the Games more erse and inclusive, said: “I am very pleased to hear this news from the SHGA. “Obviously it is disappointing that it took this long for them to get to this point, but the SHGA have now seen sense to join the rest of us in the st century and allow women to compete on a level playing field at Highland Games events.“With growing levels of inactivity and obesity in the country, any chance to encourage participation in sports should be promoted, as well as the huge boost Highland Games give to the economy of many of our remote and rural areas. “To exclude women would be just another hurdle that women in sport have to face.“The Highland Games are something that draws in many tourists from around the world and I am glad that this year we will have a positive message about women in sport.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc lacked in depth knowledge during independence referendum claims former staffer","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A journalist who worked at the BBC has claimed that the corporation had an inherent #lack of sympathy# for Scottish independence and a #lack of in-depth knowledge# about the country during the  referendum.

The BBC’s role in the build up to the vote was often controversial, with hundreds of independence activists protesting outside the Scottish headquarters of the corporation amid accusations of bias. : Top SNP figures make formal complaint to BBC over coverageIn the report, first reported by the National,Burnett wrote: “In terms of public service broadcasting, the BBC faces its most critical audiences in Scotland, where levels of dissatisfaction with the public broadcaster are higher than where in the UK.“This dissatisfaction with the BBC increased during the independence campaign, as the broadcaster was perceived by independence supporters to be failing in its duty to be impartial.“I was still working at a senior level in BBC News in London at the time and, although I never saw deliberate bias, a lack of in-depth knowledge about Scotland and a lack of sympathy for Scottish independence among many BBC staff were clear and mistakes in coverage were made.”: Sturgeon defends BBC journalist from online abuseBurnett told the newspaper the BBC had made a mistake in sending correspondents based in London to cover the referendum campaign in Scotland.The SNP has stepped up criticism of the BBC in recent months, arguing that data shows they are underrepresented on the corporation’s flagship political  shows, such as Question Time. Deputy leader Keith Brown told the National: “These comments by Alistair Burnett follow on from what Allan Little said about the BBC’s reporting of the  referendum and are true of the BBC’s ongoing problem with covering Scotland properly.“Twenty years on from the opening of the Scottish Parliament,  years on from the King Report and yet still the BBC network regularly falls short when it comes to reporting not just from Scotland but across the nations and regions.”The BBC defend their approach to Scotland, pointing to the recent investment in a new BBC Scotland channel.For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove unveils plans to take control of holyrood cash","story":"Radical plans to hold back tens of millions of pounds from Holyrood and allow UK ministers instead to spend the cash directly north of the Border have been set out by environment secretary Michael Gove.The Scots-born MP is among the front-runners to replace Theresa May when she stands down.He insists his plan for Westminster to be allowed to spend Treasury funding in traditionally devolved areas would strengthen the Union.It could see Westminster funding projects in areas such as education and farming.The plan would also tackle unrest at Westminster over the Scottish Government’s claim that it alone “speaks for Scotland”.“There’s a rule that we’re currently bound by, a Treasury rule which means that the UK Government can’t spend money in areas that are devolved,” Mr Gove told a fringe event at the Tory conference yesterday.“So that means when it comes to promoting culture or supporting agriculture and fisheries, the money has to go through the Scottish Government.“I think that once we’ve given the Scottish Government their fair share, the UK Government should be able to spend additional money on the basis of need for projects that will strengthen the Union.” Mr Gove said every government department thinks of itself as a UK department.Speaking during a question-and-answer session with Stirling MP Stephen Kerr, Mr Gove also hinted UK ministers could start spending in devolved areas.“The department of education deals primarily with schools in England, but actually the strength of our knowledge base across the United Kingdom matters. “There are English students in Scottish Universities and there are Scottish academics in English Universities- we need to make sure that the money that we spend and the initiatives that we carry out here are badged as UK Government.“The Scottish Government is very good at using money that it gets form Westminster to claim it is delivering them - actually it is the UK Government that is providing this and leading the way on budgets.”He hinted that more Scottish MPs would be handed ministerial roleshe replaces Theresa May“We shouldmake sure the Westminster government is seen as representative of every part of the United Kingdom and we’re prepared to energetically say to the SNP ‘You don’t speak for Scotland.’”“The whole idea that you say you are the Scottish Government and therefore you are the only legitimate voice that speaks for Scotland is wrong.“Of course we respect the devolution settlement and we respect their capacity to make policy as long they have a majority.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing. Otherwise it will be a drop in the Minch."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/barra-airport-1.jpg","title":"new flight bank to give barra community more","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineCreating a bank of  flights between Barra and Glasgow which can be used by the community at busy times of the year has been welcomed by the chairman of Castlebay Community Council.Michael Galbraith said the announcement, made last in late April by Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, was all about giving locals #more control# over the number of flights rather than having them dictated by Loganair.#If there is a wedding or an event like Barrathon then we could well need the extra flights and we can pass that request on to Loganair,# he added. #First of all it will go through the chairs of Castlebay and Northbay community councils and we will disseminate that request to the other members.

If anyone wants to come along, they are very welcome.“We raise any housing issues with Newington Housing Association and have a place on the Girdwood community forum.“We also set up a neighbourhood watch scheme which has become quite important to ensure the local community is a safer place for all.“We also run a number of events throughout the year including a family fun day to raise money for the children’s cancer unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital.”More recently, TDK Community Group have set up a food bank to provide a vital leline for the local community.The food bank operates from a Portakabin at the back of the Duncairn Centre for Culture and Arts every Monday and Wednesday from am to pm.The service is entirely run by volunteers from the TDK area with help from Rev Karen Sethuraman from Soul Space, who are also based in the Duncairn Centre.Rosemary is hoping the food bank will provide much-needed support to those in need in the local community.“The Duncairn kindly provided us with a portacabin and together with volunteers we done up and painted.“We felt there was a great need in the local community for a food bank, particularly with so many people getting disqualied for benefits and universal credit.“We found many people were running low on money each month. The price of food is getting more expensive, so the food bank is a vital resource for some.“The food bank is entirely volunteer-led and without them we could not provide the service.“The support from the local community has been absolutely fabulous. If anyone would like to donate items, please call in and help.”Rev Karen Sethuraman added, “We are a Celtic community and we want to help the community in every way we can.“We want to empower people so the food bank came about after contact with TDK Community Group.“We can support people who come in to use the food bank from food needs or pastoral care needs.”To find out more about TDK Community Group and to get involved, check out the group’s Facebook page"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"lace up for daithi on divis mountain this sunday","story":"THE call has gone out to runners and walkers of all ages and abilities to lace up for the Black Mountain k k in aid of West Belfast’s DonateDáithí organ donation campaign.As part of Feile na gCloigíní Gorma, those taking part are asked to meet at am at Divis Mountain carpark where the event will set off, taking in the Trigonometry Point, Ridge Trail and Hatchet Field before finishing at Caulfields bar.A familiar face to many, little Dáithí and his parents Seph and Máirtín will be cheering all those taking part on come Sunday morning.“Last year the run was promoting the services and help offered from a mental health charity and this year we are delighted that as part of Féile na gCloigíní Gorma and Cumann Spoirt an Phobail they have chosen DonateDáithí and organ donation,” explained Máirtín.“We are so happy to hear and to see that the run will be dedicated to Dáithí in this way,” he said.“What we have found in the last few weeks is that there won’t be a Dáithí in every area, there are about  families in the whole of Ireland and the UK who are going through what we are so it’s quite unique.

That means that  per cent of the most affordable homes are no longer available in West Belfast.”Cllr Corr continued: “The reality for us and for many many people in West Belfast who are looking for a home is the massive dference in rents between the Housing Executive houses and housing association houses,” he said.Cllr Corr said he has had numerous tenants seeking advice over their current housing association rents and that the monetary dference between that and a Housing Executive tenancy agreement could be between £ and £ per week.“Rents are decided by a housing association board, whose homes are part-funded by the Department for Communitiesbut who also need to repay loans taken out for house construction, while the Housing Executive is a totally dferent set up.“What you are finding is that housing associations are pricing out working families, especially people on low paid income who cannot afford their rents.“People are stuck. In extreme cases people have had to give up their tenancies and go back to live with their parents in what is now being referred to as the ‘boomerang generation’.“We need a radical overhaul, to increase massively the amount of affordable housing, and we need to have housing-led regeneration for many disadvantaged areas.“People who are working are forced into private rental as they can’t get a mortgage. If you can’t get a mortgage in West Belfast you are forced to look to Glenavy, Crumlin or Lisburn. People are having to leave their family support network, which in turn puts more pressure on those trying to access childcare and schools.

We now have cross party support in declaring a climate and bioersity emergency. Action now needed.”Fianna Fail’s climate action spokesman Timmy Dooley, who moved the amendment, said: “Unless we cut emissions signicantly by , the consequences will be dire.“Bioersity loss is an existential threat that is fundamentally linked to the climate crisis and Ireland’s response is similarly lacking,” he added.He maintained thatthe Government implemented the recommendations made in the committee’s report it would allow the country to get back on track and “bring an end to our laggardly response to climate change”.Sinn Fein’s Brian Stanley also called for a climate emergency to be declared.He said: “Climate action should not be viewed as a burden. We should see it as an opportunity to create a stronger, more sustainable economy for everyone. To do that, however, we have no option but to radically transform our society and economy.”Green Party deputy leader Catherine Martin said young people realised that they will be the ones most affected by the “short-sightedness” of Government today.“It is also essential that in declaring a climate emergency we commit to concrete, real and identiable action rather than just uniting around vague concepts,” she told the Dail.“There is little value in all declaring a climate emergency without committing to doing anything about it.”Climate change campaigner Greta Thunberg, , who has led a movement of young people across Europe calling on leaders to take action, welcomed the declaration.Great news from Ireland!!

Lyft’s shares closed Thursday % below its IPO price of  dollars .

And, she also hit out at both Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill.Speaking to Channel ’s Alex Thomson Sara Canning said: “It’s been three weeks. I’ve not come to terms with it. I still expect to hear from her every morning. I expect to wake up beside her, and I don’t. You know …“The phone was out she was clicking away, she was texting, she was ringing. She’d gone into reporter mode.“We were only there in total eight minutes. That’s what the police have told us, from the minute we arrived, to the minute it happened, it’s eight minutes.“Well, initially, I… Lyra was clumsy, and I thought she’d tripped over her own feet… and I looked down, and I knew straight away that she hadn’t tripped. And then I noticed that she had a head wound and I put my hand to it and I started screaming for help.”Asked what message she had for those behind the murder Sara added: “It was so indiscriminate.“There was no regard for human le. Why are we protecting that  Andit is your child, I would be ashamed to have a child that had done that. I’d be ashamed.“They took away an amazing person. I’ve lost the person I was supposed to spend the rest of my le with. I was supposed to get engaged today in Central Park. We’d planned the rest of our lives together and in one split second some idiot with a gun took that away.“And then the mealy-mouthed apologies and back-tracking and absolutely pathetic statements that were issued by Saoradh the New IRA.“You can’t apologise for killing someone. You can’t call it an accidental shooting. You fire a gun at a crowd, that’s not an accidental shooting. You’re aiming to shoot someone. I mean, it’s ridiculous. They’re not defending anyone. They’re literally a scourge on their communities. They’re a scourge. They are a scourge.“What I would say is, and this might be heavy-handed, and people might speak out against it or whatever.

They literally take young people who are disenfranchised at the best of times, who are living in poverty, who don’t see a future for themselves in Northern Ireland because there is literally very little here for them. And they tell them that the way forward is a gun in their hand. The way forward is never a gun in your hand.”Sara Canning also revealed what she told politicians who attended Lyra’s funeral in St Anne’s Cathedral in Belfast by saying: “At that stage I had looked at who was in the room and I kind of saw red a little bit. So when I was speaking to Leo Varadkar, and I said you need to facilitate these people sitting down at a table.“And so I’m putting my trust in you – you’re a world leader, and you have a presence here. You need to use it for good.“So when I turned from Leo Varadkar, it was Karen Bradley, Secretary of State. Karen Bradley offered her condolences and I accepted them graciously. And I wasn’t rude. But I did tell her that she was doing a pretty terrible job as the Secretary of State. Her lack of knowledge around Northern Ireland was appalling. She needed to go and educate herself. How on earth she had taken a job where she had no knowledge of the area.“She was very gracious I have to say. She nodded and she agreed with me that she had said things that were completely misguided and that she’s gone and educated herself.“As a Derry woman, I had to say to her, to offer your condolences on Lyra when you have turned around and said that soldiers who indiscriminately opened fire in the Bogside on Bloody Sunday were doing their job in a dignied manner. I said they are no dferent to the thug that opened fire in Creggan on Holy Thursday and shot Lyra.”The young Derry woman also spoke to Theresa May at the funeral and recalled what she said to the Prime Minister: “So I basically told her that she was massively derelict in her duties to Northern Ireland and successive governments have [been]. It’s not just been the Tory government. To tell us that issues like gay marriage and abortion rights are a devolved matter is completely out of order. We’re not a devolved state anymore. We’re completely unsuccessful. It has been shown that we can’t work together –so the British government has to be our government. And they have to be our voice and they have to do better. So, that was basically the message that I left with the Prime Minister.”The words of Fr Martin McGill inside St Anne’s Cathedral reverberated around the world when he rebuked politicians in Northern Ireland for failing to talk to each other in order to revive Stormont.“I was the first on my feet. I think. I’m pretty certain I was the first on my feet. And when I applauded, I stood up and I turned my entire body, and I looked to the seats to my right. And I looked at the politicians sitting there.“What I want is, the leaders of the parties, they want broadly the same things. There are red lines and I think we need to look beyond red lines at the minute. Same sex marriage and an Irish language act are important. They are important don’t get me wrong but what’s more important is having a working government who are doing what’s right for the people of Northern Ireland. Because we are, we’ve been left adrt. There’s people missing out on operations and there’s schools missing out on funding. There’s head teachers having to go out and buy toilet roll for their primary schools, because they don’t have the funds to do that,” Sara Canning said.Finally, Sara revealed Lyra’s plans to propose marriage to her and said: ““She had planned a really elaborate proposal at a lake house, on the lake in Central Park. Which one of her best friends Ky has helped her plan.“They had a pdf file and everything. They’d gone, [into] really minute detail. It was incredibly romantic, and she was such a thoughtful person.“She put her heart and soul into everything for everybody. She was always making sure that people were okay and wanted to make everything as perfect as she could. She was really good a planning. She wasn’t great at keeping things a secret. But she was great at planning.”"},{"url":null,"title":"two car collision causing lengthy tailbacks buncrana","story":"There a y tailbacks on the Buncrana Road in Derry due to a two-car collision.The

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

Tickets are pound each and will be available at agricultural shows, including Balmoral Show which begins today.Kerry Angus, of the NI Kerry Hill Sheep Society, thanked all the local businesses who donated prizes for the raffle and said Mr Smythrsquos family and the society were overwhelmed by their generosity.Kerry said: ldquoPatrick was born in Leitrim and went to Legananny Primary School before going to St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, where he formed friendships that would last a letime.ldquoPatrick joined the emerging Leitrim Fontenoys Marching Band and toured the country with his best mate Martin OrsquoHare as a drummer in the early rsquos and it was around this time that he met his we, Bridie.ldquoThey finally married in May  and for the first year Patrick put his talents to work in building their family home on the site of the old Leitrim Post Office formerly owned by his grandfather.ldquoBy  they had three daughters Niamh, Aoe and Kyla.

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

Down coastline.A BCM Board member is to keep schtum for a full  hours to raise funds for Copelands, the organisation’s flagship project on the Co. Down coastline.Pictured launching the sponsored silence at the Grand Central Hotel are Deputy General Manager Deborah Galloway, Peter Weil and BCM Chief Executive Nicky Conway.Notorious chatterbox Peter Weil from Helen’s Bay has been on the Board of BCMsince January and has been inspired by the fantastic work carried out by the ious projects across Northern Ireland. So much so, he has vowed to say nothing for a full -hour period.Peter said “I am slightly nervous as those who know me will attest to the fact that I barely stay quiet for five minutes, never mind a full  hours! I am hoping my friends and family, former teachers and colleagues will rally behind my effort, otherwise I am not sure how I will manage!”All funds raised will support the build and fit out of Copelands, the major investment by BCM to provide practice-leading residential, nursing and dementia care for up to  residents at its unrivalled location nestled between the Irish Sea and the rolling Co. Down countryside.BCM Chief Executive, Nicky Conway, said “We think this is a brilliant idea from a member of our Board. Former broadcaster Peter, who has also been a marketeer, lecturer, politico and communications professional, certainly knows how to talk – it’s the getting him to stop that is the issue!“Hopefully, those who know him and have experienced his innate gt of the gab will dig deep to support his efforts and the Copelands project as the build continues apace.”Peter’s  hour sponsored silence will begin at am on Friday, th May to coincide with Dementia Awareness Week, and take place in the controlled environment of a room at the Linen Quarter’s landmark Grand Central Hotel, which is kindly being sponsored by The Hastings Group.Deborah Galloway, Deputy General Manager at the Grand Central Hotel, said “The Hastings Group is delighted to be partnering with BCM for this fun and worthwhile endeavour. Having met Peter, we can appreciate his enthusiasm and dedication to the cause, and why BCM is getting behind it so fervently!“As a fellow Linen Quarter resident, we are especially delighted to be supporting BCM during its th year. Having been a pivotal presence for the local community for generations, we hope to emulate its successes with the Grand Central Hotel continuing to prove a landmark for residents and visitors to this historic part of the city centre for years to come.”BCM is celebrating its th anniversary in  with a series of fundraising efforts and initiatives to continue the le changing – and often lesaving – work of its ious projects across communities throughout Northern Ireland.No decision on Lurgan campus yet, say Education AuthorityLarne and Whitehead eye hospitality idend from The th Open Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingWoman and dog hit by car on NI roadN.I. local elections -

That anger and stoking of ision is dangerous and irresponsible.At that same rally we saw a leader of the far right who is a convicted violent racist criminal being applauded on stage.That should not make any us proud regardless of how we voted.The biggest threat to the union of the UK comes from a No Deal.It would not only destabilise politics in Northern Ireland but it would almost certainly guarantee another Scottish independence referendum.More turmoil that would not turn back the tide of austerity or add a single extra penny into our schools, the NHS or any other public service that we rely upon.I do not believe a ided UK Parliament can make a choice for the next generation of our ided countries.I was proud to sponsor two coaches and march alongside more than a million members of the public, including many people from Cardf South and Penarth calling for a Peoplersquos Vote.We need to go back to the people with a choice between a Brexit deal that Parliament can agree and our current deal within the EU.There is no simple choice to the isions that we face but I would as ever be interested to hear views from my constituents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

That anger and stoking of ision is dangerous and irresponsible.At that same rally we saw a leader of the far right who is a convicted violent racist criminal being applauded on stage.That should not make any us proud regardless of how we voted.The biggest threat to the union of the UK comes from a No Deal.It would not only destabilise politics in Northern Ireland but it would almost certainly guarantee another Scottish independence referendum.More turmoil that would not turn back the tide of austerity or add a single extra penny into our schools, the NHS or any other public service that we rely upon.I do not believe a ided UK Parliament can make a choice for the next generation of our ided countries.I was proud to sponsor two coaches and march alongside more than a million members of the public, including many people from Cardf South and Penarth calling for a Peoplersquos Vote.We need to go back to the people with a choice between a Brexit deal that Parliament can agree and our current deal within the EU.There is no simple choice to the isions that we face but I would as ever be interested to hear views from my constituents. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The reading of Markrsquos gospel was by David Cocks.At Nica the hymn lsquoHere is love, vast as the oceanrsquo was sung.The next reading was given by Ciara McAlpine. Finally at Tesco the hymn lsquoWhen I survey the wondrous crossrsquo was sung, with Sarah Long reading.Matt Lewis of Bethesda commissioned the new cross and led the short service at Bethesda.Many thanks go to Councillor John Fanshaw for the loan of the excellent PA system.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business GMcG is already a well-established and leading independent accountancy and advisory business, and the growing firm tells Ulster Business about planning for a brighter future, carrying out major investment and developing the next generation “Our success is about people, building and growing relationships, innovation and developing the next generation. We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
