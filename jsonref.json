It\u0027s fairly rare that we do get them in the day time, because they\u0027re usually seen prior to getting into town.’         The adolescent creature was spotted by shocked Churchill, Manitoba by resident Danielle Daley, who looked up out the window from her desk on October 9 to see the white bear giving two conservation officers the run around         Daley watched on in disbelief as the officers gave the bear chase, before they were eventually able to successfully drug the 200 pounder and capturing it after 15 minutes. The bear has been taken to a holding facility, in accordance with protocol, and will eventually be relocated 40 kilometres north of Churchill via helicopterHe added that he and the other officer had difficulty cornering the bear because, though the diamond is fenced off, it has a number of gateways around the perimeter that the bear could escape through.The rare encounter also attracted a large crowd who came out to watch the bear, forcing officers to make quick decisions in the interest of public safety.‘In a situation like this, where there are people around, it can be dangerous,’ Windsor said. ‘You don\u0027t want to push the bear to where there\u0027s people, so the decision was made to dart the bear. That would be the safest thing to do.’Bears in Churchill are waiting for the summer ice to come in on Hudson\u0027s Bay to hunt for seal, and the town lies between the bears\u0027 summer dens and the bay.‘Our top priority is the safety of people, that\u0027s the first priority that we have with the polar bear alert program. The second priority is the safety of the bear. That ranks right up there also,’ Windsor clarified."},{"url":null,"title":"No heirs graces Heres Royals touch people","story":"Fall for florals in a MICHAEL Michael Kors dress like the DuchessNow sold out!

Part shock, part jubilation, her expression spoke volumes of her remarkable journey to success. Holmes’ career had been blighted by injuries, anaemia, asthma and depression, and her undeniable talent was frequently stymied on the greatest stage of all: at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta she competed with a stress fracture in her shin, narrowly finishing fourth in the 800m at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney she overcame a calf tear to win bronze. By 2004, aged 34 and injury-free for the first time, she targeted gold in the 800m and 1,500m. In both finals she waited until the home straight before powering to the front of the field, becoming only the third woman in history to do the middle-distance double. “I can’t believe it!” she yelled repeatedly after her 800m triumph.

John Brunton guides you to the region’s lesser-known gemsExperience urban BordeauxBordeaux has enthusiastically embraced urban regeneration, converting abandoned spaces into art, music and community projects. Kick off with the Darwin Ecosysteme, a sprawling army barracks that now houses an urban farm, artisanal brewery, skatepark, and venues for live music. Stroll along the Garonne river, marvelling at magnificent 18th-century palaces “mirrored” in the world’s largest reflecting pool, Miroir d’Eau. And from summer 2020, experience the Bassins de Lumières, exploring the immense water bunkers of an old Nazi submarine base, immersed in giant projections of Gustav Klimt’s art.Sample the local marketsThe Marché des Capucins, established in 1749, is the belly of Bordeaux and boasts locally produced caviar, charcuterie and around a hundred different cheeses. Head to Chez Jean-Mi, packed with locals jostling for a glass, while tourists vie for a table to feast on plump local oysters. Down the street, enter the vibrant square of Basilique Saint Michel, which transforms, four days a week, into a giant flea market.Tantalise your taste budsStay at concept hotel, Eklo, an inexpensive and classy take on the youth hostel, with wooden-clad bunks, private rooms, and a funky bar to have an evening apéro. Wine lovers and kids alike can embark on a sensory and interactive adventure to discover the cultures and civilisations of wine at the Cité du Vin, the swirling glass and metal wine museum stealing the Bordeaux skyline. The tour ends on the rooftop, where you can admire panoramic views of Bordeaux while sipping a glass of wine (or grape juice, if you prefer). Across from the Cité du Vin is new food market, Les Halles de Bacalan, whose vast brasserie serves a cuisine dubbed “démocrachic”: simple terroir recipes made from outstanding organic produce at affordable prices.Hang out with the localsThe cobbled backstreets of Bordeaux are a food lover’s paradise. Don’t miss Le Petit Commerce, where you can indulge in freshly caught grilled sea bream with a bottle of white Bordeaux. Prefer a wine bar crawl?

He died in Zurich in January 1941 at the age of 58, after undergoing surgery on a perforated ulcer. He is buried in Fluntern cemetery in Zurich, alongside his wife Nora, who died 10 years later. In 1966, they were moved from an ordinary grave to a more prominent one, where their son Giorgio was later buried with them in 1976.When Joyce died, Ireland’s secretary of external affairs sent the order: “Please wire details about Joyce’s death. If possible find out if he died a Catholic.” Barnacle later requested that his remains be repatriated but the minister for external affairs refused.The new motion to repatriate the remains was brought forward on Monday by Dublin councillors Dermot Lacey and Paddy McCartan, who both argued that it was Joyce and Barnacle’s final wish. If it goes ahead, the plan would coincide with the centenary of Ulysses in 2022. The novel was once effectively banned in Ireland, as the Irish government used a customs loophole to prevent it from entering the country.Speaking on Newstalk radio, McCartan said he had felt it was appropriate to revisit the idea ahead of the the Ulysses anniversary and said they would call on the council to appeal to the Department for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. He said the decision would ultimately fall with the Irish government and the Department of Foreign Affairs.“There may be people who are not fans of this and want to let sleeping dogs lie. Joyce is a controversial figure, there are no doubts about that,” McCartan said. “Exile was a key element in his writing but for it to follow him into eternity? I don’t think that was part of the plan.”There have been previous attempts to convince Irish authorities to repatriate Joyce’s remains, such as in 1948, after WB Yeats’s remains were successfully returned to Sligo from France, although more recently doubts have been raised that the bones sent were all Yeat’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a79dc2666c4dbf95f449394c3e7f7e8fe0bcc4c/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=decf91bb84d5d43474acd34300978d29","title":"christmas postal strike looms after royal mail workers vote for action","story":"Royal Mail workers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of striking in a dispute over job security and employment terms and conditions, raising the threat of industrial action in the run-up to Christmas.The CWU said Royal Mail was not sticking to an agreement reached last year covering a wide range of issues, including plans to reduce the working week, as well as job security.Industrial relations at the company have worsened this year, with widespread unofficial strikes breaking out virtually every week.Terry Pullinger, the CWU’s deputy general secretary, said the union and its members were facing the “fight of our lives”.The CWU said the result represented the largest vote in favour of national industrial action since the passing of the Trade Union Act 2016.The union said the prospect of the first national postal strike in a decade now “looms large”.Pullinger said: “Just over one year ago the Royal Mail Group Board and the CWU agreed a blueprint agreement for the future, a progressive agreement that included a historic pension solution, a mutual interest driven relationship and a joint vision for a successful postal service with social aims.“Today the new RMG leadership are breaking that agreement.“Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British postal service in the interest of fast-track profit and greed.“Integrity and pride still matters and we will not stand aside and see what we have spent our working lives building destroyed.”Dave Ward, the CWU’s general secretary, said: “This result sends a clear message to Royal Mail Group – our members will not stand by as you rip up their terms and conditions and destroy the service they give to the public and businesses of the UK.“We would urge Royal Mail Group to now enter serious negotiations with this union. We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.“We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.”The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said Royal Mail was an example of a “privatisation failure” following news of the strike action.“Thousands of posties have voted yes in record numbers for strike action in defence of their jobs,” he tweeted. “Royal Mail is a Tory-Lib Dem privatisation failure.“Its selloff led to shareholders creaming profits off the top while running down the service.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43a7d0fa640b3756d915d2c68c58e8298a2f417/0_138_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19436fb58a872b1d91041ea32325f0","title":"no deal brexit food shortages are you a small business owner whos stockpiling","story":"We’d like to hear from small business owners about how they are preparing ahead of BrexitWith the cut-off date to secure a Brexit deal looming, the likely outcome of negotiations this week is still uncertain.

Long before the 14 million who now call Ontario home got here, the place was shaped forever by glacial erosion that gouged and quarried so much of the land that falls within the province’s boundaries.The result left Ontario with upwards of 250,000 lakes, and while the province boasts Canada’s largest city in Toronto and its capital city in Ottawa, it is away from the urban centres that it truly offers itself as a paradise for nature lovers.Ontario is a place for all comers and all seasons. Adventure arrives adrenaline soaked or at a much slower pace … with plenty of options in between. And the best of those options usually come on, or at least very near, a body of water.In the rustic cabins and cottages that hug every one of those quarter of a million lakes, kitschy slogan wall hangings are ubiquitous, but the advice they offer is nothing if not accurate: “Life is better at the lake.”Head downstream from Lake Ontario to the mouth of the mighty St Lawrence River and you’ll reach 1,000 Islands, an archipelago of more than 1,800 islands that straddle the Canadian and US border. Cruise the islands from Kingston, Gananoque or Rockport all the way up the St Lawrence to take in stunning seasonal views. And yes, these same islands are forever commemorated in a condiment – the eponymous salad dressing originates from these parts.But of course there’s a lot more to do in 1,000 Islands than just cruise around. There is a plethora of outdoor activities of varying levels of intensity, available for everyone to partake in. Alongside the obligatory boating, swimming and paddling, try cycling the 1,000 Islands Parkway Trail in summer – a glorious, winding 24-mile stretch skirting the coves and bays between Gananoque and Brockville. Meanwhile, the cooler months bring with them a whole array of new activities, from hiking the Marble Rock conservation area to high-octane snowmobile runs through the island backcountry.Less than two-and-a-half hours east from the hustle of Toronto, Prince Edward County is an idyllic escape on Lake Ontario. Technically an island, it juts out into the eastern corner of the lake near the head of the St Lawrence River. A permanent home for almost 25,000 people, the county opens its arms to visitors who come for its mix of natural beauty, endless action options and one of the most happening artisanal food and drink scenes in Canada.Sandbanks provincial park is the undoubted star of the county, a sprawling natural expanse that connects three beaches and ranks as the world’s largest freshwater sand bar and dune system. Hiking trails crisscross the park and the pristine waters are perfect for a dip in summer. But don’t be afraid to take things up a notch nearby (especially when the breeze picks up) with some kiteboarding and sailing lessons under the expert tutelage of the AirTime Kiteboarding team. Canoe and kayak rental options abound too.No matter what you’ve been getting up to, it’s not difficult to work up an appetite in the county. The best way to do so might well be by first quenching your thirst on two wheels. Cycle-and-sip tours of the island’s up-and-coming wineries are outrageously good fun. But don’t miss out on the brewery scene either (the area is renowned for its ciders), with Midtown and Parsons being the pick of the bunch.Picton, the island’s main hub is full of excellent dining and drinking options such as Hartley’s Tavern and 555 Brewing Co, but perhaps the biggest name around is the Drake Devonshire, located in the nearby waterfront town of Wellington. Billing itself as the ultra-hip country sister to its iconic downtown Toronto original, the Drake Devonshire delivers just as consistently as its urban sibling when it comes to the kitchen. Splurge and stay overnight at one of its unique rooms where every artsy detail is obsessed over. The Drake team also recently opened a more cost-conscious – but still cool – option next door with their Motor Inn.Meanwhile, the nearby Muskoka region – or as Ontarians call it, “cottage country” – is both a relaxation and outdoor adventure hub.The region is, like so many others in Ontario, famous for its lakes – and there’s no shortage of action to be had out on the water or hugging the shoreline. There are plenty of great options for canoeing, kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding, as well as angling and boating trips and tours aplenty. But for a truly wild thrill, try flyboarding, the newest adrenaline rush available on water. Think of a flyboard as a water-powered jetpack for your feet. It sucks the water from the wake of a boat or jetski through an 18-metre hose and propels you high up over the lake. If it sounds unbelievable, just try it for yourself in Muskoka.Back on dry land, step up your adventure settings with a visit to Muskoka Zip Lines and Aerial Park. Clamber over rope bridges and obstacles in the treetop aerial adventure course, or take the zip line canopy tour crisscrossing the park for a fast and fun high-altitude thrill over seven connected zip lines. For those inclined to keep their feet a bit closer to solid ground, take a horseback trail ride with Winding Fences Farm across the beautiful open terrain in the pastures surrounding the town of Windermere.Those looking for an all-frills, all-inclusive experience will find it at the JW Marriott The Rosseau Muskoka. Not only is this luxury resort and spa considered one of Canada’s finest, but its outdoor adventure options include stand-up paddleboarding, canoeing and kayaking from its exclusive lakeside beach, as well as a spectacular new 180-metre zipline that runs across the Five Bridges Trail on the resort’s grounds.Ontario’s adrenaline hotspot – the Blue Mountain resort, which not only boasts the province’s best winter sports but an amazing variety of activities the other nine months of the year – sits on the shores of another of the Great Lakes, Lake Huron. In the summer months, just 10 minutes from the resort is a private beach on the shores of Georgian Bay, where visitors can surf, and rent boats, canoes, kayaks and paddleboards, alongside other fun, family friendly activities on shore, from the Timber Challenge High Ropes Course to the Ridge Runner Mountain Coaster. Of course, when you’re ready to take things down a gear or two, the resort’s pedestrian-friendly village has a fantastic offering of restaurants, bars and pubs, as well as a great entertainment programme featuring live music and other events such as Movies Under the Stars.There’s also the perfect excuse to seriously chill at the Scandinave Spa Blue Mountain. Located in a tranquil forest, the spa has a strict “no electronic devices” policy to ensure maximum unwind time. But when you’re basking in thermal and Nordic waterfalls, hot baths and Finnish and infrared saunas, why would you want to be thinking about the outside world anyway?While no trip to Ontario could be considered complete without at least one trek through Algonquin provincial park in search of that blessed moose, or (from a distance) bear sighting, during the summer months fun on the water takes centre stage. Algonquin is home to dozens of lakes and small tributaries, and while some of them are only accessible through the backcountry, Algonquin Outfitters offers a number of excursions, from wildlife spotting day trips to canoeing. You could also try Parkbus, a fantastic and sustainable transport service that ensures city dwellers and tourists can fully connect with nature. Stops in Algonquin include paddlers’ paradise, Lake Opeongo and the serene Pog Lake.Of course it’s not just about the resort towns and big name outdoor destinations, there are plenty of adventures to be had throughout cottage country – with ample options to hike, get out on the water or just generally unwind. From Haliburton to Huntsville and south to Gravenhurst, there are local gems with water access for lazy morning kayaking and nearby trails for afternoon hikes. And for those who really want to get away from it all, Cabinscape offers tiny custom-made, ecologically friendly cabins perched in the wilderness of southern Ontario – and some of the options are so off-grid that they’re hike-in access only.But much like the wider province itself, it’s the far-off corners that reveal Ontario’s true character – a little rugged, a little wild, altogether unforgettable.Start planning your visit to Ontario this winter with Canadian Affair"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/277b8fa15735eb367a22969bdb94a884d972cdd0/335_0_4159_2496/master/4159.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb33867fc2c0a2f67a3be5de8a6999fe","title":"rise renewables oil firms decades earlier think","story":"Pace of progress raises hope that fossil fuel companies could lose their dominationThe world’s rising reliance on fossil fuels may come to an end decades earlier than the most polluting companies predict, offering early signs of hope in the global battle to tackle the climate crisis.The climate green shoots have emerged amid a renewable energy revolution that promises an end to the rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, before the fossil fuels face a terminal decline.The looming fossil fuel peak is expected to emerge decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies, which are betting that demand for polluting energy will rise until the 2040s.But energy experts are adjusting their forecasts as clean energy technologies, including wind and solar power, emerge faster than predicted and at costs that pose a direct threat to coal-fired electricity and combustion-engine vehicles.The pace of progress has raised hope that the global groundswell of climate protest could spark fresh political will to accelerate the energy transition in time to keep global temperatures from rising to levels that could trigger a climate catastrophe.The UK Labour party has promised a Green Industrial Revolution to create almost 70,000 new jobs while working to create a carbon-neutral economy by 2030. In the US, the Green New Deal, spearheaded by the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, aims to virtually eliminate the US’s greenhouse gas emissions within the next decade.Within the energy industry, experts believe the rapid rise of renewable energy in recent years may soon seem glacial compared with the changes to come.Michael Liebreich, the founder of the research group Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF), says the substitution of old technology with new is always “like waiting for a sneeze”.The world is about to enter this period of rapid transformation, he says. This change promises to upend the fossil fuel producers that fail to adapt at pace, and bring the rise of carbon emissions to an end. A growing number of energy experts agree.“Over the next decade we’ll see a far quicker than expected rollout of a number of clean energy technologies, which will almost certainly mean global emissions plateau,” Liebreich adds.The rollout is expected whether politicians increase their ambition or not, because the economics of clean energy are now too strong to ignore.Earlier this summer, BNEF reported that not only was renewable energy cheaper than building a new gas or coal plant, but it would soon be cheaper than using existing thermal plants too.This economic tipping point means it would save money to shut existing coal-fired power plants down and build new renewable energy projects from scratch. Abundant clean electricity could help remove the emissions from the world’s transport and heating systems too. has collaborated with leading scientists and NGOs to expose, with exclusive data, investigations and analysis, the fossil fuel companies that are perpetuating the climate crisis – some of which have accelerated their extraction of coal, oil and gas even as the devastating impact on the planet and humanity was becoming clear.The investigation has involved more than 20  journalists working across the world for the past six months.The project focuses on what the companies have extracted from the ground, and the subsequent emissions they are responsible for, since 1965. The analysis, undertaken by Richard Heede at the Climate Accountability Institute,\u0026nbspcalculates how much carbon is emitted throughout the supply chain, from extraction to use by consumers. Heede said: The fact that consumers combust the fuels to carbon dioxide, water, heat and pollutants does not absolve the fossil fuel companies from responsibility for knowingly perpetuating the carbon era and accelerating the climate crisis toward the existential threat it has now become.One aim of the project is to move the focus of debate from inidual responsibilities to power structures – so our reporters also examined the financial and lobbying structures that let fossil fuel firms keep growing, and discovered which elected politicians were voting for change.\u0026nbspAnother aim of the project is to press governments and corporations to close the gap between ambitious long-term promises and lacklustre short-term action. The UN says the coming decade is crucial if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic consequences of global heating. Reining in our dependence on fossil fuels and dramatically accelerating the transition to renewable energy has never been more urgent.By 2030, BNEF expects demand for road fuels to peak, while coal is expected to peak by 2026. DNV GL, a global energy advisory, believes that by the same year oil will no longer be the world’s biggest energy source, and by the end of the 2020s the world’s demand for crude will begin to fall.“It provides a lot of hope,” says Seb Henbest, the lead author of the BNEF report. “It provides a counterbalance to the doom and gloom we face, partly because it includes up-to-date data which tells a slightly different story.”It is a cautionary tale for fossil fuel companies that believe the world’s demand for polluting energy will continue to rise until the middle of the century. It is also a new narrative of hope, he says.“We’re a lot further on than we were. And yes, we need to go faster. And yes, it’s difficult and complicated. But at the same time we now live in a world where two-thirds of the global population live in a country where wind and solar power is the cheapest form of new electricity capacity. We have the tools to do this,” he says.Chris Stark, the head of the UK’s official climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, says the precedent set by the renewables industry proves that emerging technologies to capture carbon emissions can follow suit.The progress to date is not yet enough to meet global targets set in the Paris climate agreement, but a plateau in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 could play a major role in averting catastrophic global heating above 3C. It also proves that further ambition could bring the world closer to the sub-2C goal.“This change is a testament to new climate policies, and the work that has been done around the world. We need to do more of that,” he adds.The UK plans to lead the world’s future climate ambitions. Next year, Glasgow will host the UN’s 26th Conference of the Parties climate talks, known as COP26, to set out a roadmap that keeps rising temperatures well within 2C above pre-industrialised levels.Claire Perry MP, the president for COP26, says the climate talks are “where the rubber hits the road on the historic Paris agreement”. She adds that “expectations are rightly high” due to the “mounting public concern over climate change”, but the UK is ready to deliver on those expectations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554f9c8e448ee31bb42c2ebaf91308d977278a6a/6_0_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c95da73b1eec7296d154c0e18f3d1a88","title":"barbaric tests on monkeys lead to calls for closure of german lab","story":"Shocking footage shows conditions ‘clearly breach’ EU standards on animal welfare, say campaignersAn animal testing laboratory in Germany that subjected monkeys to “barbaric” treatment and kept unwell dogs in squalid conditions is under investigation amid calls for its closure.Undercover footage at the Laboratory of Pharmacology and Toxicology (LPT) near Hamburg published by Cruelty Free International and Soko Tierschutz shows technicians with metal prongs grabbing macaque monkeys by the neck. The monkeys are restrained by braces during testing. The footage also shows primates being handled “violently” by technicians: in one incident a monkey has its head smacked against a door frame.Some of the monkeys appeared to be kept alone in metal cages measuring less than a cubic metre and are seen spinning in circles, indicating high levels of distress. They were reportedly forced to stand for long periods. Dogs are pictured laying in what seemed to be their own blood and faeces, with one beagle in a cage appearing to be bleeding. Staff also appeared to mishandle cats.The footage provoked an angry response from campaigners who said that suffering was clearly not being kept to a minimum, as required by law in many countries.Kate Willett, of Humane Society US, said the use of restraints was “barbaric” and described the conditions animals were kept in as “appalling”.“The technicians are treating the animals violently,” she said. “This kind of treatment is ethically insupportable and quite possibly illegal. Each country develops its own animal care guidelines, but dogs housed in these appalling conditions would not be up to the standards of the US or the UK, and it has serious ramifications for the quality of the scientific results.”Any data collected from the animals would be “virtually useless”, she said, since their physiology would be altered by the stresses they were experiencing.“It’s time for this type of testing to be relegated to the history bin,” she added. “There are new, non-animal methodologies available for safety testing so to see this type of abuse going on in in the name of science in the 21st century is unforgivable.”Since 2015, nine inspections have taken place at the facility, seven of which were unannounced. One unannounced visit took place on 8 October when evidence of the abuse was reported to authorities, and another a week later.Inspectors observed that 44 monkeys were kept “in far too small cages” and reported “long-term harm and considerable suffering”. However, the monkeys were not used in tests during the inspections.The facility was fined €300 (£260) on one occasion because it introduced new dogs without permission, according to the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, which broke the story. LPT said last Thursday that the authorities had never objected to its “animal husbandry”, according to the paper.Cruelty Free International said the conditions “clearly breach” minimum EU animal welfare requirements and called for the closure of the facility.“By failing to adopt methods that could reduce the suffering and stress experienced by the monkeys, dogs and cats, LPT are falling short of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) mandatory under EU and German legislation,” a spokesperson said.“This cannot be tolerated, and we are calling for this laboratory to be closed and a full investigation by the German authorities.”Soko, a charity campaigning for animal rights, said the footage demonstrated a “horrendous mixture of suffering and cruelty” and that the practices breached German and EU legislation.“It is unthinkable that this should be happening in a country that has animal protection in its constitution,” said Soko’s Friedrich Mülln. “We call on the German government to take immediate action to close LPT and to end these cruel and outdated poisoning tests.”In July the European commission said there were “numerous failings” in German domestic law regarding the minimisation of the number of animals used in experiments and called on the country to “correctly enact” EU directives.Cruelty Free International said the beagles at the laboratory were bred in the US and exported to Germany. They are understood to have been supplied by one of the major global suppliers of dogs. The primates were bred in China.The breeding industry that supplies laboratories around the world has faced growing scrutiny as countries have moved to ban animal testing for cosmetic products and other uses. In 2005 it was estimated that about 115m animals had been used in laboratory experiments that year. Most are killed afterwards. In the UK, there are two facilities where the typically docile beagles that are used for research are bred. They are owned by US group Marshall Bioresources.Although the use of primates and dogs in research is more carefully regulated than it used to be, they are still used regularly. More than 60,000 dogs and 70,000 primates were used in the US alone in 2016.LPT, which operates the testing facility in Mienenbüttel, near Hamburg, where the company has its headquarters, is one of the largest private laboratories in Germany and employs 175 people. On its website, it claims to work in accordance with national and international guidelines. An animal rights activist who worked there for several months earlier this year recorded the footage.The facility, which among other functions performs toxicity tests on behalf of pharmaceutical companies to measure safe doses of medication for humans, has long faced protests from animal rights activists. A demonstration is planned locally on Saturday in response to the revelations. Germany’s agriculture minister, Julia Klöckner, told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung last year that the government was committed to adapting German laws to ensure compliance with EU directives and lowering the numbers of animals used. “I want the number of experiments on animals to be continuously reduced,” Klöckner said. “Animals are fellow creatures and they deserve our sympathy.”In 2014 an undercover investigation at a neuroscience facility in Tübingen owned by the Max Planck Society revealed the “brutal” conditions in which animals were kept and spelled the end for the institute’s controversial monkey brain experiments.In response to the latest scandal, the local authority said that criminal charges had been lodged with the state prosecutor due to suspected unlawful activity.A spokesperson said: “The veterinary office responded promptly, after we were informed of the video footage, which indicates significant maladministration in the LPT facility, and carried out a comprehensive and unannounced inspection.“For this reason, the Harburg district has filed criminal charges with the prosecutor. We regret that animals have suffered as a result of noncompliant husbandry conditions and will consistently remedy all identified grievances … with all legally available means.”They added: “The challenge for the competent authorities is to examine what is and is not allowed under current legislation on animal testing and animal husbandry.” A former federal agriculture minister, Renate Künast von den Grünen, a current Bundestag member, told Süddeutsche Zeitung last Friday: “The expertise of those who carry out animal experiments is currently not sufficiently regulated.”LPT did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e980deb61d1b0bddd76cf3bfc32dc2b9b572880/2_0_8885_5333/master/8885.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce06e242eb6787891ee4d9127fe33ba","title":"dark floral winter flower floral patterns","story":"Winter florals are glamorous but casual, womanly rather than girlish – and are an instant style updateYou probably think this is about a trend. It’s not. Floral patterns on a dark background is not so much a fashion trend as a fashion takeover. It is a look that is absolutely everywhere – so much so, that you have probably stopped noticing it. It is in my wardrobe and – as a glance around the  office confirms – in a whole lot of other wardrobes too. The formula is simple: flowers of any variety bloom against a dark-coloured background. Perhaps on a blouse, possibly a trousersuit or an evening gown, but most likely on a dress or a skirt.Without much fuss or fanfare, dark floral has lodged itself into modern life. Like the Breton stripe a decade before it, it has become style shorthand for looking current. And for looking good, but not looking as if you thought about it too much. Alessandro Michele’s super-maximalist aesthetic at Gucci has amped up the resting pulse rate of fashion, so you need a bit of print and colour for an outfit to feel really contemporary. On the other hand, the mood music of the #MeToo era doesn’t lend itself to a bunting-and-cupcakes vibe, so viewing the traditional femininity of the floral print through a darker lens feels right. And as fashion moves towards a more sustainable, less fast-moving model, a print that is a bit summery (because, flowers) and at the same time autumnal in its colours also feels right for now.Erdem Moralioglu has been making winter florals look super-chic for most of his career. For his autumn 2009 collection, he embroidered tiny, intensely coloured chrysanthemums and violets on to black dresses. Explaining how his colour scheme had taken a moody turn that season, he said at the time that the muse he had previously imagined “running free and romantic in the meadows” had now “visited nightclubs and gone home on the bus”. Ten years later, he is still into a moody bloom: this season’s Reese dress, £520, has tightly furled peonies and sprigs of cherry blossom against a black background.“I’ve always been fascinated by women and all things that imply femininity,” he says. “Flowers are an extension of that – beautiful, complex, sometimes dangerous. I like the contrast of a delicate floral print on a dark base, with little secrets hidden in the artwork. There is something wonderful about things that can be both pretty and dark at the same time.”“Glasual” – glamorous and casual – is the new smart-casual. Smart-casual looks a bit meh these days, while glasual fits the dressier, look-at-me vibe of the Instagram era. The winter floral is instantly, effortlessly glasual. It is ideal for day-to-night wear where animal print can feel a bit too much of a stretch first thing in the morning, florals have a long history as daywear. Fast-forward to cocktail hour and the moody, jewels-on-black-velvet colour combination brings just enough edge.The dark floral dress is fashion with a little “f” rather than a big one, but it is also A Bit French. It started with London-based designers – Alexander McQueen, as well as Erdem – but is now all over Paris, too. It is on the catwalk at Christian Dior and Dries Van Noten, and all over the streets of Paris. Every chic Parisienne’s current favourite haute high-street label, Sézane – tagline “French everybody can speak” – is selling a Penelope dress, £135, with tiny bright flowers on black.“Small flowers on a dark pattern is a timeless pattern,” says brand founder Morgane Sézalory. “It is not a specific trend but something that really goes through the time. During fall and winter, it is always a staple to have in your wardrobe. The print works really well on a midi or long dress with a pair of boots.”“While summer florals exude pretty femininity, there is something more edgy and dramatic about winter florals,” she says. “They are also incredibly versatile – great to style with dark separates and knitwear and more subtle than a flirty summer print. I smarten mine up with an oversized coat and boots, or dress down with some trainers and wear in the office every day.”The dark floral is Anna Wintour at Wimbledon. It is Michelle Obama at a state dinner. It is Janelle Monáe on the red carpet. It is the beauty of flowers as painted in oil by the Dutch masters, rather than in postcard watercolours. It is smart but not stuffy, womanly rather than girlish. Dark florals are not just a trend, because they show no sign of wilting. These are the flowers that never die.

I saw the referee stopped the game but I also have to say the behaviour was also not only on behalf of the Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and shouting during the Bulgarian national anthem. During the second half they used words against our fans which I find unacceptable.”The comments by Iliev and Balakov contrasted heavily with those of the captain Ivelin Popov, who had tried to calm things during the game by speaking to some of the fans. “First, I tried to talk with the stewards who were supposed to control the situation,” the Rostov midfielder said. “We’re all suffering from that kind of behaviour. Do you think a foreign player would like to come and play in Bulgaria after what happened tonight? Racism is a world problem that needs to be eradicated. We’re all people regardless of the skin colour.”The racist chanting dominated the headlines in Bulgaria on Tuesday morning. “There’s no light! It’s been buried beneath six goals and tons of shame,” read the headline of the sports website Gong.bg, with the accompanying piece saying: “Bulgarian football and the country as a whole suffered one of the most shameful nights in its entire history – not only was the national team beaten 6-0 by England but the game was twice stopped for racist chants. A handful of fans stained not only Bulgarian football but Bulgaria as a country after racially abusing the England internationals.”Another sports website, Sportal.bg, went with “Such a shame! A historic humiliation”, while one of the most famous TV pundits in Bulgaria, Borislav Borisov, said: “Every country’s national team is an institution but on Monday night our national team was destroyed. With the way England reacted to the racial abuse they wanted to make a statement – they wanted to stand up against racism and they did it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e750edf623f7d30e62d52c73dd0e9231b671486a/0_50_2398_1438/master/2398.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa26c0c09a8e48a6f057487eb0269e21","title":"england tyrone mings bulgaria debut composure","story":"“Did you hear that?” With those four words, Tyrone Mings set in motion a process that could have seen England walk off the pitch and abandon their match against Bulgaria on Monday night. In the end they did not, with action against the persistent racist abuse from the stands of Sofia’s Vasil Levski Stadium stopping short of the ultimate step in Uefa’s three-point protocol. But the way that Mings dealt with his experience, and the way his England teammates and coaches did too, might perhaps have a longer-term effect in the struggle against racism. Did you hear that Uefa? Did you hear that people at home?It was certainly not the kind of environment in which anyone should have to make their international debut. Mings, the Aston Villa centre-half, said he and his teammates had clocked racist chanting from sections of the Bulgarian support before the match had even started. Then, halfway through the first half, and amid a hail of monkey noises, not to mention Nazi salutes in the stands and a general sense that parts of the local crowd were there for the abuse and not the football, the game came to a halt. Warning messages were read to the crowd over the PA system before play restarted but it stopped again just before half-time. At the interval as many as 50 of the most abusive supporters left the ground.“I didn’t hear anything in the second half,” Mings said. “I can’t speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself. So I think fans were removed and if that was the case then I think the protocol has definitely worked. We didn’t want to be having these conversations but it was important we made a collective decision. We represent a lot of people and we have to not just make a stance for ourselves, but make it clear these things won’t be accepted“It didn’t affect my feelings. I think I’m quite lucky in that way because I don’t feel like it is a personal assault. I feel sorry for the people who have those views. But I also have a duty to represent people that don’t have a voice, so it didn’t hurt or harm my feelings one bit. It was obviously bigger than me and bigger than what I felt.”The considerate words and Mings’ composed demeanour, in the stadium afterwards and in passing his warning to the officials, were in keeping with a man whose measured and compassionate attitude on a number of social issues has been informed by challenging first-hand experience.Now 26 years of age and a £26m player following his summer transfer to Villa Park from Bournemouth, Mings spent part of his childhood living in a homeless shelter. There was one room for him, his mother and three sisters. At this time the youngster was also part of the Southampton academy set-up, only later to be dropped as a teenager. He had to build his career up from scratch, first by earning a football scholarship to a private school, then by playing non-league football and Yate Town and Chippenham Town before finally being picked up by Mick McCarthy’s Ipswich. As he climbed up the ladder, Mings also became known as someone who gave back, helping the homeless in his home town of Bath, setting up a football academy for kids across the south-west.His four-year stint at Bournemouth, which was blighted by injury, brought 10 league starts and only now is Mings able to begin his career as a Premier League player in earnest. He has quickly established himself as the fulcrum around which Villa’s defence depends and his early season form was enough to get him selected for England for their two matches in September. He did not play then but in making his bow against Bulgaria his play matched his performance off the pitch.Composure was the quality Mings brought most obviously to the field. Admittedly he was not against the most challenging of opponents, but he wasn’t threatened by the physical presence of the lone striker Ismail Isa, nor troubled by the movement – and more intensive pressing – of Isa’s second-half replacement, Galin Ivanov.Mings, always identified as comfortable with the ball at his feet, slotted well into this England side that look to build possession from the back. He even took it upon himself to push forward when the opportunity allowed, one second-half dribble taking him into the Bulgaria box. He was forced to turn back at that point but, sensibly, Mings kept possession.Having not anticipated a place in Monday’s XI, Mings had to take last-minute measures to get his family to the match when Gareth Southgate told him he would be earning his first cap. He paid for his family’s travel to Sofia and, despite the circumstances, Mings was in no doubt about what the moment meant to him.“It is the pinnacle of English football everybody dreams of representing their country, everybody knows my journey. I was extremely proud and had my friends and family in the crowd, so I don’t think they will let it overshadow this.“I was absolutely happy they were here tonight and it will be a memory we will talk about for a long, long time – a good memory.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b793ac86b8563ea512c9975d0b36a65ee4ac88ec/0_10_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c79392fe26307caa75385f9db7371fdf","title":"expel teams from tournaments over racism urges kick it out chief bulgaria england","story":"Uefa has charged the Bulgarian football union over the racist behaviour of its fans at Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against England. The Football Association is also facing sanctions after being charged for the disruption of the Bulgarian national anthem by England supporters and for having an insufficient number of travelling stewards.On a lengthy Uefa charge sheet the most significant aspect was the reference to chants and Nazi salutes by Bulgaria fans. However both national associations were also charged over the disruption of national anthems and among the other charges was one for the BFU relating to the throwing of objects from the stands.The move came as Uefa’s president, Aleksander Ceferin, defended its punishments for racism as “among the toughest in sport” and called on for a “war” on discrimination after the game in Sofia was twice halted because of persistent racial abuse from home supporters.Ceferin said the help of governments and the whole “football family” was required to tackle racism on the day Downing Street accused Uefa of not dealing adequately with the problem and called for strong action against the BFU, whose president, Borislav Mihaylov, resigned on Tuesday.With the anti-racism charity Kick It Out leading calls for Uefa to consider excluding teams from major tournaments to tackle discrimination, it remains to be seen whether the governing body will go further than ordering Bulgaria to play their next home game behind closed doors. That was Montenegro’s punishment after England’s players endured similar racial abuse during the qualifier in Podgorica in March. No date has been set for hearing the charges relating to Monday night.“Believe me, Uefa is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football,” Ceferin told the Associated Press. “We cannot afford to be content with this. We must always strive to strengthen our resolve. More broadly, the football family – everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans – needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society.”Ceferin added: “Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area.”A section of the Vasil Levski Stadium in Sofia was closed on Monday after Uefa imposed sanctions over racist incidents during Bulgaria’s qualifiers against Kosovo and the Czech Republic in June, and the punishment is also due to cover the home game against the Czech Republic next month.“Uefa’s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches,” Ceferin said. “The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters.”In a further defence of his organisation’s approach, Ceferin said: “Some of the views expressed about Uefa’s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark.”The Football Association chairman, Greg Clarke, has called for authorities to show “zero tolerance”.Downing Street said Nigel Adams, the sports minister, was to write to Uefa to demand immediate action. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “The racism we saw and heard last night was vile and has no place in football or anywhere else. The England players and management showed tremendous dignity. The prime minister commends the players who were targeted for this despicable abuse for their response. Uefa need to face up to facts. This stain on football is not being adequately dealt with.“Racism and discrimination must be driven out of football once and for all. We support the FA’s calls for an investigation with tough penalties to follow. We are writing to Uefa today to ask for this to be conducted swiftly.”In the House of Commons, Rosena Allin-Khan, the shadow sports minister, said: “Uefa has a duty to act here, the world is watching. A fine is not enough, so I am asking our government to ensure that we are backing up the FA to seek the harshest possible punishment. Stadium bans are a must, forfeiting matches and expulsion from tournaments must not be ruled out.”The anti-discrimination group Fare has said it will help Uefa build a “legally safe” case to prosecute Bulgaria. Kick It Out’s chief executive, Roisin Wood, said: “I think there has to be a massively thorough investigation. The fines from Uefa we don’t think are enough. There have to be serious steps now, and that should include looking at expulsion or not letting people enter tournaments, because there has to be a clear message. This is 2019. These are professional players going out to play. You would never expect to get this in your workplace so why should professional players get it in theirs?”Bulgaria’s manager, Krasimir Balakov, has faced criticism for claiming in post-match interviews that he did not hear any racist chanting. One English football reporter, Simon Peach of Press Association, wrote on Twitter: “A few locals tutted when I asked a follow-up question about whether he was surprised the match was halted given he was unaware of any racism.”Another English journalist at the game, Kaveh Solhekol, reported that Gareth Southgate’s post-match press conference was interrupted by a Bulgarian journalist “convinced racism at the game was not as bad as we witnessed”.

Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!The Fiver preferred it when Borislav Mihaylov was best known in this country for his funny little syrup. Now he will probably be remembered as the face of a governing body that made itself the embarrassment of world football before, during and after Monday night’s match against England. Mihaylov, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union, has resigned in response to the large-scale racist abuse that completely overshadowed England’s 6-0 win in Sofia. He was given little option by the Bulgarian prime minister. “It is unacceptable that Bulgaria – which is one of the most tolerant states in the world and where people of different ethnic and religious background peacefully live together – should be associated with racism,” tweeted Boyko Borissov, before suggesting that Mihaylov might wish to consider an alternative career path at his earliest convenience.Mihaylov had written an open letter to Uefa last week, criticising England for responding to questions about how they would react to any racist abuse during the game. Their stance was put to the test, wearyingly and inevitably, with the match halted twice in the first half after England players complained about a spectrum of abuse including monkey chants and Nazi salutes. The collection of wrong’uns congregating behind one goal, in particular, looked like they had been teleported to the match from the Stone Age.Most Bulgarians were ashamed. The captain, Ivelin Popov, spent half-time appealing to the better nature of some of the home supporters. His coach, Krassimir Balakov, meanwhile, achieved the rare feat of having his fingers in his ears while his head was in the sand. “If our captain spoke to the fans, it was probably because of the way the team was performing, and the whole topic in the build-up to the game,” he said, putting the crass in Krassimir. “I didn’t hear anything. If something happened, I’m sure it was a small group of people who were really were out of their minds because it was unacceptable, if it happened of course. I also have to say the unacceptable behaviour was not only on the behalf of Bulgarian fans but also the English fans, who were whistling and chanting during the national anthem and used words against our fans in the second half which I found unacceptable.” England fans called the home supporters “racist ba$tards” via the medium of song.The goalkeeper, Plamen Iliev, also said the home fans “behaved well” and that England “overreacted”. The reality, of course, is that England and everyone else have underreacted to racism in football for decades. It soon became clear on Monday, however, after the visceral revulsion, that a precedent had been set and something profound had occurred. “I’m incredibly proud of the players and all the staff,” said Gareth Southgate. “It’s such a difficult area as not everyone will agree we’ve gone far enough but I still believe we’ve made a huge statement. The game was stopped twice – I don’t believe that’s happened in international football.”Whatever England do under Southgate, they have surely left a legacy as a team who did more than pay lip service to the fight against racism – not just in Bulgaria, but in England and everywhere else 14 October 2019 already feels like one of the more significant dates in the history of the England national team. Of course, the most famous moment in English football occurred when some people were on the pitch, thinking it was all over. On Monday night, another landmark moment occurred when some players weren’t on the pitch. And while nobody thinks racism is all over, we can only hope it took one hell of a beating.Join Will Unwin from 7.45pm for hot clockwatch coverage of the day’s Euro 2020 qualifiers.15 October 2019: “Uefa needs to face up to facts.

Rather than being able to focus solely on how to improve on a debut season that brought a French league title, a cup final and an infuriating last-16 exit to Manchester United in the Champions League, the Paris Saint-Germain manager was fielding questions about the future of Neymar.On and on it went. From the moment the first reports of Neymar wanting to leave appeared, through to the moment he did not return for the first day of pre-season to finally playing his first club game of the season on 14 September, the story was always about the Brazilian rather than the team.Not that Tuchel was surprised. He knows what it entails being the manager of PSG and is not complaining. The Neymar saga may have overshadowed the start of the season but PSG are top of Ligue 1 by two points and lead their Champions League group after two wins in two games, including a 3-0 victory over Real Madrid. Tuchel can be happy when they are 11 games into the season and there are signs the relationship between Neymar and the fans is slowly healing.“The supporters have expressed their opinions and I can understand them, absolutely. It’s their right to express themselves,” he says as we sit down for our interview as part of my work for beIN Sports France. “They’re proud of their club and it’s not so nice when you hear your player talking for weeks and weeks saying he wants to leave. As I told Neymar, sometimes it’s like this in life – you have to face the truth and deal with the consequences.”Once the transfer window closed with Neymar still at PSG, the manager’s job was to reintegrate and remotivate a player for whom he has great affection. “Neymar has a good heart,” Tuchel says. “Sometimes it’s a bit hard to see that he is a nice person when you only watch him play from outside. But he is, he’s a nice guy.“I told him: ‘You think the hardest part is over but from now on you have to deal with me and I’m going to push you hard. So the hardest thing is still to come for you.’”Tuchel’s pushing seems to be working. Neymar has scored winning goals for PSG against Strasbourg and Lyon, with further strikes against Bordeaux and Angers, although he was ruled out for four weeks with a hamstring injury on Monday. Bigger tests await for Tuchel, with the Champions League last 16 looming in February as a make-or-break moment once again for a PSG manager. I ask him how he measures success at a club such as his. Is it simply a question of points or is there something more to it?“I have no clear definition,” he says. “Points count, definitely, titles count if you go to a club like PSG, that’s the way it is. But there’s also the relationships with the players, the connection with the players, sometimes helping a player through a difficult period in his career. That’s also success, no? Hopefully I don’t depend too much on the points and the titles because the possibility that you get sad or that you don’t fulfil your own goals is too high. There’s more to life than points and trophies but we’re all very competitive and we all want to win every game.“Sometimes you work hard helping players through tough times and you work hard in building a team and creating connections and then you see your team work so well together in a really tight match and you think, ‘Wow, what a great job we did over the past however many weeks.’ But nobody out there knows what you’ve really achieved. All the little things you achieve every day are like little rewards for me. From the outside it’s all much simpler and it’s just about winning.”The German arrived at PSG in 2018 after two seasons at Borussia Dortmund followed by a year’s sabbatical. In the French capital he has won the league but that is expected at a club who have Kylian Mbappé, Neymar and Edinson Cavani in the forward line. Tuchel has a remarkable squad at his disposal but when asked whether he has ever experienced a perfect game, he says: “Never had one, never been close and still on the hunt. Still looking for one and still loving the training and still looking for the perfect training session, too. I like to think we get closer and closer all the time.“You have these periods where you really think, ‘Yes, this is it’ but the tension is so high in these games that you cannot fully enjoy it. Football is a game where lots of mistakes happen and the ability to deal with the mistakes is also a quality. You have to accept as a coach that there will not be a perfect game. It is sad, of course. It’s a bit like Sisyphus, isn’t it? You never quite get there.“Our recent game against Real Madrid makes you very happy as a coach, of course. Winning big games can bring a lot of satisfaction, like winning at Old Trafford last season and beating Liverpool at home. You have amazing feelings and you love this job because you see so many good things. It can get close to perfection but never quite attain it.”In the meantime Tuchel, who speaks fluent English and gets by pretty well in French, will continue his quest to become better acquainted with the city of Paris. A family man with two young daughters (who, he says with a laugh, only recently discovered there could be other things on the television screen at home than football matches), Tuchel would like to have more time and freedom for cultural pursuits. He is still coming to terms with a profile that often means he will be recognised, even in Paris museums.“It’s not the same looking at a painting in a gallery when you can feel other eyes are on you,” he shrugs and admits to toying with the idea of adopting a disguise. “Sometimes I try to sneak out when it’s dark, out in the streets, to get a taste of that freedom, to feel the vibe of the city. Other times I care less about people watching me and just go to a restaurant but that doesn’t happen that often. It’s an all-consuming job, hard to escape from and you don’t know the price you have to pay for your passion when you start out.”PSG travel to Nice on Friday night and then take on Club Brugge in the Champions League next Tuesday. Then it is Marseille on Sunday night. It is a relentless business and for someone who has been a manager for 19 years it is a demanding job that can seem never-ending.Does a person have to be slightly mad to be a manager? “Yes, you have to be,” he says with a smile. “It was pretty obvious from the start because even when you’re the coach of the under-14s or the under-15s in the academy, although you don’t have to deal with the press or the media you do have to deal with the parents and sometimes I’m not sure which is worse …“You have to deal with the pressure inside the academies, the parents who want the best for their kids and how you don’t always share the same opinions. But we’re all crazy in love with football so we accept it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/292801e3421e28ba8462ce76735b2ef13801d4b0/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c00a251effffd646991d6b0c92b14c84","title":"zombie debt benefits overpayment poverty","story":"Tens of thousands of people have received demands to repay alleged overpayments of government benefits – often decades old – plunging them into a Kafkaesque struggle against a faceless bureaucracy This is what happens when the government targets you for zombie debt collection.You receive a letter from your state’s department of human services claiming that you were “overissued” $4,132 in food stamp and cash benefits in the 1980s. Enclosed is a copy of the original overpayment notice they say they sent you when you were still listening to Madonna and Bobby Brown.You don’t remember ever seeing it before.The letter informs you that, since you didn’t respond immediately three decades ago, your 90-day window to request a fair hearing and contest the overpayment has closed. You now have a debt, and it’s past due.The state threatens to refer this debt to the United States Department of Treasury, which has the power to withhold your federal tax return, your earned income tax credit, a portion of your military retirement pay – even your social security disability check. You are barely making ends meet, so the financial loss might mean doing without meals, a utilities shutoff, or skimping on medication.If they can’t get the money from you, they will withhold your adult children’s tax returns. You read this correctly: the federal government will take your children’s money to resolve a 30-year-old alleged public benefits overpayment.You have few options if you want to avoid this: you can pay the whole balance immediately, set up a monthly payment plan, or request an administrative review. But the process is impossibly Kafkaesque: you have to send evidence that you don’t owe the debt, so you’ll need to find three-decade-old pay stubs and household expense receipts. And who can do that?If you’re lucky, you’ll eventually argue your case in front of an administrative law judge. But she’ll work for the very agency that sent you the letter.You have no right to free legal representation, so if you can’t find a legal aid or pro bono lawyer, you’re entirely on your own.With quiet but devastating regularity, zombie debt notices are arriving at the homes of tens of thousands across the US – courtesy of the government and with the assistance of heavyweight tech companies.  can reveal that predatory policy changes, turbocharged by digital innovations, are producing a wave of aggressive debt collection that stretches back decades and targets the nation’s most vulnerable.Last year, Team 3335 found out about government zombie debt first-hand. The family calls themselves “Team 3335” because that’s the address of the brick-faced single-family home in Steger, Illinois, that shelters three generations: 50-year-old Star Kaminski, her three children and the family’s matriarch, 72-year-old Dreama Richardson.When Dreama began to need more help with day-to-day chores, she and her daughter bought this modest place together, not far away from the public middle school where Star works as a librarian. It’s a little crowded, but Star sees that as a gift, not a sacrifice. She likes her family near they meet life’s joys and challenges together.Before the letter came, they were doing pretty well.Then, last September, the Illinois department of human services, or IDHS, sent Dreama a letter claiming she had been overpaid $2,500 in cash assistance and $1,632 in food stamp benefits over a period of 10 months – in 1988 and 1989.The agency alleged that Dreama failed to report teenaged Star’s income from a part-time job at Taco Bell, which pushed the household’s income over the earning cap for public assistance, making them ineligible.Every 10 years or so since then, Dreama lost a tax return to service the “debt”, but she hadn’t heard from IDHS since 2007. Now, the state was looking to recoup the final $1,323 they said the family owed.The household had 60 days to pay up, or they would withhold a portion of Dreama’s social security check – her only source of income – until the alleged overpayment was satisfied.There was, however, a problem: in 1988 and 1989, Star wasn’t living with her mom or contributing financially to her household.In the private market, a zombie debt is a debt that is past its statute of limitations, not owed, paid in full, or otherwise contested, yet which has found its way into the hands of a collection agency intent on pursuing payment by any means necessary.Those agencies are known to harass, threaten and trick consumers into paying out-of-date private debts, which they buy for pennies on the dollar. In 1977, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act was passed to protect people against the aggressive tactics collection agencies use – calling at all hours, contacting employers, deception, publishing debtors’ names – and to require that creditors prove that a debt is actually owed.Unfortunately for Team 3335, the “overpayment” they’re battling is government debt they enjoy none of these protections. If private zombie debt is surprisingly easy to kill – asking a collection agency for proof the debt exists can often make it vanish forever – government zombie debt is just the opposite, rising like a phoenix from the ashes of the most difficult times in people’s lives, over and over again.When Dreama received the letter in September 2018, she almost agreed to pay. In her 70s, beginning to suffer from memory problems, and on a fixed income, the notice frightened and confused her. “I didn’t understand,” she told me. “They explained it to me, but I still didn’t understand. How do you argue with the government? How do you prove something from 30 years ago?”Written in her spidery handwriting in the margins of the September 2018 invoice for $1,323.18 is a repayment plan suggested by an IDHS representative: “Due 15th of month,” it reads, “$25.00.”Before she wrote her first check, one of Star’s daughters found a handful of articles written by Mark Brown for the Chicago Sun-Times describing other women in their 70s and 80s receiving notices about long-overdue public assistance overpayments. Star contacted a Chicago not-for-profit that agreed to provide the family free legal aid. With their support, Dreama filed an appeal against the 1989 household composition error that created the overpayment “debt”.Dreama’s attorney submitted a number of documents supporting her case, including a signed affidavit from Star’s ex-husband attesting that she was not living with her mother when she was working for Taco Bell. The Illinois department of human services sent a casework manager to testify, but submitted no evidence.The hearing officer found for the state.Hearing officer Sheila King wrote in her decision that because Team 3335 filed their challenge more than 90 days after the “mailing of the first notice of the department’s action” back in 1989, “the Bureau of Hearings does not have jurisdiction”. She dismissed the appeal, allowing federal debt collection to move forward.If Dreama paid for a vacation with a credit card and then refused to pay, the credit card company would have to sue in order to collect. They would have to serve her with a summons and provide proof that she had received it – they couldn’t just mail a notice and assume it found its way into her hands. She could demand proof that the debt actually existed and ask to see a record of any payments already made. In Illinois, the credit card company would have 10 years to file a lawsuit to collect the debt, one of the longest statutes of limitations in the country.None of these protections applies to Dreama’s alleged public benefits overpayment. There is no proof she ever received the 1989 notice. The state offered no evidence that her “debt” was correctly calculated. They insist they can go on trying to collect it forever.To Star, it feels less like lawful debt collection and more like intimidation. “You don’t have the means to defend yourself,” she said. “They’re big bullies.”It is unclear if a legal mechanism for garnishing Dreama’s social security checks actually exists. But Team 3335 is still nervous. “We worry about how mom is going to do without her money,” says Star. “If she wasn’t living with me, I don’t know where she’d be. Without one of us, the whole deck of cards falls.”“It’s robbery,” she says, “from our most vulnerable people – our seniors. And it’s just not right.”Team 3335 is not alone. According to data obtained from the Illinois department of human services through an open records request, the agency sends out an average of 23,000 of these pre-offset notices every year.Though the department denied in 2016 that there’s been any recent push to collect old debts, attempts to recoup are clearly increasing. In 2010, IDHS sent out 7,669 notices that they were referring overpayments to Treasury. In 2017, they sent 32,881.Back in 1996, sweeping changes to the public assistance system shifted how the government views administrative error. Two new acts included provisions that redefined overpayments of any kind – whether due to agency mistakes, client error or fraudulent misrepresentation – as debt.The acts expanded state agencies’ power to collect overpayments from future benefits, unemployment compensation and federal pay, pensions or income tax refunds. They also created new collection programs, including the Treasury Offset Program, or Top.The process got a boost when, in the summer of 2008, the Farm Bill lifted the 10-year limit on collecting overpayments. That year, Top collected $3.3bn in federal non-tax debts, more than three and a half times the amount they collected a decade earlier.And then, in December 2010, the Claims Resolution Act passed. This historic piece of legislation settled an unresolved court case in favor of 75,000 black farmers unjustly denied agricultural loans in the 1980s and 1990s. Ironically, tucked into its 801st section was a provision to increase the “collection of past-due, legally enforceable state debts”. It quietly expanded which debts could be referred to Treasury, from only those due to fraud to those resulting from unintentional errors.At the same time, the Affordable Care Act of 2010 required states to consolidate and modernize their public assistance eligibility processes into streamlined, integrated digital systems.Then, in the same year, Illinois signed what would eventually be a $288m contract with the accounting and risk-management firm Deloitte to replace an older automated intake system with the Integrated Eligibility System (IES).And yet, in 2013, Top collected $46.4m in Snap and unemployment debt for the state of Illinois.So how do the tens of thousands of people Illinois department of human services accuses of receiving overpayments every year respond? Some, like 75-year-old Tim Pegues, do everything in their power to pay, even if it means skipping meals to try to make good on a debt created by the government’s mistake.Pegues went through a rough patch in the early 2000s after a relationship disintegrated. He ended up unhoused. By the time his eldest daughter found him in Indiana, he had walking pneumonia. Back in Chicago and in the hospital, a social worker helped him apply for cash assistance and food stamps, which stabilized his life. “I was doing good,” he told me in July 2019. “I got a chance to get back on my feet. I got a roof over my head. I’m being a man. That’s when I got the letter.”We sat together on red couches in the basement of his small, cheerful house on the South Side of Chicago. Pegues was relaxing under a poster featuring Malcolm X, Dr Martin Luther King Jr and Nelson Mandela shooting pool. Despite a significant disability – due to a childhood injury, one of his legs is two and a half inches shorter than the other – Pegues worked for 30 years as a truck driver and raised four children.In a panic, Pegues called and set up a payment plan: $5 on the 25th of every month. At that rate, it would take him 131 years to clear the debt. Even this modest payment was a significant loss for him. “A lot of people don’t think $5 is a lot of money,” he said. “But if you don’t have it, it’s like a million dollars. It could be a meal: a can of pork and beans, a loaf of bread.”He wrote the check every month for the next 16 years.Then, he saw Mark Brown’s articles in the Chicago Sun-Times and came to the same conclusion as Star and her family: he wasn’t alone. “Come to find out that there’s maybe hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. “Sounds like somebody got their hand in the cookie jar.” An email from Brown to IDHS triggered a review of Pegues’s case at the agency, and a few days later, he received a letter from the Bureau of Collections thanking him for his $5 payment in March 2018 and informing him that it was too late to appeal against the overpayment decision.“Your only recourse,” the letter read, underlining the point for emphasis, “is to provide us with documentation to substantiate that your claims are not past due andor legally enforceable or present your case to the circuit court.”The letter concluded with a line Pegues interpreted as a veiled threat: “We will continue to accept your monthly payments. However, the agency will not accept your $5.00 payments as an official payment plan.” He was asked to call the office to “establish a repayment plan which will fit your financial situation” in order to avoid “future involuntary withholds as well as other collection action by the department of human services”. He called a lawyer instead.With the attorney’s support, Pegues decided to stop paying the overpayment bill. He wrote his last check in June 2019. “The debt is still here,” he told me a few weeks later. “This’ll be the first month I don’t give them a dime.” I asked him how it felt to not write the check. “Good,” he said. “But I’ve been worried if they try to take my house away from me. I’m taking a chance, gambling. There’s a possibility that I could lose everything. It would be a shame for something I didn’t do.”This is what puzzles Pegues most – why is he being held responsible for paying back an overpayment that the state admits is their fault? “The thing that I find is funny is that they told me what I was getting,” he said. “I didn’t pick it.” He had to be recertified as eligible to continue receiving benefits every six months. Each time the agency evaluated his case, they continued granting him benefits. “They kept on re-evaluating me, but they kept sending me money. Then I got that letter that I owe them $7,500.”“You’re just barely swimming, and they put more water on you. And then they hand you a weight. It’s devastating. I’m 75, about to be 76, and the fights I’ve had wore me down. I’m tired. They keep saying you’re in the golden years, but I ain’t found no gold.”It’s hard for a reasonable person to see the point in a government agency harassing an elderly man for $5 a month. After the cost of billing and postage, appeals and case management, Illinois is losing money collecting from people like Pegues. That’s why state and federal governments are looking to new economies of scale offered by advances in predictive analytics.Technology companies – including industry heavyweights such as IBM, Oracle and Lexis Nexis – promise to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to change the fraud detection paradigm. In general, safety net programs operate on a “pay and audit” system, releasing benefits and then ferreting out the ineligible or dishonest with frequent interviews and recertifications.The new systems promise instead to predict fraud before payment occurs.For example, Pondera Solutions, a company based in Fulton, California, says it can search massive public and private databases, comb through social media and use proprietary (and secret) predictive models to rank every single applicant to a government program “based on their risk for fraud”.In Illinois, increases in government zombie debt recoupment follow technological shifts as well as policy changes. After the 2013 peak in collections, returns declined: Top collected $133.3m that year, but only $101.2m in 2017. But collections began to increase again in 2018, after IDHS rolled out a major technology enhancement to the Integrated Eligibility System in October 2017.For applicants, the upgrade has been plagued with problems. Tens of thousands of families didn’t receive their Snap benefits during that holiday season. By June 2018, the system had a backlog of 15,000 nursing home residents waiting for Medicaid eligibility decisions.While digital eligibility is a nightmare for public assistance applicants, it has been great at chasing down dormant debts.Andrew Dorliae, 44, lives in north-west Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in a neighborhood full of window tinting shops and Mexican restaurants. On his door is a sign that reads: “Trust in the Lord with all your heart.”Before starting a home tax preparation business, Dorliae, a Liberian immigrant, was employed by Whirlpool Corporation, working his way up from assembler on a production line making refrigerators to inspector first class. In 2017, he took a $5-an-hour pay cut, from $21.43 to $17.40, to secure a weekend shift – 5am to 5pm every Friday, Saturday and Sunday – that allowed him to be at home with his children at night and to go to school during the week.But in early 2018, Whirlpool closed the weekend shift. The company offered him a five-day-a-week overnight shift instead: midnight to 7am, Monday through Friday. Dorliae told his employer of more than six years that there was no way he could fill this shift: his wife also worked overnights and his daughter had a health condition requiring night-time care.In March, he received notice from Whirlpool: he had been terminated. He applied for unemployment insurance benefits with Iowa workforce development (IWD) on 5 April, was found eligible, and received $490 each week in May. Then, Whirlpool challenged Dorliae’s initial unemployment eligibility, contesting their responsibility to pay a portion of his benefits. On 11 June, IWD conducted a fact-finding investigation that reversed the earlier eligibility decision, finding that Dorliae voluntarily left Whirlpool “without good cause attributable to the employer”.In an instant, Dorliae was found ineligible for benefits he had already received.In the end, Dorliae won his battle with Iowa workforce development and his “debt” was not referred to Treasury. “I appealed every decision they made,” he told me, gesturing towards an inch-high stack of correspondence sitting on the desk in his tiny home office, a meticulous record of his battle with the agency.He firmly denies that he quit his job at Whirlpool. “They offered me a shift which I could not do,” he said. “I didn’t quit. My job let me down after all these years. You must survive until you get back on your feet. That’s what unemployment is for.”Dorliae understands IWD’s need to investigate applicants and pursue those who might take advantage of the system. But he is puzzled why the burden of proof that they do not owe Iowa an overpayment debt should fall entirely on applicants, who have no right to free legal representation and must navigate a confusing appeal system alone.“I applied for unemployment. You give it to me,” he explained. “Then, after the fact-finding, you tell me I owe. It doesn’t seem fair.” Giving back money you’ve already spent can be impossible for families with few financial reserves. Many low-income families plan their whole financial year around a tax refund. Losing it means not being able to fix the used car that gets you to work, no investment in education for the kids, not fixing the leaky roof or broken hot water heater. It is as if the agency is trying to take food back out of your children’s mouths, or, as Dorliae put it: “You owe what you have eaten.”Despite Dorliae’s faith in the process, these are extraordinarily complex proceedings. His case was actually four cases occurring simultaneously. Dorliae had to keep track of each administrative law proceeding meet deadlines for timely appeal provide evidence of school schedules, commute times, medical conditions and communication with his employer and attend near-constant telephone hearings. All for unemployment benefits totaling less than $3,000.Dorliae is a paradigmatic tax professional: organized, detail-oriented, smart and confident in his ability to navigate mazes of legal and bureaucratic red tape. He did everything right, and he prevailed. But he is the exception and not the rule. Others I spoke to, like Kevin Christopherson of St Donatus, grew so frustrated and fearful that they just gave up.Like Dorliae, Christopherson originally received unemployment benefits. An initial fact-finding confirmed his eligibility. Then his employer appealed and IWD reversed the eligibility decision. To Christopherson, launching another appeal seemed like an insurmountable hurdle. “It just seemed like they were all against me,” he told me in July 2019. “My mental state was really eating away at me. So I just forget about it.” Now he owes the state an “overpayment” of $2,275.According to information gathered through an open records request, Iowa workforce development is currently using software provided by Lexis Nexis and Pondera to identify and pursue debts like Kevin Christopherson’s. For example, in late 2018, IWD ran the Pondera software to identify potential overpayments, and in October and November, sent out 20,000 “intent to offset” notices threatening to turn the debt over to Treasury for collection. Troublingly, in its contract with Iowa workforce development, Pondera characterizes “improper payments”, like Christopherson’s , as fraud.The license for the Pondera software costs the Iowa workforce development $697,833.33 a year. Pondera also has claimed sizeable contracts in California, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, and reported in 2016 that it had doubled its revenues several years in a row.Andrew Dorliae fought the system and won. But was it a fair fight? Think of Team 3335. Imagine Dreama without her daughter’s help. Even with Star and an attorney in her corner, the possibility of Dreama’s social security check being garnished still looms. And what about Tim, who fears that any day they could come for his home?For poor and working-class families, the financial burden of government zombie debt is potentially life-shattering. “If we want to stop evictions, we need to start paying attention to debt recoupment,” Alex Kornya, litigation director and general counsel at Iowa Legal Aid, told me. “The types of debts that tend to be the cause of evictions – perhaps more often than private consumer debts – are government debts, because the government can do more to you. They can cut more deeply into the reserves that you have to have to be self-sufficient.”Representatives from the Department of Treasury and Iowa workforce development insist that the decision to enforce delinquent debt collection is a statutory mandate. “Once an agency certifies a debt,” a spokesperson from the Department of Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service wrote in an 11 October email, “the Fiscal Service is required by law to collect it.” Nicholas Olivencia, legal council for Iowa workforce development, wrote that “IWD, as well as every state, is required under Federal law to participate and enforce the Treasury Offset Program”. The Illinois department of human services did not immediately respond to a request for comment.But agencies have more options than Olivencia suggests. The federal rules allow them to waive offset collection where it would cause economic distress. In fact, New Hampshire has done just this – in 2013, the state added a procedure to their administrative code so that iniduals can request forbearance if a proposed tax refund offset will cause extreme financial hardship.The fear that predatory debt collection produces is especially acute when the creditor is the government. It’s easy to feel like there is no remedy, no refuge, no neutral third party to whom you can appeal. That fear is amplified when your accuser is faceless and invisible, a few lines of computer code or a robot voice on the phone. Government zombie debt shifts responsibility for correcting systemic administrative incompetence on to the shoulders of our country’s most vulnerable people.A people who feel preyed upon by government will not trust government. Those burned by predatory government debt collection will hesitate to use public services again, even when they are eligible and need agency resources to stay safe and healthy. This is not a negligible revenue gain it is a debt we are accruing against our greatest national wealth, our people. And it is fast compounding interest.This article was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project.If you have been targeted for government zombie debt collection, or you have other information about it, tell your story via secure email to: virginiaeubanks@protonmail"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86b06f6357c0e3e2a47aa62627755037d1475e00/0_0_3329_1997/master/3329.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b9b01c15da153d58dfcfc9ba780e909","title":"what is the truth about vaping","story":"Jamie Doward and Max Sanderson join Anushka Asthana to navigate a way through the haze of the debate around vaping.

He advised the EU capitals he would announce on Wednesday whether negotiations on an agreement would have to continue into next week.Barnier warned that the starting point for a deal has to be the Northern Ireland-only backstop, keeping it in the EU’s single market for goods and erecting a customs border in the Irish Sea, a proposal previously rejected by Theresa May.During a phone call with Johnson on Tuesday, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, acknowledged the momentum towards reaching a deal but raised the possible need for a “technical” Brexit extension beyond 31 October to allow talks to bear fruit.The EU is insisting the leaders will not negotiate when they meet. “The European council will be a political moment to tell the story, not to make detailed technical negotiations,” said one French official. “It cannot be a catch-up. We do not do things urgently.”German government officials conceded reaching a deal this week was an ambitious target and agreeing on the technical issues could require another two months of talks. The thorny issue of how to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland continues to dog the negotiations. The UK has accepted that Northern Ireland will remain in the EU’s single market for goods although it is seeking to find a way to time-limit the arrangement through a consent mechanism for Stormont.Barnier told ministers that the UK had dropped the original Stormont lock idea tabled by the prime minister on 1 October, which would have in effect given the Democratic Unionist party a veto on arrangements for avoiding a hard border coming into force and staying in force. Fresh ideas are being discussed, he said.The problem of a customs border remained difficult, Barnier told the ministers. Downing Street last week accepted there would not be a border on the island of Ireland but the government has also been seeking a way to avoid one in the Irish Sea on the basis that it would represent an economic dislocation of the country.The EU has rejected the UK’s proposal of a dual system at Northern Ireland’s ports and airport that would involve tracking goods entering from Great Britain and applying differential treatment depending on their final destination.Barnier has instead pushed the UK to accept a model closer to a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Under one proposal under discussion, Northern Ireland would not be part of the EU’s customs territory, but the bloc’s full customs code would have to be enforced in the Irish Sea. “Northern Ireland would de jure be in the UK’s customs territory but de facto in the European union’s”, said an EU source.Ireland’s deputy prime minister, Simon Coveney, said a deal required a “big step forward” from Downing Street. “This is difficult but it is possible”, he added.The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, who was also in Luxembourg and briefly met Barnier on Tuesday morning, insisted a deal was “still very possible”. “The talks are ongoing”, he said. “We need to give them space to proceed but detailed conversations are under way.”Speaking before the meeting with ministers, Barnier told reporters: “Our teams are working hard and the work just starts now, today.“This work has been intense all over the weekend and yesterday, because even if the agreement will be difficult, more and more difficult to be frank, it is still possible this week – reaching an agreement is still possible, obviously any agreement must work for everyone, the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Let me add that it is also high time to turn good intentions into a legal text.”France’s EU minister, Amélie de Montchalin, raised the prospect of a Brexit extension beyond 31 October as she arrived in Luxembourg.She said: “Time alone is not a solution. However, if a significant political change takes place in the UK then that could potentially justify a discussion on an extension if we were asked for it.“A significant political change is the prospect of an election, a referendum, something that changes the political dynamic so that the triangle between the government, parliament and the British people could align with each other a bit more. We believe that time alone will not solve the complexity of what is at stake.”“I’m not quite sure if a deal is close but we are trying to do our utmost best to find such a good deal because a hard Brexit would be a disaster not just for the UK but also for the EU27,” said Germany’s EU affairs minister, Michael Roth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d1b282255ce5d274a71eaf08bb06bbac570b36/0_900_2082_1249/master/2082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=523cde0ca315990fb4d0032cd3456672","title":"home office reverses visa decision for egyptian gp","story":"Dr Wesam Hassan had been told that son would not be granted visa to live with her in UKThe Home Office has reversed its decision to ban the son of an academic at Oxford University from living with her in the UK.Dr Wesam Hassan, a GP from Egypt who has just started a PhD at Oxford, learned in August that her nine-year-old son would not be granted a visa to live with her in the UK.The Home Office ignored the fact that Hassan’s husband is currently a humanitarian coordinator for the UN in Yemen, which is designated a “non family station” because of the conflict there.Having been shut out of the UK, the boy is currently living with his aunt in Egypt. Hassan says the separation has caused the family “real trauma”.However, after the  contacted the Home Office last week they reopened her case. They confirmed on Tuesday that they have reversed their decision and Hassan’s son will now be granted a dependent child visa to live with her in Oxford.Hassan said: “We can’t quite believe it yet. I had a video call with my son last night and he kept saying ‘Are you sure? Can we trust them?’”Under the Home Office’s immigration rules a child may only be given a visa if both parents are living in the UK, unless the parent living here has sole responsibility. Hassan had supplied letters from the UN explaining her husband could not have family living with him. Yet her son’s rejection letter concluded that there were no exceptional circumstances.Hassan is now calling for the Home Office to meet families like hers for an interview before they make decisions to keep them apart.“If they really want to protect the wellbeing of the child they need to take a more human approach,” she says. “I am so grateful for the role of the media in allowing cases like mine to be brought to life, but many more mothers don’t have the privilege of being heard.”Hassan’s case has fuelled a growing tide of anger amongst academics, who say the Home Office’s immigration rules are making it difficult for talented researchers from across the world to forge an academic career in the UK.Two weeks ago Education  revealed that the Home Office had refused visas to the four-year-old and nine-year-old daughters of another Oxford academic, Prof Amber Murrey. Murrey, who is an American expert in human geography, is now appealing their decision.The Home Office is currently preparing to deport Dr Furaha Asani, an academic based at Leicester University, to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Although Asani’s father was from the DRC she has never been to the country, where the Home Office agrees sexual violence is pervasive.The Home Office said: “We welcome international academics and recognise their contribution to the UK’s world-leading education sector.“All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the immigration rules.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/758025ea847bcf3104e0940023ebcaeca02c8fc1/0_261_5281_3169/master/5281.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d71d986ac3d6dd3408cb3b9e4c8a0aad","title":"michel barnier midnight ultimatum uk what happens now","story":"Boris Johnson has until the end of Tuesday to make the concession needed for a dealBy Wednesday afternoon, it will be clear whether Boris Johnson has a deal to put to parliament on its “super Saturday” sitting or not. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, will inform members  whether the prime minister has conceded enough on the Irish border for there to be a draft treaty to present to leaders when they hold a summit on Thursday.The prime minister has made a series of major U-turns in recent weeks. That gives EU officials some hope he will continue in this vein. A final push has been demanded by Barnier. If Downing Street thinks it is a step too far, and reverts to the bellicose language of Johnson’s senior aide, Dominic Cummings, then all bets are off.Barnier has said the UK needs to table legal text, and it needs to be based on the February 2018 Northern Ireland-only backstop. That proposal – rejected by Theresa May as a constitutional outrage that no British prime minister could accept – would keep Northern Ireland in the single market for goods and the EU’s customs territory. The arrangement would cease to be in force if a future trade deal offered an alternative solution for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.Barnier is open to tweaking that model, however. A consent mechanism, under which Stormont has a say over alignment with the EU, is being negotiated. It has also been suggested that Northern Ireland could de jure remain in the UK’s customs territory rather than the European Union’s. Barnier is insistent that, de facto, the EU’s full customs code needs to be applied to goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland.A similar deal was blown up by the Democratic Unionist party and the Brexiter MPs in the European Research Group in 2018 but both seem to be giving Johnson more leeway than they afforded Theresa May. The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, was in Downing Street on Monday evening for 90 minutes. Any arrangement that creates checks and controls, and potentially a tariff border between Britain and Northern Ireland, is likely to be problematic. But the UK could establish a rebate system to ensure businesses in Northern Ireland are not financially disadvantaged. They could also arguably claim that the UK, “whole and entire”, would leave the EU’s customs territory.There are two possibilities: deadlock if Johnson decides to walk out on the summit and attacks Brussels for intransigence, or further negotiations to talk around the problem next week. The latter would open up the possibility of a second EU summit, perhaps on 29 October, for a potential deal to be signed off by leaders. A Brexit extension beyond 31 October is inevitable either way.For all the noise from Downing Street, Johnson has been a pliant negotiator with Brussels in recent days. There is some evidence that he now wants to put a deal to parliament on 19 October, come what may. But if the last three years of Brexit have taught us anything it is that fudge, delay and prevarication are always the most likely course. Berlin and France do not want to rush. Talks may well continue past this week."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88fe5276da073d4b9647bbfbe4471c08f33934e6/526_455_4116_2470/master/4116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1dfe9276d6a622ab0a9b34ce4eca45","title":"the votes are now there for brexit deal says jacob rees mogg","story":"Commons leader claims MPs will back deal even though PM is yet to get agreement with EUJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, has claimed “the votes are now there” for Boris Johnson to pass a Brexit deal through parliament.Rees-Mogg, a close ally of Johnson, who is responsible for legislation in the Commons, made the bold claim on LBC Radio, despite the fact the prime minister is yet to secure a deal with Brussels.To win a vote, the prime minister would need the support of almost all Eurosceptics in the Conservative party, as well as most of the former Tories from whom he withdrew the whip and either the DUP or a bloc of Labour MPs.Johnson is edging closer to the number he needs, with more prominent Eurosceptics now on board with his plans. However, the DUP, which has reservations over plans to leave Northern Ireland in close alignment with the EU, has still not publicly declared its backing.Labour MPs will need reassurances about workers’ rights, environmental protections and the future relationship – and will come under pressure from their party not to vote with the government.Despite the fact that Theresa May’s deal was rejected three times by the House of Commons, Rees-Mogg said: “If a deal is agreed with the European Union, it will get through, in my view, the House of Commons because everybody’s desperate to finish this.”Shedding more light on the process, he said: “We’ve been doing this for three-and-a-half years it can’t go on forever. We are near a conclusion and parliament, once it’s agreed something, can legislate very quickly. So, if the meaningful vote goes through, then the legislation will merely be the ratification in domestic law of the treaty and that, I think, is a relatively easy bill to pass if, if there is a deal.”He claimed some “big changes” have happened since May failed to get her deal with the EU through parliament, including a shift in the mood towards getting Brexit done and Brussels agreeing to reopen the withdrawal agreement.However, Amber Rudd, the former cabinet minister who resigned over Johnson’s lack of progress towards a deal, said she thought there was a “whiff of sexism” about Eurosceptics in the European Research Group potentially being prepared to vote for the prime minister’s deal and not May’s agreement.She told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Emma Barnet: “It is difficult to fillet it out, how much is about a more trusting relationship that they clearly have with Boris Johnson, because he himself was very much part of that ERG group in terms of wanting a harder Brexit than the former prime minister wanted, but I do feel as a woman who’s active in politics myself, that there is a whiff of sexism, as you put it, as well.”When asked why Conservative MPs could vote for a potential Johnson deal, when they rejected May’s deal, Rudd said: “There are certain behaviours that particularly men in politics want to see, that women don’t so much, that Boris did adopt, which has given the ERG members a lot of confidence.“So, for instance, I was very opposed to the prime minister expelling 21 colleagues from the party as MPs, and I felt very strongly that Ken Clarke, who had been in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet, should have a place in Boris Johnson’s party.“But he took a different view, and I thought that was a very aggressive thing to do, and unnecessary, and has had the effect of radicalising the 21 – which I have now joined. So that sort of aggressive behaviour, though, may be the sort of thing that a group of ERG men, particularly, wanted to see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05184bcda21127d611feb5254b14390e827f9812/0_25_2355_1413/master/2355.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071ce96fc2d364e96fe5907e1622b3df","title":"2019 earth science week photo competition winners","story":"The Geological Society has announced the winners of this year’s competition, which for the first time allowed in images taken from around the world.

Sue George helps her find out more than she imaginedWhen you start researching your family tree, you never know what you might find. Sophie Morgan – TV presenter and campaigner – knew very little about her family’s dark past.“We knew a few things about my mother’s side,” she says, “but nothing about my father’s.”As I delve into Morgan’s dad’s side of the family, using Ancestry, I’m soon introduced to someone whose life was punctuated with multiple marriages, domestic violence and even a proposed suicide pact.The life of John Andrew Towle (JAT senior), Morgan’s great-great-grandfather, not only highlights the absence of contraception in the 19th century and the infancy of modern medicine, but also the lack of women’s rights.JAT senior was born in Salford in 1826 and began his working life as a pawnbroker, like his father before him. JAT senior must have been energetic and ambitious, as he later became an engineer, while remaining a pawnbroker.He was married three times, the first two of which were to women who lived near him in the lively Broughton Road shopping district. His first marriage, to Catherine Dixon, took place in 1855.His second marriage, to Morgan’s two-times great-grandmother Mary Ann, took place in Paris in 1867. They went on to have six children together in the seven years they were married. Mary Ann died in 1874, around the same time their final – and her 10th – child, Octavia Ventnor Towle, was born.But it was his third marriage that was the most tumultuous. JAT senior married Jane Dunster Holliday in June 1875. But they soon went their separate ways. In her orce petition, dated August 1876, she states that he harmed her physically six weeks after their marriage, when he bruised her arm and tried to “pitch her out of the window”. Soon afterwards, he suggested that they take poison together. The litany of cruelty continued until January 1876. She finally left him after he violently pushed her and “hit her with severe blows, feeling the effects of it for some time”.At that time, orce was both unusual and expensive. The grounds for women to orce their husbands were fewer than those for men and their wives women had to prove cruelty, whereas for men, adultery on the part of their wife was sufficient.JAT senior didn’t marry again after the orce. He lived until 1914, dying aged 88.Many of his children, including Octavia, didn’t marry. Morgan’s great-grandfather, also called John Andrew Towle, finally married at the age of 49, and had his only child three years later.Unsurprisingly, Morgan was shocked to find out about her ancestor’s past. “We are uncovering a secret life, a dark side we didn’t know about, which is intriguing,” she says. “Clearly he was a very dodgy character. I wonder how the rest of the family will react? When you find out something you don’t like, how do you feel?”Meanwhile, Morgan’s mother’s side had their fair share of scandal too – from illegitimacy to fraudulent marriage certificates.Ancestry reveals that several branches of her mother’s line came from the Scottish Borders between Jedburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed. Morgan’s great-grandmother, Ann Drummond Ferguson, lived and died in Scotland. Ann was born in August 1886 the word “illegitimate” was marked clearly on her birth certificate. However, when her mother, Agnes, married her father, John Ferguson, six months later, Ann’s birth certificate was amended to show her legitimacy.However, the illegitimacy wouldn’t have been the only thing raising eyebrows. Agnes was 30 when she gave birth to Ann, while John was just 18 – having been 17 when Ann was conceived. John clearly felt the strain of going against societal norms, as he lied about his age on the marriage certificate, listing himself as 21 when he was still 18, while Agnes, who by then was 31, said she was 30.They married in the manse (the minister’s house), rather than in church. This implies that they had a small wedding, which was quite normal because the couple were not well off.Their marriage endured, and they had another six children. However, a new family mystery emerges around Eliza Taylor Drummond – born illegitimate to Agnes two years before Ann, and not John’s child. Eliza was part of their household until 1901, but there is no trace of her after that.Finding out about her mother’s roots in Scotland made Morgan keen to visit the part of the country where her ancestors were based. “I love the idea that there’s this woman in the family who married a much younger man,” she says.The whole experience has made Morgan determined to keep searching for answers about her family’s past.“I’m so curious to take it further,” she says. “I want to go further back, and I’d like to find living relatives.”Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

But concerns have been raised about privacy and data security, the ability of council officials to understand how some of the systems work, and the difficulty for citizens in challenging automated decisions.It has emerged North Tyneside council has dropped TransUnion, whose system it used to check housing and council tax benefit claims. Welfare payments to an unknown number of people were wrongly delayed when the computer’s “predictive analytics” erroneously identified low-risk claims as high risk.Meanwhile, Hackney council in east London has dropped Xantura, another company, from a project to predict child abuse and intervene before it happens, saying it did not deliver the expected benefits. And Sunderland city council has not renewed a £4.5m data analytics contract for an “intelligence hub” provided by Palantir.A spokesperson for the Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: “Good use of data can be hugely beneficial in helping councils make services more targeted and effective … But it is important to note that data is only ever used to inform decisions and not make decisions for councils.”But Silkie Carlo, the director of the campaign group Big Brother Watch, said the increasing use of algorithms was leaving vulnerable people at the whim of “automated decisions … they have no idea about and can’t challenge”.Gwilym Morris, a management consultant who works with IT providers to the public sector, said the complexity of the systems meant the leadership of local authorities “don’t really understand what is going on” and this raised questions about how citizens’ data was used.A council report concluded: “TransUnion provides no reason for a case meeting a high-risk category and it was found that in most cases, the reason for it being high risk could not be established … There was no reason for the payment to be withheld, but claims had been delayed.”A spokesperson for TransUnion said the classification of risk groups was “ultimately a matter for the local authorities to decide”.They added: “Each local authority also determines what extra checks are required for claimants falling into any particular category, and can monitor for accuracy so that they can adapt their criteria if necessary.“The time spent on reviewing ‘high-risk’ claims will equally depend on each local authority’s own policy in terms of processing the additional checks.”TransUnion said it checked benefit claims for fraud for about 70 local authorities in the UK, and Xantura serves the same number of councils. The combined figure does not include other examples of algorithms found by the Data Justice Lab at Cardiff University.Sunderland council awarded a contract for a new “intelligence hub” to Palantir in 2014 as part of a plan to make efficiency savings. Last year, it was announced the authority faces a budget gap of about £50m over the next three years.The hub was used to analyse data to help with the Troubled Families programme, to bring together information on those at risk of sexual exploitation, and to help find areas at risk of flooding. The council said it did not hold a review of the project and did not know how much had been saved.A council spokesperson said it was always the authority’s intention not to renew the contract and Palantir had worked alongside staff to transfer knowledge so the council would become “self-sufficient”.Hackney council said “issues of variable data quality meant that the system wasn’t able to provide sufficiently useful insights”.The Xantura predictive model analyses warning signs about a household, such as a child being expelled from school or a report of domestic violence. The model’s prediction is then passed to a social worker for potential action.Wajid Shafiq, the chief executive of Xantura, said: “We’re improving the accuracy of our analytics and models continuously but we have never been unable to develop a reliable predictive model.“There are a number in place right now, adding real value. Not being able to access regular updates of source data to drive the model is a bigger issue – if we don’t get regular feeds, we can’t provide an up-to-date picture of risk factors.”Simon Burall, a senior associate with the public participation charity Involve, said: “There are never just benefits from these things but risks and harms, namely privacy and data security.“But also potential wider unintended consequences, including the stigmatisation of communities and unwanted intrusion by particular services. Any benefits must be balanced against those potential risks.”David Spiegelhalter, a former president of the Royal Statistical Society, said: “There is too much hype and mystery surrounding machine learning and algorithms. I feel that councils should demand trustworthy and transparent explanations of how any system works, why it comes to specific conclusions about iniduals, whether it is fair, and whether it will actually help in practice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5d7c1484217467c0b79055c90646a4d4a04ebf72/0_90_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b0b4cf15ffb865a7ab18024d7ff3e68","title":"faster higher stronger cleaner british athletes coached in washing hands tokyo 2020","story":"British athletes will be taught how to wash their hands properly before Tokyo 2020, as hygiene becomes a new frontier in the hunt for marginal gains.The English Institute of Sport is to recommend that athletes use SureWash, an online training programme used by professionals in the NHS, before the Olympic and Paralympic Games next year. It follows long-term research which has found respiratory illness – including coughs and colds – to be the primary cause of lost training days among elite athletes.“We are working with the vast majority of Olympic and Paralympic sports on effective handwashing techniques in preparation for the Tokyo Games, which includes tools such as the SureWash training system and UV light boxes,” said Craig Ranson, director of athlete health at the EIS. “This is hugely important given that respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses are two of the biggest health threats to athlete availability for preparation and performance.”Funded by UK Sport, the EIS is based at Loughborough University, but pairs with academics from around the country in research that includes everything from biomechanics to finding the perfect amount of flex in canoeing paddles.The Athlete Respiratory Health initiative is a partnership between the EIS and Imperial College London set up last year in response to data showing that as many as 5,800 days of training were lost to respiratory illness in the two-year period to 20 July 2017. The aim has been to treat respiratory illness as if it were any other sporting injury.Dr James Hull, consultant respiratory physician at the Royal Brompton hospital and one of the initiative’s lead researchers, said: “When you look at all the athletes that travel to the Games and the problems that really scupper their chances or give them problems, nearly always top of the list are respiratory tract problems with infection at the top. So if you think about the strategies around what you might term as marginal gains, clearly you want to remove anything that might cause problems for them.“It’s akin to thinking about injury where you might use things like special shoes to reduce impact. We want to get better at trying to detect those who are at risk of respiratory problems and then to try and reduce that risk.”This includes identifying potential triggers, such as sleep deprivation and psychological stress, while also mitigating the risks brought about by tasks athletes cannot avoid, such as travelling in confined spaces and shaking the hands of any number of strangers.“We spent a lot of time thinking about how we can reduce exposure,” Hull said on Tuesday on what is, in fact, global handwashing day. “It sounds relatively easy to say it but essentially most people don’t know how to wash their hands properly. Given the fact that most respiratory viruses are exposed and then shared through contact, it’s vitally important.“There is a system called SureWash which trains you electronically. You follow video and you have to go through the WHO hand-washing stages and it marks you on your ability to conduct those and it trains you. We’re then able to assess the athletes to see if they are able to recall the stages and then be effective in remembering it.”According to Hull, it is not necessarily that people do not know how to wash their hands properly, but that they quickly forget. “We’ve done some work that shows people’s recollection of how to wash their hands is actually very poor,” he said.“Within a two‑week period you can hardly remember at all how to go through the stages. The other thing is that people are fairly unaware that the alcohol gels need a contact time of a minute. If you spray it on your hand and rub it off within 15 seconds it’s not really been effective.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd1d0ba768a9b9aeef8bc75417548ef8e792135f/98_502_2889_1734/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6233ce4c7fc2e462e30b4b152ad457f","title":"ireland all blacks rugby world cup quarter final","story":"Preparing to face New Zealand tends to keep defence coaches up all night. Since the last World Cup, the holders have scored 267 tries in 49 Tests, armed with attacking invention only Japan are able to rival.The All Blacks have failed to score a try in only two of those games, against the 2017 British \u0026amp Irish Lions in the second Test and in Dublin last November when Ireland defeated them 16-9. The common denominator was Ireland’s Andy Farrell, the defence coach jettisoned by England after the 2015 World Cup, who is again plotting the downfall this weekend of a side last defeated at a Rugby World Cup in the 2007 quarter-final against France.“I don’t know, you will have to ask him,” said the All Blacks attack coach, Ian Foster, when asked how Farrell managed to find ways of stalling New Zealand’s turbo-charged engine. “He does a job based on what he sees and so do we. We are assuming based on past behaviour that they will come up with a plan that they think is good enough to beat us. Will that involve some special plays? Probably.”Make that definitely. “We have some new stuff that we have not done before,” the Ireland prop Cian Healy said. “We have beaten them a couple of times in the last few years but this is a World Cup quarter-final. It is different.” Asked if it was the biggest match of his career, he replied: “Definitely. It is a do-or-die game. We all understand that.”It took Ireland 111 years to defeat the All Blacks but they have won two of their past three Tests against a side aiming to win a third successive World Cup. Their coach, Joe Schmidt, who is standing down after the tournament, came up with a set-piece play last November that the New Zealander had borrowed from the All Blacks and does not want this phase of his career to be ended by his compatriots.“I am sure Ireland will be primed and ready,” Foster said. “We were beaten by a good team last November, but that was a different time, a different place. Is it relevant? We don’t get stuck in the past: it is more about the excitement of the challenges in front of us. This is a week we have been preparing for a long time. It is where you really test yourself.”Ireland suffered a blow this week when their centre Bundee Aki was suspended for three weeks after being sent off last week against Samoa for a high tackle. They are waiting for the written report from the disciplinary panel before deciding whether to appeal, but on past precedent this tournament their chance of success would be remote.“Bundee is nowhere near a dirty player and he was upset about the decision, rightfully so,” said the Ireland forwards coach, Simon Easterby. “Until we have seen the report and know how the panel came to that decision, we cannot make any further comment while preparing for the match on the basis that he will to be available.”Easterby said that the key to success in their first World Cup meeting against New Zealand since 1995, when Jonah Lomu announced himself on the world stage with two tries in Johannesburg, would again be defence against a side adept at the counter-attack that is averaging 5.4 tries a match in the last four years.“We will need to be on the money without the ball,” said Easterby. “They have so many threats across the park that you cannot switch off for a minute. We cannot afford to give them any soft turnover opportunities and will have to be fully on our game.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85e8885b1f3ceba389200c9a4e7097a9b68d1fbc/0_0_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdbc12ad20b5ad0d5de8bcaab8055c77","title":"mountain climbers 2020 tour de france toughest chris froome","story":"Route described as ‘the toughest’ by Chris Froome as race organisers plan to use all the mountain ranges and include only one time trialThe Tour de France’s search for novelty and excitement in recent years has taken it in one direction: hillier, shorter, more intense, with occasional ventures off the Tarmac. The 2020 route heads down that road at breakneck speed, with only one time trial – and that up a severe climb – only one stage over 200 kilometres, and so many climbs that they risk becoming interchangeable, a blur of constant action.“The toughest Tour I’ve ever seen,” said Chris Froome, who hopes to return from a severe crash to try for his fifth title, as long as his teammate Egan Bernal does not snatch the leadership of Ineos from him. The toughness comes not so much in the actual volume of climbing – there are relatively few classic set-piece ascents in the Alps and Pyrenees, no Mont Ventoux, no Alpe d’Huez – but in the constant day-to-day intensity that will make it virtually impossible for the race to settle down. “It’s more a mid-mountain all‑rounder route. I don’t think that makes it more difficult to control,” said Froome’s boss, Dave Brailsford.That is what television demands in the 21st century, and in 2020 it will leave relatively thin pickings for the sprinters, and even less for cycling fans in the northern half of France. But the upside of an almost totally “southern” Tour is that the organisers can use all the mountain ranges of France to the full, beginning in the southern Alps on day two for what promises to be the toughest ever stage on a Tour’s opening weekend.As is now the case in the Vuelta a España, the climbs then hit the riders like a series of straight lefts and rights to the solar plexus. Heading east-west: Orcières-Merlette in the Alps, Mont Aigoual in the Massif Central, and then the Pyrenees with Loudenvielle and Laruns, the latter concluded over the super-steep Col de Marie-Blanque. Added to day two’s climbs that will make for arguably the hardest opening nine days the Tour has ever known.A brief flirtation with the flat – but possibly with the wind to fray the nerves on the Atlantic coast, then east again for a second dose of the Massif Central, including another uphill finish on the Puy Mary, a punchy finish in Lyon and a final week in the Alps. Here the novelties come with bewildering pace: three climbs of the same ridge, the Grand Colombier the toughest finish of the race on the traffic free Col de la Loze at 2,300m, and the gravel Plateau des Glières close enough to the finish at La Roche-sur-Foron for any puncture or crash potentially to decide the race.After which, there is a transfer north for the only time trial, to La Planche des Belles Filles, where there is a surprise: the organisers have not gone the whole hog and included the final gravel section, preferring the safe option of the “conventional” finish where Froome won in 2012. Overall, it is a route that will call for teams stuffed with climbers such as can be fielded only by the bigger-budget squads such as Froome and Bernal’s Ineos and Primoz Roglic’s Jumbo.It will also have a wealth of openings for a rider who is not a climbing specialist but who can compete from day to day through sheer panache and racing ability, such as the nation’s new darling Julian Alaphilippe. The volume of climbing will suit France’s other star of 2019, Thibaut Pinot, although the day-to-day intensity will fray his nerves. The final time trial starts in Pinot’s hometown and finishes in his backyard, but it is a route made for the 2019 winner Bernal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62f798698e0c164ab37e29d946f787c4160ff33e/0_213_4439_2663/master/4439.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5618295630685adbe6e52a72578abe29","title":"simone biles gymnastics world championships medals record","story":"The record-smashing American has learned how to truly enjoy competing against herself, and now she too can marvel at her greatness as it unfoldsIn possibly the final performance of her world championships career, Simone Biles stepped up to the floor on Sunday and prepared to open her routine with the skill that has become one of the most memorable sights in sport.Showcasing her triple twisting-double, the Biles II, she flew high into the sky, her legs tightly tucked as she twisted in the air. When she landed with her chest upright and just a small hop, her face burst into a wide smile that illuminated the rest of her gold-medal floor routine.Biles’ 25th world championship gold medal extended her lead as the most decorated gymnast of all time. She finished with five gold medals in the all-around, team, vault, balance beam and floor competitions. It was the most successful world championships of her career. She continues to compete only against herself in a league of her own, and the quality of that one woman league is only increasing. Her 2.1 points buffer in the all-around final was the largest victory margin of her career, and she won her gold medal on the floor exercise by a point – meaning she could have fallen and still won.Biles has always won competitions by full points in a sport of tenths, but the gap only continues to widen as she improves at a faster rate than her rivals. At the Rio Olympics she grabbed the beam and last year in Doha she fell, but on Sunday she produced possibly the greatest beam routine of her career to win gold. Nowhere is Biles more prone to rolling her eyes than on the uneven bars, but as gymnasts flatlined around her in both the team and all-around finals, Biles was a rock. “This is probably my best worlds performance I’ve ever put out,” she said.The ease of Biles’s gymnastics only tells part of the story. Entering every competition with the understanding that she can only lose if she makes a mistake is a brutal burden in a sport where mistakes are always a millimetre away. Only a disaster stood between Biles and gold at the 2016 Games in Rio, so she and her then-coach, Aimee Boorman, tackled the pressure of her first Olympic cycle by being conservative and valuing consistency. Although she has always thrived under pressure, Biles wasn’t always comfortable with it.After achieving everything she dreamed of in the sport over the past two years, Biles has had to find new motivation. It was her new coaches, Laurent and Cecile Landi, who nudged her out of her comfort zone and in the direction of performing her ballistic new skills. She was weary at first, but now there appears to be no greater thrill for Biles than pushing herself and gymnastics to unimaginable heights, ensuring that when the shine of her trophies fade, her name will be indelibly written into the fabric of the sport.When Biles was asked before the competition if breaking records, winning medals or having skills named after her was more exciting, she was clear: “For me, getting the skills named after me is really exciting. Just to go out there and prove to myself that I can do them, especially under all of the pressure that will be there.”One of the joys of sport is witnessing an athlete’s journey as they mature on and off the podium, becoming more savvy with their skills and more expressive with their words. This is still a rare sight in gymnastics, where the careers of most top all-around female gymnasts are fleeting. Biles has been the exception. Her extended time at the top has allowed her to slowly come to understand the potency of her voice. She now speaks out frequently and loudly, from poignantly addressing her trauma over the Larry Nassar scandal to unabashedly asserting her greatness.“It’s important to teach our female youth that it’s OK to say, ‘Yes, I am good at this,’ and you don’t hold back,” Biles said recently to USA Today. “You only see the men doing it. And they’re praised for it and the women are looked down upon for it.”Biles left Stuttgart having proved plenty to herself by winning medals and securing her eponymous skills with relative ease. But some of Biles’ most memorable moments were simply her reactions – from opening her floor routines with her triple double and then beaming through the rest, to the way she applauded herself and then flitted from the podium in glee upon landing her double double dismount off the beam.“I really don’t know how I do it sometimes,” Biles said after her all-around victory. “Sometimes I wonder how I do it. I feel like it’s just like not me. I wish I could have an out-of-body experience to witness it because sometimes I think I’m going crazy.”At some point, Biles learnt how to truly enjoy competing against herself, and now she too can marvel at her greatness as it unfolds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/700f2692c9d8f7df581d1f03e9812576e4df7b6f/0_223_526_316/master/526.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64797aecb5f5399c5d45024ef6920532","title":"south korean startups gather momentum","story":"Technological advantages in South Korea have helped make it fertile ground for startupsIn a country where the biggest companies are still king, Seoul’s burgeoning startup sector is finding its feet.Out in the west of the South Korean capital, a nine-storey building dressed in bright colours with a giant red bull outside is home to more than 100 startups. From one-person operations running out of a locker and a laptop on the ground floor, to fully-fledged offices on the upper levels, Seoul’s startup hub has supported 1,282 operations in various stages of growth in the past two years.It has all the bells and whistles you come to associate with startup hubs across the world – shared dining and working spaces, a rest area with beanbags and egg-shaped couches, a fully decked-out kitchen for food-tech companies, a broadcast studio, a library, a slide between two floors and even a 7-Eleven for those powering through the night.There were about 467 accelerators, venture capital funds and government organisations supporting startups in Seoul and its surrounding province in 2018, some backed by bigger companies such as Samsung and Naver. There are 85 accelerators in Seoul, and the amount of angel investment increased from about US$170m ($250m) in 2015 to US$250m in 2017.Since 2015, the South Korean government has provided $4bn to startups, Forbes has reported, the biggest government backing of startups per capita in the world. In April, Seoul’s mayor, Park Won-soon, said the aim was to make Seoul a global top five startup city by 2022.Korea is particularly attractive for startups because of its high-speed internet, the fast rollout of the 5G network and the high uptake of technology.The push towards startups has been driven by slow growth from the traditional larger companies, according to Seoul Startup Hub co-founder Matt Kang.“We have lost the momentum from large companies – startups have emerged as a new momentum for Korea,” he said.One startup that moved into the hub just over a month ago is Amuse Travel– a social enterprise that provides tours for people living with disabilities to popular destinations around South Korea, as well as giving people living with disabilities the confidence to travel on their own. The company develops maps of tourist destinations based on data collected during the tours, highlighting the area’s positive and negative aspects – such as steep inclines, stairs and other barriers to access. The company’s founder, Seo-yeon Oh, said it had previously had difficulty raising enough investment, and needed more time to prove its viability of the company. He said Naver had expressed interest in the business. Moving into the startup hub meant Oh and his staff were able to network with a variety of businesses at various stages of life.“The strength of this hub is there is a wide spectrum of startup companies here from fintech to senior citizens, and also … startup companies which once experienced failure in the past,” he said.“Koreans seem shy, so they seem to work alone or independently, but they also co-work and work together.”Josh Taylor visited Korea as part of the Walkley Foundation Australia-Korea exchange program, in partnership with the Korea Press Foundation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/799379fe2a9713606a2d49daf6860d75852f961d/0_270_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a65df01f1a7f56481235902ffdb66361","title":"we put 20 tons of nuts in the post meet tvs most extreme superfans","story":"When Star Trek was due to be axed, they wrote letters in protest. Now fans mobilise on social media, picket the TV companies – and even go on hunger strikeModern fandom can seem an alien concept. Gone are the teens penning heartfelt letters to their favourite pinups. Today’s fans – or “stans”, named after the Eminem song about an obsessive stalker – are an online army ready to take on anyone that might threaten the object of their adoration. Most recently, fans of the cult Netflix show The OA have mounted a global campaign to have it reinstated after it was cancelled in August. Their tactics have taken fanaticism to the extreme: one demonstrator has even gone on hunger strike.Fandom and TV have long gone hand-in-hand. The television fan movement was arguably born with the 1966 campaign to keep a little-known new series named Star Trek on air. After low ratings for the first two seasons, NBC was ready to relegate the show to the trashpile. Hearing the news, husband and wife Betty Jo and John Trimble organised one of the first grassroots fan campaigns, kicking off a letter-writing chain that amassed over 110,000 missives and which led to the renewal of the show.Other fans have been far more extreme. Post-apocalyptic show Jericho was cancelled by CBS after one season in 2006, prompting its stans to send 20 tons of nuts to the network’s offices in protest. Inspired by a line from the final episode – predictably, “nuts” – the outpouring of nut-based feeling got the show one more season (albeit before it was axed again.)Sticking with the foodstuffs, sci-fi series Roswell was kept on-air for four seasons of plummeting ratings after fans bombarded its channel with bottles of Tabasco. As part of the “Roswell is Hot” petition, it is estimated that over 3,000 bottles of hot sauce were sent in total, until the campaign ran out of heat and the show was cancelled for good in 2002.When NBC threatened to axe high-school football drama Friday Night Lights in 2007, fans started sending streams of lightbulbs to their offices, as well as eye drops – a reference to the Dillon Panthers’ motto: “Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.” They saved the show for three more seasons. In 2018, the Adam Samberg-starring cop comedy Brooklyn Nine-Nine was rescued from cancellation following a massive Twitter backlash centring around the hashtag #SaveB99. The same year, another Twitter campaign ensured a two-and-a-half hour marathon finale for the cancelled Wachowskis’ sci-fi series Sense8.Obscure tactics aside, what prompts such visceral reactions to these shows? For self-described “Brooklyn Nine-Nine fanatic” Jack Cartwright, it was much more than just an easy watch. “It might seem overblown to say this, but TV shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine genuinely provide an escape from the often brutal day-to-day of work and responsibility,” he says. “When it was cancelled, I had to get involved to try and keep it on air.” Cartwright, who is 27 and based in Leeds, turned to Twitter, regularly posting #SaveB99 and encouraging others to sign petitions to show the huge appetite for more.“When it got picked up by NBC, I was ecstatic,” he says. “It shows that while places like Twitter can be a toxic online space, they can also be a community for real, positive change.” Cartwright was joined in posting his support by celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda and Guillermo Del Toro – with Miranda eventually landing a guest spot on the renewed series. Showrunner Dan Goor responded to the campaign, calling them “the best fans in the world.”For fans of The OA, though, the future is still uncertain. Created by Brit Marling and Zal Batmanglij in 2016, the sci-fi show centres around the reappearance of Prairie Johnson, a young blind woman missing for seven years who returns with her sight restored, now calling herself The OA. Cancelled after two seasons, the show built a dedicated following with many fans identifying with the erse characters, including transgender Buck and disabled Dr Marlow Rhodes. When the cancellation was announced, “discord groups” sprung up to organise flash mob protests at Netflix offices and coordinate calls to the company, as well as fundraise $5,000 for a huge #SavetheOA billboard in New York’s Times Square. The campaign has the feel of an insurgent political movement, yet it’s all for a television programme.“I had never been so moved by TV,” fan and season-two OA writer Claire Kiechel says. “I didn’t know TV was able to do what The OA was doing – it thrilled my imagination, and gave me solace and hope at a time I had lost it.” She believes the outpouring tapped into the deeper meaning the programme had for many. “The cancellation of a show which, for a lot of people had become a therapeutic totem or beacon of hope, can feel especially personal,” she says. “What’s happening with the Save the OA movement is a microcosm of what’s happening in our larger society – the youth climate strikes, the calls for corporate social responsibility. We’re all looking at the narratives we’ve been living in and finding them lacking, and asking if we can come together for a better world. Stories matter and there is a moral responsibility that comes with telling them.”The responsibility is so marked that one OA fan, Emperial Young, decided to go on hunger strike outside Netflix’s LA offices for a month – taking Sundays off – to protest her belief in its wider implications for society. “If nothing else I hope people can come away with the idea that art has an important place in the world,” says Young. “A lot of entertainment is feeding into the cycle of despondency, reinforcing the idea that we are powerless. The OA helps fight the hopelessness. Narrative can be a driving force that shapes reality.”Nonetheless, Netflix has been unresponsive to the protests, while creator Marling seems to have cryptically confirmed the end of the show with a lengthy Instagram post, saying how the fans’ efforts have become its new driving force – something greater than the series itself. Perhaps this, not tons of nuts or light bulbs, is the legacy of fandom: creating communities beyond the shows they formed around.“TV execs are losing out on a great opportunity – instead of seeing fandoms as enemies, they should collaborate with them,” says Kiechel. “Regardless of what happens with the show, I am lucky to be a part of this community and relearn what I knew as a child: art changes people. A story can give you the container, the metaphor, the name you’ve been missing all your life.”McDonough is still helping to run the Save the OA campaign, mobilising their 1 million YouTube subscribers to fundraise and arrange flash mobs. Her message is clear: “We will keep going as long as it takes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f92155d7959d0df9dbe3d33eed18f04ebd63f7/315_380_2579_1548/master/2579.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9fe2566c1e67d2d75eeb9d0be6c34b1","title":"russian troll freed belarus us election tampering","story":"Anna Bogacheva was detained and briefly threatened with extradition to the US after being named in Mueller reportA Russian national charged with attempting to meddle in the 2016 American presidential elections was briefly threatened with extradition to the United States after being arrested in Belarus, before she was was freed by local authorities. Anna Bogacheva was detained late on Monday evening by police at a hotel in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, while on holiday with her family, according to RIA Novosti, the Russian state news agency. Her lawyer said she had been detained under an international arrest warrant issued by the United States.Bogacheva was one of 13 Russians indicted last year by the US justice department after the investigation into election interference led by the special counsel Robert Mueller. Three Russian entities, including a notorious state-backed “troll farm” called the Internet Research Agency, were also indicted. Russia’s foreign ministry confirmed on Tuesday that Bogacheva had been arrested and said that it was providing consular assistance. But shortly after the foreign ministry statement, Russia’s embassy in Minsk announced that Bogacheva had been freed. A spokesman for Belarus’ general prosecutor’s office said that there were “no grounds” for her arrest or extradition to the United States. “She has been released,” the spokesman said, adding that Minsk would apply to have the international warrant for her arrest invalidated on the territory of Belarus. Mueller alleges that the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency’s employees, including Bogacheva, posed as US citizens to set up social media accounts aimed at swaying the 2016 presidential vote that brought Donald Trump to power, as well as sowing “discord” in the US political system. US investigators say the Internet Research Agency is controlled by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a wealthy businessman known as “Putin’s chef” because his companies often provide catering services to the Kremlin. Prigozhin is also reported to provide mercenaries for Russia’s military operations in Syria, Ukraine, and parts of Africa. Bogacheva is accused of working as a translator for the agency and overseeing its data analysis group. She and Alexander Krylova, another agency employee, travelled to the United States in June 2014 on what US investigators say was an intelligence gathering trip. Bogacheva’s arrest in Minsk briefly looked set to derail relations between Belarus and Russia. Viktor Vodolatsky, an MP from Vladimir Putin’s ruling United Russia party, accused Belarus of a “betrayal” before news of her release broke.

On 13 October, Kurdish leaders agreed to allow Syrian regime forces to enter some cities to protect them from being captured by\u0026nbspTurkey\u0026nbspand its allies. The deal effectively hands over control of huge swathes of the region to Damascus.That leaves north-eastern\u0026nbspSyria\u0026nbspided between Syrian regime forces, Syrian opposition militia and their Turkish allies, and areas still held by the SDF – for now.Before the SDF was formed in 2015, the Kurds had created their own militias who mobilised during the Syrian civil war to defend Kurdish cities and villages and carve out what they hoped would eventually at least become a semi-autonomous province.\u0026nbspIn late 2014, the\u0026nbspKurds were struggling\u0026nbspto fend off an Islamic State siege of Kobani, a major city under their control. With US support, including arms and airstrikes, the Kurds managed to beat back Isis and went on to win a string of victories against the radical militant group. Along the way the fighters absorbed non-Kurdish groups, changed their name to the SDF and grew to include 60,000 soldiers.For years, Turkey has watched the growing ties between the US and SDF with alarm. Significant numbers of the Kurds in the SDF were also members of the People’s Protection Units (YPG), an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) that has fought an insurgency against the Turkish state for more than 35 years in which as many as 40,000 people have died. The PKK initially called for independence and now demands greater autonomy for Kurds inside\u0026nbspTurkey.Turkey claims the PKK has continued to wage war on the Turkish state, even as it has assisted in the fight against Isis. The PKK is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US, the UK, Nato and others and this has proved awkward for the US and its allies, who have chosen to downplay the SDF’s links to the PKK, preferring to focus on their shared objective of defeating Isis.Turkey aims firstly to push the SDF away from its border, creating a 20-mile (32km) buffer zone that would have been jointly patrolled by Turkish and US troops until Trump’s\u0026nbsprecent announcement\u0026nbspthat American soldiers would withdraw from the region.Erdoğan has also said he would seek to relocate more than 1 million Syrian refugees in this “safe zone”, both removing them from his country (where their presence has started to create a backlash) and complicating the demographic mix in what he fears could become an autonomous Kurdish state on his border.Nearly 11,000 Isis fighters, including almost 2,000 foreigners, and tens of thousands of their wives and children, are being held in detention camps and hastily fortified prisons across north-eastern Syria.SDF leaders have warned they cannot guarantee the security of these prisoners if they are forced to redeploy their forces to the frontlines of a war against Turkey. They also fear Isis could use the chaos of war to mount attacks to free their fighters or reclaim territory.On 11 October, it was reported that at least five detained Isis fighters had escaped a prison in the region. Two days later, 750 foreign women affiliated to Isis and their children managed to break out of a secure annex in the Ain Issa camp for displaced people, according to SDF officials.It is unclear which detention sites the SDF still controls and the status of the prisoners inside.The strategically located town of Manbij, a US base for three years, remains a major military target for Turkey, its president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said on Tuesday. Shelling between Turkish proxy Syrian rebel forces and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) positions continued at intervals throughout the day, although there have been no reports yet of fighting inside the city itself.Moscow’s special envoy to Syria, Alexander Lavrentyev, said on Tuesday Russia opposed the Turkish operation and would not allow direct clashes between Turkey’s Nato troops and Syrian forces. The two sides stopped short of a direct confrontation when Ankara first put boots on the ground in Syria in 2016 to seize the area around Jarablus from Isis, in the process hampering the expansion of the SDF.The sweeping changes across north-east Syria were triggered by Donald Trump’s announcement last week that US troops would withdraw, in effect green-lighting a Turkish offensive on the SDF, which Ankara has long maintained is an offshoot of the militant Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK).The SDF was America’s ground partner in the five-year campaign against Isis, and lost 11,000 troops in the long battle. Donald Trump has attempted to rebut accusations even from his most loyal supporters that the move amounted to a betrayal.Despite the prospect of losing the area’s semi-autonomous status, Kurdish officials struck a Russian-brokered deal with Damascus on Sunday for reinforcements to protect Kurdish-held border positions. There are unconfirmed reports that talks are still under way to implement a Russian-enforced no-fly zone over the area.Syrian state media showed residents cheering the arrival of Assad troops in Manbij and Ain Issa, waving flags and throwing rice before the path of soldiers. The regime flag was also briefly raised above the famous clocktower square in Islamic State’s former capital of Raqqa on Monday night, a source in the city said, before it was taken down again by the SDF.Heavy fighting in the border towns of Tel Abyad and Ras al-Ayn as well as airstrikes and shelling of other Kurdish-controlled roads and towns has displaced 160,000 people from their homes and killed at least 165 civilians. SDF counterattacks over the border have left 20 Turkish civilians dead, including a Syrian baby.Erdoğan claimed on Tuesday his soldiers and allied Syrian rebels held 1,000 sq km of territory in north-east Syria. Despite the threat of US and EU sanctions, as well as European arms embargoes, Ankara would press on with the creation of a proposed 20-mile-deep (32km) “safe zone” on its border stretching from Manbij to Iraq, he said, in which Turkey wants to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees. Turkey denies the resettlement of mainly Arab Syrians from other parts of the country would amount to demographic engineering.The offensive has been widely condemned for precipitating a humanitarian crisis and risking the return of Isis, after about 750 people with links to the militant group took advantage of the chaos on Sunday to escape a Kurdish-run detention camp. Footage of Syrian rebel proxies summarily executing nine Kurdish civilians on a major highway has also prompted war crimes allegations."},{"url":null,"title":"college open","story":"Open days give you a great chance to gauge how good a fit your course and college choice will bePreparation can help you take full advantage of open day opportunities"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4049751.1571041800!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit coveney says deal possible this week as eu seeks uk concessions","story":"Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney TD  has said that  a deal between Britain and the European Union is possible, perhaps even this week, but there are still a lot of details to be worked out. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier at the EU Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, last Tuesday. Photograph: Stephanie LecocqAFPGetty Images.Tánaiste Simon Coveney has said a Brexit deal is still possible this week, despite the DUP hardening its opposition to a potential solution to the deadlock over the weekend.Speaking on Monday morning, Mr Coveney said: “A deal is possible, and it’s possible this month, may even be possible this week. But we’re not there yet.”“The message I would give is that we need to be cautious, this is not an easy job, we spent three years trying to get an agreement between the two sides that have made progress at different times, but certainly the last number of months have been difficult,” Mr Coveney said.UK prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to concede more ground to Brussels as UK and EU officials will resume talks in the Belgian capital on Monday.Time is rapidly running out if there is to be an agreement to put to EU leaders to sign off on at their two-day summit starting on Thursday.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said “technical-level” talks between officials over the weekend had proved “constructive”.But in a briefing to ambassadors of the remaining EU27 on Sunday in Brussels, he said that “a lot of work remains to be done”.The BBC reported that the UK has dropped a demand that the deal should include a veto for the Stormont Assembly. However, DUP MP Jim Shannon this weekend added his voice to opposition to the proposed compromise involving Northern Ireland remaining legally part of the UK customs union but in practice operating as an EU customs territory.Mr Shannon said the proposed “double customs” solution would not work because it would treat Northern Ireland “differently” to Britain.“It is simple. Are we being treated the same as England? No, we are not. Therefore, if we are not being treated the same as England, then we are not going to accept it,” he said.Sticking pointEarlier, Mr Johnson told senior ministers that, while a “pathway” to a deal could still be seen, there was “still a significant amount of work to get there”.In a cabinet conference call, he said they still had to be prepared to leave on Halloween without a deal.The sticking point remains the issue of the Northern Ireland backstop intended to guarantee there is no return of a hard Border with the Republic.Mr Barnier was reported to have raised concern about the complexity of a British plan to keep Northern Ireland in the UK customs territory while avoiding the need for border controls.There were reported doubts about the feasibility of the scheme which was said to involve tracking goods as they move through Northern Ireland and then determining the tariff to be paid depending where they end up.It raised the prospect that negotiations could carry on after this week, with the possibility of an emergency EU summit at the end of the month to finally approve any 11th hour agreement.However if Mr Johnson cannot get a deal by the weekend, he will come under intense pressure to seek a further Brexit delay, something he has vowed not to do.Labour however has warned that if necessary it will take action through the courts to force him to comply with the so-called Benn Act which requires to request an extension.Either way, the stage is set for a major Commons showdown when the prime minister returns to Westminster for an emergency Saturday sitting of parliament, the first in 37 years.If he cannot get a deal, he is widely expected to blame MPs for cutting the ground from under him, laying the ground for a “people versus Parliament” general election.If he is able to get an agreement, UK government sources have said they will seek to rush through legislation to ratify it in time for the promised Halloween withdrawal date.Some opposition MPs have signalled they could support an agreement if there was a requirement to put it to the public in a confirmatory referendum.However, UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn indicated he had little enthusiasm for the idea.“I think many in Parliament, not necessarily Labour MPs but others, might be more inclined to support it (if there was a referendum) even if they don’t really agree with the deal. But I would caution them,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Virginia MayoAP.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said progress is being made in closed-door Brexit talks between the EU and UK in Brussels.Speaking in Dublin, Mr Varadkar said it is “unclear” if a new deal will be struck by Tuesday night.However, he said he has yet to receive a “detailed” briefing from Brussels.He said the gap was still “quite wide” between the EU and UK, particularly on the issue of customs arrangements on the island of Ireland.“The initial indications are that we are making progress,” Mr Varadkar said. “The negotiations are moving in the right direction.”But whether the progress is sufficient to allow for a revised Brexit deal to be presented to the European Council meeting this week is “as of now unclear”, he added.“We are just going to have to see how the next few days go. If we can get to an agreement on Thursday or Friday and if the House of Commons is able to vote in favour of that agreement on Saturday it may not be necessary to even consider an extension but it is too early to make that assessment at this stage.”The Taoiseach also said his preference is still to hold an election in May 2020 and added that, unlike Fianna Fáil, he had not linked the survival of the Government to Brexit.Brussels talksThe prospects for a second EU summit this month continued to loom as the negotiating teams struggled to put legal language on a potential deal.Failure to reach a deal by tonight will see leaders agreeing to reconvene a summit later in the month, either to ratify a deal should the talks produce one, or to discuss an extension.In Luxembourg EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Tánaiste Simon Coveney were resolutely optimistic that a deal could still be done by this evening if the will was there.“Difficult but possible,” Mr Barnier told journalists and then member states at their meeting of Brexit ministers.It was “high time to turn good intentions into legal text,” he said. Speaking to journalists after the meeting Mr Coveney said he did not think “it’s inevitable” there would be no deal in time for a two-day leaders’ summit on Thursday.Progress in the talks was “slow and they will need to make significant progress today,” he said, “ if there is to be a deal that Michel Barnier can report on tomorrow to EU capitals in advance of the leaders’ summit.”Speaking after emerging from a briefing with Mr Barnier on Tuesday, the Tánaiste warned a lot of progress needs to be made over the next 24 hours between the EU and UK negotiating teams.“I don’t think it’s inevitable that they can’t get a deal before the summit,” Mr Coveney said. “I think what Michel Barnier said today was very clear, that it’s difficult but possible to have a deal between the two negotiating teams this side of the leaders’ summit.Mr Coveney emphasised that a legal text was required and said “there will not be negotiation of text at the summit. The EU is very clear on that. So if there is going to be a deal at the summit the task force and the British negotiating team have to finalise text.”Mr Coveney acknowledged “it is of course possible to move beyond the summit and continue talks next week because the UK is not due to leave the EU before the end of the month but from everybody’s perspective if we cloud bring clarity at this summit that would be a welcome development.”Mr Coveney would not be drawn on the substance of the talks but diplomats in Brussels say that, encouraged by Mr Barnier, in broad outline it is being welcomed by member states as the basis of agreement.However, some scepticism remains about the mechanics of the UK’s proposed customs controls.Going in to the meeting Dutch foreign minister Stef Blok said companies in the Netherlands will have to be assured “there are no byways into the single market from Northern Ireland”.The UK would have to give solid assurances on policing customs controls: “They have given some but not enough,” he said.France’s Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin said of the prospects for an extension that France still insisted that one would only be granted if, like an election, “it could change the political dynamic”.There is speculation in Luxembourg that, in the absence of a deal, leaders at the summit may agree to defer consideration of an extension until a second summit, at the end of the month, to allow Mr Johnson maintain his insistence that a deal remains possible that will allow the UK to leave on October 31st.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

All figures are compared with the last poll, carried out before the local and European elections in May.Support for Labour and Sinn Féin also declines slightly, while support for the Green Party has doubled from 4 per cent to 8 per cent since the last poll. Independents and other small parties see their aggregate rating unchanged.The increase in the satisfaction rating for the Taoiseach and the Government will most encourage Fine Gael as the party contemplates a possible pre-Christmas election in the event of a deal being concluded on Brexit.Mr Varadkar sees his personal rating jump by 15 points since May, ending an 18-month long period of decline. More than half of all voters (51 per cent) now say they are satisfied with Mr Varadkar’s performance as Taoiseach, his best rating in a year.Approval for the Government has also risen, with 42 per cent now saying they are satisfied with its performance, up from 31 per cent in May.In addition, there is strong approval for the Government’s handling of both the economy and Brexit. More than half of all voters (54 per cent) say the Government is doing a good job on handling the economy while six out of 10 voters (60 per cent) approve of the Government’s handling of Brexit.On making a compromise on the backstop, however, voters are almost evenly split – a small majority among those who expressed a preference (47 per cent) suggested that the Government should not compromise on the backstop to achieve a deal, even if this risks a hard border, with 42 per cent in favour of compromise.The approval rating for the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin has risen slightly, from 35 per cent to 38 per cent, though in his case the last comparative figure dates from March.The state of the parties, when undecided voters are excluded, is: Fine Gael, 29 per cent (no change) Fianna Fáil, 25 per cent (down one) Sinn Féin, 14 per cent (down two) Labour, 6 per cent (down one) Independentsothers, 18 per cent (no change) Greens, 8 per cent (up four).Among the smaller parties and Independents, Solidarity-People Before Profit are at 1 per cent (down one) among voters declaring a preference, the Social Democrats are at 1 per cent (down one), Independents4Change are at 2 per cent (no change), the Independent Alliance is at less than 1 per cent (no change), non-party Independents are on 10 per cent (down two) and other groups and parties are on 2 per cent (down one).The poll was taken on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, among a total of 1,200 voters across 120 sampling points in all constituencies.

Photograph: Dimitar DilkoffAFP via Getty ImagesRussian law enforcers ratcheted up pressure on Alexei Navalny on Tuesday, raiding the opposition leader’s offices across the country for the second time in just two months.Russia’s investigative committee announced that raids were taking place in 30 regions as part of an ongoing inquiry into suspected financial crimes by Mr Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. Several employees of the foundation had been called in for questioning, it said, without specifying any names.Allies of Mr Navalny said the massive police operation was aimed at intimidating the opposition and crippling the foundation, which publishes investigative reports into the misuse of state funds by Russian officials, including members of president Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.Helmeted police wielding batons swarmed into the foundation’s offices in more than 25 Russian cities before dawn on Tuesday, seizing computer technology and documents. The homes of some of Mr Navalny’s associates and their relatives were also targeted.“Cowardly loafers in little black hats are running about our offices,” Mr Navalny wrote on Twitter. “It’s already simply some kind of routine.”Leonid Volkov, Mr Navalny’s campaign manager, said law enforcers were also searching the homes of the foundation’s staff and supporters. “Even former employees, relatives and the ex-wives of employees” were being targeted, he wrote on Twitter.One of the Kremlin’s most popular and outspoken critics, Mr Navalny has been facing mounting official pressure since a wave of big anti-government demonstrations erupted in Moscow this summer over the disqualification of opposition candidates from a city parliament election.At the height of the protests in August the investigative committee, the main federal investigating authority in Russia, froze the bank accounts of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, claiming the organisation had laundered 1 billion roubles (€14.3 million) of illicit funds obtained from unnamed third parties over a period of years.The foundation has denied the charges, saying the sum it was accused of laundering was far larger than the donations it had received to finance its anti-corruption investigations.‘Foreign agent’Tuesday’s police raids came less than one week after the Russian justice ministry classified the foundation as a “foreign agent”, a label frequently used in Mr Putin’s Russia to brand non-governmental organisations critical of the Kremlin. Explaining the move, the ministry said the foundation had received funds from foreign sources, including more than $2,000 from a Florida-based company that sells doors. Mr Navalny denounced the accusations as lies.Mr Navalny is widely considered the only opposition leader capable of challenging Mr Putin. But the Russian president has never mentioned his arch foe by name in public or even acknowledged his existence. However, Kremlin-controlled television has taken to discrediting Mr Navalny since this summer’s election protests in Moscow.In a derogatory report on the demonstrations last Sunday, the state Rossiya 1 TV channel broadcast goofy videos of Mr Navalny surrounded by youthful supporters, identifying him as a ringleader of a subversive and violent opposition movement.In an emailed statement to his supporters on Tuesday, Mr Navalny admitted that the intensifying legal onslaught was complicating life for the foundation, but said it was also strengthening the opposition’s resolve. “We are doing the right thing. And those who are against us are the enemies of Russia,” he wrote."},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Strongest words yet from Assad-supporting Moscow heaps pressure on AnkaraErdogan vows to pursue offensive after Kurds agree to hand over key cities to AssadDundalk woman Lisa Smith may have been in Ain Eissa campTurkish military say it captured key border town under heavy bombardmentUS backing made the Kurds in Syria overconfident.

Photograph: Erdem SahinEPARussia has said Turkey’s military assault on northeastern Syria is “unacceptable”, heaping pressure on Ankara as Moscow seeks to capitalise on a US withdrawal from the region to help Syrian president Bashar al-Assad reassert control.Alexander Lavrentiev, President Vladimir Putin’s special envoy for Syria, told reporters that the offensive launched last week by Turkey against Kurdish forces in the country’s northeast had not been agreed with Russia, which has emerged as the most influential foreign power in Syria.In the harshest comments yet from a Russian official, Mr Lavrentiev said Moscow had “always believed that any military operation in Syrian territory is unacceptable”.He said the security of the Turkish-Syrian border “should be ensured . . . by way of deploying government forces along the entire border” – a suggestion that directly conflicts with Ankara’s plan to control a 32km-deep stretch of the country’s northeast.The warning from Moscow came two days after Kurdish forces struck an emergency deal with the Syrian regime in order to ward off a Turkish assault against them. That pact has seen Mr Assad, backed by Moscow, re-establish a military presence in several northern towns that had been controlled by US-backed Kurdish forces under the Syrian Democratic Forces umbrella.Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdogan insisted on Tuesday that Ankara was proceeding with its plan to assert control over a 480km stretch of the border from the Syrian town of Manbij, east of the Euphrates river, to the Iraqi border. He vowed to secure the region “within a short time”.But the strong words from Russia, which has become an important partner for Turkey in Syria, served as a reminder of the constraints likely to be imposed by other foreign powers. They came less than 24 hours after US president Donald Trump also set out his own red lines on the Turkish incursion and announced US sanctions on Ankara.Political obstacleSinan Ulgen, chairman of the Istanbul-based think tank Edam, said that, from a military perspective, Mr Erdogan could control the whole border region if he wanted to. But he added: “The obstacle is of a more political nature, about what happens if he decides to do it.”Kerim Has, a Moscow-based analyst of Russia-Turkish relations, said he believed that Mr Erdogan had hoped to gain “much more territory” after launching his offensive last week but had been boxed in by the rapidly shifting dynamics and the demands of Washington and Moscow.“Ankara, in my opinion, doesn’t have any choice other than reaching a deal with Russia and the US,” he said.Mark Esper, US defence secretary, said on Tuesday that US troops were retreating partially because they were “at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict”, underscoring fears that international powers could be dragged into direct confrontation in the chaotic northeast Syrian theatre.Despite a pledge by Mr Erdogan to send Turkish-backed Syrian rebel groups into Manbij, the Syrian army moved into the border town on Tuesday, filling a vacuum left by US forces whose bases there had been part of an effort to assuage Turkey’s security concerns.Russian military police are now patrolling between Turkish forces and Syrian troops in the Manbij district, Russia’s defence ministry said. Mr Lavrentiev said Moscow would work to prevent a direct clash between Turkish and Syrian troops, adding that “no one wants this kind of clash to happen”.Mr Lavrentiev also revealed that “real time” negotiations were taking place between the Turkish and Syrian defence and foreign ministries and their intelligence services. “A dialogue between Turkey and Syria is taking place, it is taking place continuously,” he said in remarks published by state-run news agencies.160,000 fleeAt least 160,000 people have fled a week-long Turkish military advance into northeastern Syria, launched by Mr Erdogan against Syrian Kurdish forces linked to Kurdish militants who have waged an insurgency inside Turkey for four decades.The Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) form the backbone of the SDF, trained and armed by a US-led coalition to combat Isis jihadis who had conquered swaths of northeast Syria. But Mr Trump decided to get US troops out of the path of Turkey’s army early last week, in effect ending US protection of its Kurdish allies and the semi-autonomous region the Kurds had carved out in north-east Syria.Battered by Turkish assault, which the SDF says has killed 75 people, the Kurds turned to the Syrian regime in Damascus, via Moscow, to blunt Ankara’s attack. Kamal Akif, spokesman for the SDF’s foreign affairs department, confirmed that the agreement pertains only to military arrangements thus far.

We only didn\u0027t know when\u0027An interstellar comet visiting our solar system is like nothing ever seen before, scientists have confirmed – but looks strangely familiar.The object, known as\u0026nbsp2IBorisov, has been examined by researchers who say that it has the potential to transform our understanding of the universe that surrounds us.Scientists have long thought that the gaps between the stars could be home to various comets and asteroids that have been thrown out of their home planetary systems. As they make their way through the universe, they would pass through our solar system and give us the opportunity to spot them, astronomers speculated.The first of those objects was seen two years ago, when scientists saw \u0027Oumuamua, and confirmed that such interstellar objects exist. Since then, they have been watching in hope of seeing another interstellar visitor.Astronomers now know that\u0026nbsp2IBorisov\u0026nbspis the second such alien visitor ever seen – and the first of its kind, a comet sailing through our solar system from another place entirely.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

We only didn\u0027t know when, said Piotr\u0026nbspGuzik\u0026nbspof the\u0026nbspJagiellonian\u0026nbspUniversity, who led a new study of the object.Scientists release picture of first comet from another solar systemResearchers were able to take pictures within two days that gave researchers a significant look at the object, and let them confirm that it was the first comet to visit us from another planetary system.We immediately noticed the familiar coma and tail that were not seen around \u0027Oumuamua, said Michal Drahus of the Jagiellonian University, who co-led the study with Guzik. This is really cool because it means that our new visitor is one of these mythical and never-before-seen \u0027real\u0027 interstellar comets.Further investigation suggested that it was oddly familiar, for something that had made its journey over such a distant way. Researchers found that it looks reddish and has a solid core that is about a kilometre across.Make of this what you will, but based on these initial characteristics, this object appears indistinguishable from the native Solar System comets, said\u0026nbspGuzik.Researchers will now be able to keep watching the object and learn more about it as it becomes even more visible.The comet is still emerging from the Sun\u0027s morning glare and growing in brightness. It will be observable for several months, which makes us believe that the best is yet to come, said\u0026nbspWaclaw\u0026nbspWaniak\u0026nbspof the\u0026nbspJagiellonian\u0026nbspUniversity, co-author of the study.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureKPMG’s prediction is in line with no-deal expectations by the government’s spending watchdog: in July the Office for Budget Responsibility said house prices will drop by 5.9 per cent in 2020.On the other hand, if a Brexit agreement is struck before 31 October, the housing market will avoid slipping into the red, according to S\u0026ampP. It sees a 1.5 per cent price rise in 2020 after stagnation this year.“We believe that Brexit uncertainty has already started to trickle down into lower housing prices and sales volumes, especially in London,” the agency said.According to the latest official data, house prices inched up by 0.7 per cent in July compared with a year earlier – the slowest pace of growth in almost seven years. Figures for August are due on Wednesday.The sluggish growth in prices will be welcomed by those yet to get onto the housing ladder.“House prices have been expensive here for quite some time,” Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said earlier on Tuesday, adding that housing affordability is “a challenge”.“It’s first and foremost driven by supply dynamics in the country. It continues to strike me that there is twice as many people in the United Kingdom as there is in my native Canada and the same amount of houses are built every year in the United Kingdom as in Canada.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of this month, house prices will end the year 1.7 per cent lower than in 2018, said Standard \u0026amp Poor’s (S\u0026ampP), one of the world’s three biggest providers of government and company credit scores to investors.Prices will then tumble another 10.2 per cent in 2020 and another 6.1 per cent in 2021, S\u0026ampP said in a report on Tuesday. House values will start rising again in 2022, but a predicted 5.9 per cent increase that year will undo only some of the previous losses.Although S\u0026ampP’s forecasts are at the gloomier end of recent predictions, many organisations expect substantial declines in UK house prices in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Last month, KPMG said prices could fall by around 6 per cent in 2020 in that case, “with a drop of 10-20 per cent not out of the question” if the market reacts more strongly than the consultancy projects.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureChristopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, commented: “We have seen evidence that customers are losing out due to the way in which some lenders are rewarding those who sell motor finance.”By banning this type of commission, we believe we will see increased competition in the market, which will ultimately save customers money.“The proposals come more than two years after the FCA launched a review into car financing in response to concerns about questionable practices in the sector.It will consult on the plans until 15 January, with final rules set to be published later in 2020.The FCA warned the sector in March to clean up its act amid concerns over the commission charged on car finance plans for new cars.Scott Cargill, chief executive of Admiral Financial Services, said: “The announcement from the FCA today will be welcome news to anyone buying a car from a dealership. For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Woodford will also be removed from his position as the fund’s investment manager with immediate effect.Mr Woodford, one of Britain’s best-known investment managers, was forced to freeze the fund\u0026nbspafter a run of poor performance scared investors into withdrawing their cash. That left the fund unable to sell off assets fast enough to meet further redemption requests.An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.The suspension was intended to give Mr Woodford\u0026nbsptime to change the composition of the portfolio to enable him to meet redemption requests.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean culture“Whilst progress has been made in relation to repositioning the fund’s portfolio, this has unfortunately not been sufficient,” Link said.“We have therefore concluded that it is now in the best interests of all investors for the fund to be wound up by way of an orderly realisation of the fund’s assets. This orderly realisation will allow the return of money through interim payments ... to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.”Mr Woodford commented:\u0026nbsp“This was Link’s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.”Many of the hundreds of thousands of savers who still have money locked in the fund are likely to get back less than what they originally invested.One investor who has invested with Mr Woodford for a number of years said: “I’ve lost almost £2,000 in his fund as I’m invested via my Hargreaves Lansdown Sipp and think HL has some questions to answer about promoting a fund that is now worthless.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSince Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis no longer the manager of the fund, it will be renamed as LF Equity Income Fund.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks “more and more difficult”.As a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: “There are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.”“And so, for the person who runs that business or works for\u0026nbspthat business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected … because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.”The central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a “potentially substantial number” of companies.Even those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.“They think that output will go down, they’ll have to let people go … That is the view of those firms.”Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMr Carney reiterated the warning\u0026nbspdespite noting in September that Britain, as a whole, had become better prepared for a no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspOne part of the economy where the impact of the Brexit process has been particularly visible is the volatile exchange rate,\u0026nbspand Mr Carney predicted more sharp moves ahead.Analysts, polled by Reuters earlier this month, forecast that the pound will\u0026nbspfall to $1.10-$1.19 if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. That will take a quarter off the currency’s value before the EU referendum in 2016.Likewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.Mr Carney said, on Tuesday, that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case, by bringing interest rates “close to but slightly above zero”. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Royal Mail is failing to honour an agreement reached last year to raise pay and reform pensions. The deal also included plans to reduce the working week and improve job security.Terry\u0026nbspPullinger, deputy general secretary of the\u0026nbspCWU,​\u0026nbspaccused Royal Mail bosses of breaking a progressive agreement\u0026nbspfor a successful postal service with social aims.\u0026nbspHe added: Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British Postal service in the interest of fast track profit and greed.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureReacting to the strike vote, Jeremy Corbyn called the Royal Mail a Tory-Lib Dem privatisation failure.The Labour leader tweeted: Its sell-off led to shareholders creaming profits off the top while running down the service.Union bosses hailed the result as the biggest vote in favour of national industrial action since the passing of the Trade Union Act in 2016 which imposed new restrictions on balloting for strikes.The CWU said the prospect of the first national postal strike in a decade now looms large.A mediation process already in place ends on Friday, then there are three weeks before a parting of the waves.CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: This result sends a clear message to Royal Mail Group - our members will not stand by as you rip up their terms and conditions and destroy the service they give to the public and businesses of the UK.We would urge Royal Mail Group to now enter serious negotiations with this union. We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspfood, known as fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), is often produced using destructive and sometimes illegal practices that “strip the ocean bare” and damage marine ecosystems, the report stated.The\u0026nbspinvestigation found that Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco, Asda, Iceland, Morrison’s, Waitrose and Marks \u0026amp Spencer all source fish from companies that use unsustainable FMFO as feed in their farms.Almost one fifth of the world’s annual wild fish catch is now taken out of the ocean to be ground down for FMFO to feed livestock or farmed fish.In India and Vietnam - two key countries for supplying this growing demand - collapsing fish stocks are pushing fishing vessels to “systematically plunder” the oceans for species that have not previously been caught for FMFO, Changing Markets found.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues

global warming as UN report reveals islands starting to vanish and coral reefs dyingGreenhouse gas emissions must be cut almost in half by 2030 to avert global environmental catastrophe, including the

exposed using DNA from illegal ivory shipmentsDNA taken from massive shipments of ivory has been used to identify the three largest wildlife trafficking gangs operating at the height of Africa’s elephant poaching epidemic.Vessels are also catching juvenile fish which should be left in their natural environment to reach maturity and ensure a stable fish population.\u0026nbspIn some cases, the researchers found FMFO had been exported with falsified food safety certificates.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who is supporting a campaign to improve standards in the industry, said FMFO was being sourced in ways that are devastating to the marine environment.“It’s increasingly clear that even products certified as sustainably produced are based on aquaculture that is sourcing fishmeal in deeply irresponsible ways. The bottom line is that we need to stop taking wild fish out of the ocean to feed farmed fish, before it’s too late,” he said.Scottish Salmon producers hit back at the criticism. A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) pointed out that: “Companies providing feed for Scottish farm-raised salmon have confirmed that none of them uses ingredients from the Gambia, Vietnam or India or from reef fishing – the main thrust of the criticism highlighted in the report. Any claim or suggestion that Scottish feed suppliers are sourcing from these fisheries would be wrong, misleading and inaccurate.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, major British retailers accept assurances from the body.\u0026nbspWhy we need to widen the net and eat more challenging fish cutsFMFO is becoming increasingly important as people eat more and more farmed fish. The report estimates that that farmed species will account for 62 per cent\u0026nbspof the seafood the world consumes by 2030.Natasha Hurley from Changing Markets, said: “Shoppers across the UK are totally unaware that the seafood they are buying has a dark secret.\u0026nbsp“The boom in aquaculture, to match the global demand for premium seafood products such as salmon, is fuelling illegal and unsustainable fishing practices which are stripping the oceans bare.“Climate change is already destabilising our food system and that’s being exacerbated by the FMFO industry, which will take anything and everything out of the ocean to meet demand from the growing aquaculture industry.\u0026nbspLeah Riley Brown, sustainability policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said fishmeal and fish oil were essential raw materials for creating good quality farmed seafood.\u0026nbsp“The use of wild-caught raw material as marine ingredients in fishmeal is becoming progressively more efficient as novel ingredients are gaining more traction as sustainable additions to the feed basket, which is alleviating pressures on wild fish stocks.”“This has been supported through utilising greater amounts of fishery and aquaculture processing by-product and increasing amounts of plant-based ingredients. Moreover, most remaining wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and oil would not typically be fished in significant quantities for human consumption and are sustainably and responsibly fished.“A Waitrose \u0026amp Partners spokesperson said that all of the company\u0027s fish feed was sourced from responsibly managed fisheries and met standards set by the IFFO.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Among the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year.“Pay growth continues to outstrip inflation, as it has done for over eighteen months now.Despite the 0.1 per cent rise in\u0026nbspunemployment to 3.9 per cent, the proportion of people jobless remains at its lowest level since the 1970s.The number of job vacancies fell again to 813,000, its lowest level since late 2017.“This is further evidence that the underlying weakness in economic growth is restraining labour market activity,” said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.“However, it could also be evidence that the uncertainty around Brexit is starting to impact firms’ hiring decisions. The survey evidence is consistent with a further softening in employment and wage growth going forward too.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Two thirds all car finance lending in 2017 was sold with this type of commission, up from just over one third in 2008.Scrapping it would end the inherent conflict of interest for brokers and encourage them to act in their customers\u0027 interests, the regulator said.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

For far too long, there has been a lack of transparency around how some car dealers make commission on sales. This has resulted in some customers overpaying for their loans by millions of pounds a year, but not really having any real idea by how much.\u0026nbsp“Now the FCA has shone a light on some of the shady ways commission is made, we expect to see more competition in the market and better deals for consumers.”\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They included an experiment known as Labeled Release, or LR, which was intended to look for signs of life on the planet.The results came back in 1976 – and seemed to indicate that something was happening on the surface.\u0026nbspGilbert V\u0026nbspLevin – an engineer and inventor who was the principal investigator on the experiment – has now written a long article arguing that those findings were indications of life on Mars, which were ignored by Nasa.“On July 30, 1976, the LR returned its initial results from Mars,” Levin wrote in an article for Scientific American.\u0026nbsp”Amazingly, they were positive.“As the experiment progressed, a total of four positive results, supported by five varied controls, streamed down from the twin Viking spacecraft landed some 4,000 miles apart. The data curves\u0026nbspsignaled\u0026nbspthe detection of microbial respiration on the Red Planet. The curves from Mars were similar to those produced by LR tests of soils on Earth.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 September“It seemed we had answered that ultimate question.”But Nasa’s experiments failed to find organic matter: the physical stuff of life itself, not just the indications of microbial respiration that the LR experiment discovered. That meant that Nasa concluded that the LR results came from a substance that was mimicking life but was not actually life itself.Comet visiting our solar system is ‘like nothing seen before’Since then, Nasa has not a run a similar experiment has focused on examining whether the Martian habitat could be a suitable home for alien life.But Levin argues that those findings actually suggested that\u0026nbspthere is alien life on Mars. And, he argued, Nasa must do more to follow them up – because they could pose a significant threat to life on Earth.“NASA maintains the search for alien life among its highest priorities,” he wrote.\u0026nbspOn February 13, 2019, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said we might find microbial life on Mars.“Our nation has now committed to sending astronauts to Mars. Any life there might threaten them, and us upon their return. Thus, the issue of life on Mars is now front and center.”Summing up the evidence of alien life, he wrote his experiment had found a whole host of positive results. But perhaps most strongly of all, he said there had been no experiment that had provided an alternative explanation for the results that came back from the LV experiment.“What is the evidence against the possibility of life on Mars? The astonishing fact is that there is none,” he wrote. “Furthermore, laboratory studies have shown that some terrestrial microorganisms could survive and grow on Mars.”In his conclusion, he asked that Nasa\u0026nbspconduct the same kind of experiments again, taking an altered version of the LR experiment to Mars on the next possible trip. And he asked that scientists be convened to examine those more than 40-year-old findings to see if they really were proof of life on Mars.“Such an objective jury might conclude, as I did, that the Viking LR did find life,” he wrote.\u0026nbsp”In any event, the study would likely produce important guidance for NASA’s pursuit of its holy grail.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Woodford will also be removed from his position as the fund’s investment manager with immediate effect.Mr Woodford, one of Britain’s best-known investment managers, was forced to freeze the fund\u0026nbspafter a run of poor performance scared investors into withdrawing their cash. That left the fund unable to sell off assets fast enough to meet further redemption requests.An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.The suspension was intended to give Mr Woodford\u0026nbsptime to change the composition of the portfolio to enable him to meet redemption requests.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Queen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

This orderly realisation will allow the return of money through interim payments ... to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time.”Mr Woodford commented:\u0026nbsp“This was Link’s decision and one I cannot accept, nor believe is in the long-term interests of LF Woodford Equity Income fund investors.”Many of the hundreds of thousands of savers who still have money locked in the fund are likely to get back less than what they originally invested.One investor who has invested with Mr Woodford for a number of years said: “I’ve lost almost £2,000 in his fund as I’m invested via my Hargreaves Lansdown Sipp and think HL has some questions to answer about promoting a fund that is now worthless.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspSince Mr Woodford\u0026nbspis no longer the manager of the fund, it will be renamed as LF Equity Income Fund.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government has rejected claims a Brexit deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU leaders’ summit on Thursday. The bloc’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said a deal is still possible this week but added that it looks “more and more difficult”.As a crash-out exit remains a possibility, Mr Carney said: “There are likely to be circumstances in an abrupt no-deal Brexit where certain businesses become uneconomic and they close.”“And so, for the person who runs that business or works for\u0026nbspthat business or has someone in their family who works for that business, they will be directly affected … because of a loss of a market or potentially shorter-term disruption.”The central bank governor has previously made similar forecasts. In August, he said a no-deal Brexit would deliver a blow to a “potentially substantial number” of companies.Even those businesses that survived would not emerge unscathed, he suggested at the time, citing a survey of 10,000 firms by the central bank.“They think that output will go down, they’ll have to let people go … That is the view of those firms.”Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMr Carney reiterated the warning\u0026nbspdespite noting in September that Britain, as a whole, had become better prepared for a no-deal outcome.\u0026nbspOne part of the economy where the impact of the Brexit process has been particularly visible is the volatile exchange rate,\u0026nbspand Mr Carney predicted more sharp moves ahead.Analysts, polled by Reuters earlier this month, forecast that the pound will\u0026nbspfall to $1.10-$1.19 if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. That will take a quarter off the currency’s value before the EU referendum in 2016.Likewise, economists, including those at the Bank of England, have been warning of a stark impact on the broader UK economy from a disorderly Brexit.Mr Carney said, on Tuesday, that the bank has some ability to support the economy in that case, by bringing interest rates “close to but slightly above zero”. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Communication Workers Union (CWU) said Royal Mail is failing to honour an agreement reached last year to raise pay and reform pensions. The deal also included plans to reduce the working week and improve job security.Terry\u0026nbspPullinger, deputy general secretary of the\u0026nbspCWU,​\u0026nbspaccused Royal Mail bosses of breaking a progressive agreement\u0026nbspfor a successful postal service with social aims.\u0026nbspHe added: Our members take honour seriously and have voted to fight for that agreement against those who now seek to break up the great British Postal service in the interest of fast track profit and greed.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Police officers carry away an activist as Extinction Rebellion protesters block a road with caravan in central London, BritainQueen Elizabeth II sits with Prince Charles on the Sovereign\u0027s throne ahead of delivering the Queen\u0027s Speech at the State Opening of ParliamentGreat Britain\u0027s Joe Fraser competes on Parallel Bars during the World Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart, Germany.

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureReacting to the strike vote, Jeremy Corbyn called the Royal Mail a Tory-Lib Dem privatisation failure.The Labour leader tweeted: Its sell-off led to shareholders creaming profits off the top while running down the service.Union bosses hailed the result as the biggest vote in favour of national industrial action since the passing of the Trade Union Act in 2016 which imposed new restrictions on balloting for strikes.The CWU said the prospect of the first national postal strike in a decade now looms large.A mediation process already in place ends on Friday, then there are three weeks before a parting of the waves.CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: This result sends a clear message to Royal Mail Group - our members will not stand by as you rip up their terms and conditions and destroy the service they give to the public and businesses of the UK.We would urge Royal Mail Group to now enter serious negotiations with this union. We also call on the public to get behind this dispute and your postal workers.We are very proud of our members today. They have stood by their union in record numbers and given hope to workers across the nation.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

New York native Iliza Shlesinger brings a fresh take on topics from modern dating to wedding planning headaches. Her show is a delightful mix of reality checks and insightful takes.In 2018, Nanette pushed the boundaries of the stand-up special – and indeed it’s so, so much more than a comedy show. In a little more than an hour, Hannah Gadsby deconstructs the makings of a good joke, explains why she’s done with self-deprecation, and delivers an unforgettable, incredibly powerful take on the trauma she’s experienced as a lesbian in Tasmania.Standout line: “I have built a career out of self-deprecating humour and I don’t want to do that anymore. Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”In a statement announcing the late-night pilot, which she will executive-produce with Judd Apatow and Amy Zvi, Silverman said: “I’m as passionate talking about my face-washing routine as I am talking about why billionaires cost us money.“Nothing’s off the table and nothing’s too high or low brow for me. I mean, look at my face, I’m literally all brow.”Silverman is currently shooting opposite Jennifer Lopez in the forthcoming romantic comedy Marry Me and is adapting her memoir The Bedwetter: Stories of Courage, Redemption, and Pee into a musical that will premiere in 2020.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This\u0026nbspfood, known as fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO), is often produced using destructive and sometimes illegal practices that “strip the ocean bare” and damage marine ecosystems, the report stated.The\u0026nbspinvestigation found that Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Aldi, Lidl, Co-op, Tesco, Asda, Iceland, Morrison’s, Waitrose and Marks \u0026amp Spencer all source fish from companies that use unsustainable FMFO as feed in their farms.Almost one fifth of the world’s annual wild fish catch is now taken out of the ocean to be ground down for FMFO to feed livestock or farmed fish.In India and Vietnam - two key countries for supplying this growing demand - collapsing fish stocks are pushing fishing vessels to “systematically plunder” the oceans for species that have not previously been caught for FMFO, Changing Markets found.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Davos 2019: David Attenborough issues

researchers found FMFO had been exported with falsified food safety certificates.Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, who is supporting a campaign to improve standards in the industry, said FMFO was being sourced in ways that are devastating to the marine environment.“It’s increasingly clear that even products certified as sustainably produced are based on aquaculture that is sourcing fishmeal in deeply irresponsible ways. The bottom line is that we need to stop taking wild fish out of the ocean to feed farmed fish, before it’s too late,” he said.Scottish Salmon producers hit back at the criticism. A spokesperson for Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) pointed out that: “Companies providing feed for Scottish farm-raised salmon have confirmed that none of them uses ingredients from the Gambia, Vietnam or India or from reef fishing – the main thrust of the criticism highlighted in the report. Any claim or suggestion that Scottish feed suppliers are sourcing from these fisheries would be wrong, misleading and inaccurate.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite this, major British retailers accept assurances from the body.\u0026nbspWhy we need to widen the net and eat more challenging fish cutsFMFO is becoming increasingly important as people eat more and more farmed fish. The report estimates that that farmed species will account for 62 per cent\u0026nbspof the seafood the world consumes by 2030.Natasha Hurley from Changing Markets, said: “Shoppers across the UK are totally unaware that the seafood they are buying has a dark secret.\u0026nbsp“The boom in aquaculture, to match the global demand for premium seafood products such as salmon, is fuelling illegal and unsustainable fishing practices which are stripping the oceans bare.“Climate change is already destabilising our food system and that’s being exacerbated by the FMFO industry, which will take anything and everything out of the ocean to meet demand from the growing aquaculture industry.\u0026nbspLeah Riley Brown, sustainability policy advisor at the British Retail Consortium, said fishmeal and fish oil were essential raw materials for creating good quality farmed seafood.\u0026nbsp“The use of wild-caught raw material as marine ingredients in fishmeal is becoming progressively more efficient as novel ingredients are gaining more traction as sustainable additions to the feed basket, which is alleviating pressures on wild fish stocks.”“This has been supported through utilising greater amounts of fishery and aquaculture processing by-product and increasing amounts of plant-based ingredients. Moreover, most remaining wild-caught fish used in fishmeal and oil would not typically be fished in significant quantities for human consumption and are sustainably and responsibly fished.“A Waitrose \u0026amp Partners spokesperson said that all of the company\u0027s fish feed was sourced from responsibly managed fisheries and met standards set by the IFFO.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Nearly one million people were expected to attend Sunday and Monday\u0027s carnival to celebrate Caribbean cultureHe added: “There is evidence and reports that many employers are currently adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach on employment given the current heightened uncertainties.”The total number of people in work fell by 56,000 over the three-month period, taking the overall employment rate down to 75.9 per cent from 76.1 per cent.ONS deputy head of labour market statistics Matt Hughes said: “The employment rate is still rising year-on-year, but this growth has cooled noticeably in recent months. Among the under-25s, the employment rate has actually started to fall on the year.“Pay growth continues to outstrip inflation, as it has done for over eighteen months now.Despite the 0.1 per cent rise in\u0026nbspunemployment to 3.9 per cent, the proportion of people jobless remains at its lowest level since the 1970s.The number of job vacancies fell again to 813,000, its lowest level since late 2017.“This is further evidence that the underlying weakness in economic growth is restraining labour market activity,” said Thomas Pugh, UK economist at Capital Economics.“However, it could also be evidence that the uncertainty around Brexit is starting to impact firms’ hiring decisions. The survey evidence is consistent with a further softening in employment and wage growth going forward too.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Last month, the Government announced a review of special needs services.It has also promised an extra £million next year for pupils with the most complex needs.

It has, but perhaps not for the reasons she thought.It gives us a real insight into the reality of fame and the ­obsessive paranoia that can go with it.Although she is used to living out her ­personal dramas in the public eye, Coleen has ­forgotten that public spats, especially those waged on social media, never end well.All too often, they reflect badly on BOTH parties. And they can lead to a social media pile-on that seriously affects people’s lives.Rebekah cut short her ­holiday this week and has had to contend with some truly vile trolling about her children and even her unborn baby.Meanwhile, what Coleen has failed to grasp is this: Something is only a secretyou are the only person who knows about it.The moment you share your secrets on social media — even in a “private” group — you risk those secrets escaping into the real world.You know, the real world, where friends meet up for a glass of wine and a long chat, talking about their lives rather than sharing edited highlights via social media.That is what friends are for. I couldn’t survive without my friends and would far rather chat to them than post on social media.If you suspect someone is stealing your secrets and selling them on, wouldn’t any right-thinking person simply cut them out of their le Why bother laying an elaborate trap to catch the culpritthe main objective is to stop it happening and get negative people away from you To me, it feels very teenagerish, the sort of thing you do in school, not when you are a grown woman with four kids.The s Coleen went to ­suggest she has a bit too much time on her hands.Perhaps this is a by-product of an obsession with your privacy — when you want it, that is, and not when you are selling your wedding photos to glossy celebrity magazines.You develop such a high opinion of yourself that you truly believe the world and his we are on ­tenterhooks about the latest minutiae of your domestic le.This story highlights something : The impact fame can have on someone’s ego and their sense of their own importance.  Really, Coleen just needs to get over herself.WE desperately need to do something about one in three primary school kids being dangerously fat – double the rate of  years ago.But banning consumption of all food and drink on public transport – as well as pies at football matches – would be scratching the wrong itch.Isn’t the real answer to educate people about healthy eating and stop companies marketing sugary foods to children  Alongside spending more time and money promoting sport so kids move more and eat less Don’t get me wrong, I object to people eating food on the Tube.

It wasn’t so long ago the EU ruled out EVER re-opening the negotiations and Britain was hurtling towards a No Deal crash. What made the dference  Could it be that our friends in Brussels were riled at the idea of Boris fighting an election while blaming them for Britain not getting out on time Things started to change on Tuesday when a No source briefed details of a call between the PM and Germany’s Angela Merkel. The insider’s memo said their conversation made it clear a deal was “overwhelmingly unlikely”.Bearing all the hallmarks of Boris Johnson’s de facto chief of staff Dominic Cummings, it was texted to James Forsyth, Sun columnist and Political Editor of The Spectator. In chilling tones, it raised fears Boris was heading flat out for No Deal.It threatened: “Supporting delay will be seen by this Government as hostile interference in domestic politics. Any delay will be negotiated between you, Parliament and the courts. We will focus on winning the election on a manesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave.”Feathers were ruffled across the Channel — yet within two days Boris and Irish Taoiseach Varadkar agreed to meet then said they could “see a pathway” to Brexit deal. EU Council President Donald Tusk had earlier made clear his anger at the original briefing, tweeting at the PM: “What’s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game.”Outrage aside, Tusk is a seasoned politician and is wise enough to know a general election is coming. Evenhe asked for a humiliating extension, Boris could come back with a majority and a strengthened mandate to take the country to No Dealnecessary.It would have given the EU a reason to pause. Did they really want to take such a big risk and damage relations with the UK, especiallyBoris was going towith No Deal in his manesto  Boris has blustered his way through the critics, promising to “get Brexit done” despite the odds ening every day.At times it has all looked a bit desperate. But the UK doesn’t hold all the cards. To get a deal through, Boris needs the Irish government to compromise too. Varadkar’s stubbornness was a sticking point. Ireland’s leader, like everyone , knows Theresa May’s deal was not supported in Parliament.Showing no signs of movement on the issue would make the Irish just as culpable of creating a hard border as those in Westminster. This hardline briefing is not how any of us want to deal with our friends and allies in Europe. But the brinkmanship looks like it has produced results.We are not out of the woods by any means. At this moment, we are still not clear on any details of the new proposals. So you can see why No kept up the pressure on No Deal, why Chancellor Sajid Javid committed to spending more than £billion to get the Government ready to go and why Michael Gove is working on plans to put all that spending in place.For all the worry about No Deal, keeping it on the table was a necessary step to strengthen our position. Claims the Government was looking for a legal loophole to remove the obstacles now appear fancul.But the EU would have taken note and would have worried about stubbornly sticking to its positionthe threat of No Deal suddenly reappeared. If we are serious about a deal, No should end the hardline rhetoric. The EU will not make this easy. And why should they  But their cautious welcome of the breakthrough with Ireland means we have reasons to be cheerful.Now is the time for cool heads and for Boris to engage in a statesmanlike way. He needs to get to grips with the detail of exactly how we can make an alternative to the backstop work. Sadly, that’s not even the hard part.Any deal will need to come back to Parliament, where tribal loyalties, political positioning and genuine anger have intensied in recent months. There is almost no chance opposition parties will back anything that comes back from Brussels.So the only way to deliver Brexit is to bring together the fractious parts of the Conservative Party, the breakaway Tory rebel MPs and the hardcore Brexit “Spartans”.There is hope this can be done. The rebels will want to avoid a No Deal exit, which any deal would prevent, and the Spartans have started to see that leaving in an orderly way may be the only chance they have to get us out.The alternative could be more months of delay, ending in a second referendum. None of which they could possibly want. And there is one other group to win over, the dangerously dficult DUP.They are critical to parliamentary success. So far, they have stayed tight-lipped about the latest developments, only reiterating their original position of leaving with the rest of the UK.He needs to get Brexit done so he can start repairing the damage getting us here has created. There are  hours until the next EU meeting, when the fate of the country will be decided. Let’s make them count. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

While other stars including Rita Ora and Kylie’s sister Kendall have posted snaps of themselves holding cute bunnies — fuelling the increase in popularity.Cara’s pet, Cecil, even has his own Instagram account.But Megan’s severe condition means she may never make a full recovery.Owner Jodie Salt, , from Frodsham, Cheshire, said: “The vet said it was an ear infection, and suspected ear parasite.“Megan was given antibiotics for the infection, but the vet did say that it’s not uncommon and she may never recover her posture.“It affects her balance so you have to be very careful about picking her up otherwise she starts spinning because she feels disoriented. We really panicked when we first saw her in this state.”Lop eared bunnies — which account for more than half of Britain’s pet rabbits — are some of the worst affected, with experts warning they are more susceptible to a host of medical problems because of their floppy ears.A recent study by the Royal Veterinary College, published in the journal Vet Record, showed lops are far more likely to suffer excessive ear wax, ear pain and dental problems due to the shape of their head.They are also at an increased risk of injury and even prone to obesitytheof their ears restricts their movement, according to the report.Mini lop brothers Comet and Cupid are two such victims — and their problems ended in tragedy.Rae Todd, , from Taunton, Somerset, a director at the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund, rescued the adorable bunnies on Christmas Eve, .She said: “Comet and Cupid weren’t even a year old. A combination of their breed and a poor diet meant that they both had horrendous dental problems.“They were both such lovely boys, but probably both were in extreme pain.“X-rays of Comet’s teeth showed how the roots were erupting out of his jaw. He had to be put to sleep just a few days later.“He had about a week of freedom and love, but he was in such pain that he was not really able to enjoy it.”Cupid was also put to sleep, as was Rudolph, another brother rescued at the same time who had an ear abscess, “the size of a golf ball” and was put on a palliative pain plan.Amy Ockleford, , a press officer, from Horsham, West Sussex, believes her late bunny, Louie also suffered ear problems.She said: “I often wonderedLouie’s lop ears made him partially deaf. He was quite a nervous rabbit and could be shy and skittish around people.“He would frighten easily and was jumpy. As a prey animal, not being able to hear well made him anxious. It’s sad to think that having lop ears impacted on his general state of wellbeing.”It is not just lop eared bunnies who are suffering.A landmark survey of more than , pet rabbits taken by vets found that lives of bunnies of all kinds were being blighted by overgrown claws and teeth, anorexia and myiasis, or flystrike, an often fatal condition caused by flies laying eggs on a rabbit’s skin.Worse still, rabbits kept alone in hutches are thought to suffer crippling loneliness.Dan O’Neill, a vet at the Royal Veterinary College who co-authored the research, said: “In rabbits we have a social species that is kept in isolation. That’s the ultimate punishment.”Then there’s the problem with pedigree breeding, leading to health warnings similar to those about French bulldogs and Persian cats, which have also become popular on social media, but can suffer breathing problems from being bred to have flatter faces.Now vets are warning about rabbit ieties such as the lionhead, which struggles to breath thanks to it short muzzle and mane of fur.Daniella Dos Santos, President of the British Veterinary Association, added: “Sadly, vets tell us that all too often they’re seeing clients who have chosen a pet with certain features without being aware of the serious health and welfare problems they may have as a result.’“It’s critical that prospective owners think ‘health over looks’ when choosing a pet, as extreme features may come hand in hand with hereditary problems that can lead to serious health problems and be distressing and costly to treat.”The University of Nottingham’s School of Veterinary Medicine and Science has just published the results of its global survey of , people in which participants were asked to rate the “cuteness” of pictures of rabbits from one to .The experiment, dubbed “bunny Tinder” was conducted in a bid to combat breeding of rabbits with extreme facial features, such as very flat faces.It found that people are more attracted to animals with mildly flat faces, but interestingly, it also revealed pointed ears are preferable to lop ears.Animal welfare expert and lead author of the study, Naomi Harvey, said: “Despite lop eared rabbits being very popular pets, people actually preferred erect-eared rabbits slightly more than lops.“Since lop-ears are also associated with higher risk of ear and dental problems, this is an interesting find.”The British Rabbit Council, however, believes pet owners should not shy away from lop breeds and its chairwoman, Hazel Elliott, is critical of the survey.She said: “The smaller lops, the dwarves and minis, very rarely have problems. Those make up the highest number of lops.“I’ve had dwarf lops that have lived to  years old and never had an ear problem.“If you speak to people who breed them to show, and would only breed two healthy animals together, I’m quite sure they would report the same.“You can get ear infections in the larger lops, the French and English, but it tends to happen when they have other health problems as well. The problem with the paper is that it was a very small study, undertaken with rabbits from a rabbit rescue who are unlikely to have been very well cared for before they ended up in a rescue.“With studies of this type, it’s really important not to take the evidence too seriously. It would need to be a much bigger study.”Both the RSPCA and British Rabbit Council recommends buying pet rabbits from reputable, responsible breeders.The BRC is happy to put prospective owners in touch with respected breeders.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT.They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.Photos show the monkeys strapped to seats in rows on the wall while others have their heads in restraints.According to the undercover activist, the animals are treated violently by the workers, who are not trained animal carers.The cats are often given up to  injections per day by untrained professionals and left to suffer, it has been claimed.Police have been alerted to conditions at the lab and are investigating.The activists also claim the laws in Germany protecting animals from experiments are not strict enough and call for the laws to be tightened.LPT is a family-owned laboratory carrying out toxicity testing for pharmaceutical, industrial and agro-chemical companies from all over the world.The company says it carries out its research in accordance with national and international guidelines.According to the organisation Cruelty Free International: Toxicity testing involves poisoning animals to see how much of a chemical or drug it takes to cause serious harm, in an attempt to measure what a safe dose for humans might be.Animals are injected with or made to eat or inhale increasing amounts of a substance to measure the toxic effects which can be severe and include vomiting, internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fever, weight loss, lethargy, skin problems, organ failure and even death.No anaesthetics or pain relief are provided.Michelle Thew, Chief Executive of Cruelty Free International stated: Our investigation has uncovered appalling animal suffering, inadequate care, poor practices and breaches of European and German law.We are also calling for a comprehensive review into the use of animals in regulatory toxicity testing in Europe, including the UK.

Dficult times ahead.They have previously insisted they would not counter a full border in the Irish sea as it would ide the United Kingdom.It came as:Boris Johnson wants to seal a deal that he can bring back for MPs to have a vote on on Saturday as the Commons gears up for a bumper session.And he also told ministers the UK wont be granted an FTA like the ones the bloc has with Canada or Japanit refuses to align with EU rules.Belgian deputy PM Didier Reyndrs said earlier: If we have an agreement tonight it will be possible to go to the Council and then again to the British parliament.Irish PM Mr Varadkar’s deputy Simon Coveney raised the prospect of an emergency EU Council next week — but onlythe UK compromises further.A big step forward needs to happen today, he said earlier.But he seemed to pour cold water on the idea of a firm deadline of tonight to get an agreement in place.He said: We are not putting any deadlines on these discussions. Its possible to move beyond the summit and continue talks next week.If the deal cant be done today or tomorrow then the leaders will have to decide what kind of mandate they want to give Michel Barnier and the UK side will have to respond as well as to how to proceed.This morning Boris had a -minute long phonecall with Frances President Macron, which was described as constructive.The PMs spokesperson said: The Prime Minister said that in advance of the EU council UK officials would continue to work hard on securing a deal.A spokesperson for the French President said there was positive momentum but stressed we cannot sayit will land on the good side tonight.He is said to have told the PM he isnt keen for a delay but raised the possibility of a short technical extension to finalise a deal.Yet that will be fiercely opposed by Boris, who has promised hundreds of times to leave on October .And an upbeat Jacob Rees Mogg said the government was “near a conclusion” with Brexit and that “big changes are happening” regarding the current impasse.He said it was too early to tellthere would be a need for a special sitting of MPs at the weekend - but insisted the votes were there in Parliament.Last night hopes were damped by Antti Rinne, whose country holds the rolling presidency of the EU.He said: I think there is no time in a practical or legal way to find an agreement before the EU council meeting. We need more time.If Boris doesnt seal a deal in time for the summit, its unlikely he will have a proposal to put forward to MPs on Saturday.A meeting of Europe’s  leaders in Brussels on Thursday is the last moment to agree an exit package before a law by MPs to delay our EU exit by three months kicks in on the  October.It came amid talk of a fudge that would see leaders sign off on a political deal before the st but leave the technical details for later.If talks progress rapidly a partial text could be shown to leaders, who would sign off on a final round of negotiations to hammer out the details.The next  hours of talks are deemed to be crucial to crack a legal solution on customs and consent.With talks on a kne-edge Boris cancelled a planned Cabinet meeting today as both sides focus on negotiations.Downing Street sources said the Cabinet meeting had been moved to Wednesday “to allow for a more detailed update of the EU negotiations”.Meanwhile, Remainers are planning to force Boris into seeking a delay to Brexit evenMPs sign off on his deal at the weekend.They are said to be concerned that hardline MPs who want a No Deal could vote for Boris deal but then vote down laws to implement Brexit in the coming days.Some dont think theres enough time to get it all done before October .Rebel Dominic Grieve said at the weekend: Evenhe does get it approved, it seems to me that the Prime Minister would go back to the EU and ask for an extension, at least until early new year, so we can do this properly.TODAY:Michel Barnier updates EU ministers on Brexit progress.TOMORROW: THURSDAY:Boris Johnson and other EU leaders fly to Brussels for the European Council.FRIDAY:Day  of the summit where Boris hopes to have sealed a deal.SATURDAY:Commons set to sit on a Saturday for the first time in decades.PM could bring back a deal for MPs to vote on.Remainer MPs could try and push a vote on a second referendum.No insisted there would still be time to pass the Withdrawal Act through Parliamentnegotiations slip into next week — as they’ll force MPs to work through the night.The PM’s official spokesman added: “The public would expect we work round the clock in order to pass that legislation in time for October .”This morning ex-Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was going to be very dficult but it was still possible to get a deal done.If we get a deal, people would heave a sigh of relief.But he added: If we need a few extra days beyond October , I dont think the  per cent who voted leave would mind as long as we are on our way.He stressed that the last week had been encouraging as the Irish seem to have changed their calculations.Mr Hunt added: [They have] worked outthey had to face a Boris Johnson with a majority in parliament after a general election, that might be someone who is actually harder to deal with than the Boris Johnson they have now.The Tories are leading with  per cent of the vote, and Labour slumping down to  per cent.Boris could pick up  seatsthe vote share is reflected in an election.TORY party leaflets which could be used in a snap election suggest Boris Johnson may have to delay Brexit again.Leaked flyers obtained by the BBC show some of the arguments the party may useit gets a snap poll within weeks.One read: Nigel Farage cant deliver Brexit, but he could block it.That suggests that Britain may not be out of the EU by October  as the PM has repeatedly promised.Getting Brexit done by  October is absolutely crucial, he said yesterday in Parliament.If he doesnt get a deal by Saturday  October, a law passed last week will force him to ask the EU for another delay.The earliest time an election can take place is in late November."},{"url":null,"title":"labour mps tell party bosses they wont back snap election","story":"Backbenchers are concerned that they are “not ready” to take on the Tories after damning poll results leave them lagging behind.MPs clashed at a Parliamentary Labour Party meeting after chairman Ian Lavery said the party should take to the streets before another referendum on Brexit, PoliticsHome reports.But others claimed Mr Corbyn - who said the party was “champing at the bit” for an election - could cost them votes at a local level when out campaigning.The Labour boss was branded a “chicken by Boris Johnson for twice voting against a snap election in the Commons, last month.One MP at last night’s meeting said: We had  minutes from Lavery telling us we are election ready and an hour of MPs saying we are not.Another said: Lavery just read out a list of things we will do, like deliver leaflets, direct mails and knocking on doors.

The -year-old monarch is said to have asked for a copy of the Queenaposs Speech a week in advance to ensure there was no slips up during her reading today.Lat month judges ruled that Boris Johnson lied to the Queen over his reasons for proroguing parliament and that the suspension of parliament was unlawful.And body language expert Judi James has studied the reading of the Queenaposs Speech in the House of Lords earlier today.    What body language Judi James said... The Queen is one of the best professional body language maskers in public le, able to disguise her genuine emotions in public to present a regal and often neutral front. This, along with her age, can make reliable readings less accurate than they are with most of those politicians watching her speech today.

She unveiled  new Bills in Parliament, which probably wonapost be made law because Parliament is likely to be dissolved for an election. But that wasnapost the only way she happened to fulfil the PMaposs political dreams. Thereaposs also Brexit. Her Majesty turned heads with the opening words of her speech - because they were all about Brexit. She even explicitly mentioned the exit date of October . Now, itaposs important to note the government - not the Queen - writes the Queenaposs Speech. And on closer inspection her wording definitely wasnapost the gung-ho language of Johnson. But itaposs still a far cry from when she wore a hat resembling an EU flag at the  State Opening of Parliament. So weaposve reproduced what she said, and had a stab at what it might mean.    The Queen opened her speech today by saying the governmentaposs priority has always been to leave the EU on October . My Government’s priority has always been to secure the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union on  October. My Government intends to work towards a new partnership with the European Union, based on free trade and friendly cooperation. What does the wording tell us   On the one hand, Boris Johnsonaposs inserted the October  date into the Queenaposs Speech. Some might see that as a provocative statement of intent. But on the other, what did she actually say  It turns out the Queen used much less firm wording on Brexit than everything . The rest of her speech is littered with firm promises in the present or future tense. My government will bring forward. My ministers will ensure. My government remains committed. But not the bit about Brexit. This was placed firmly in the past tense. And it didnapost promise to leave the EU on Halloween - instead saying it has been a priority. What brought on this sudden moderate language  Did the Monarch, weeks after she was politicised to unlawfully shut down Parliament, signal that she didnapost want to be seen to give a view on Brexit  Or did Downing Street act first - keeping the wording gentle to avoid infuriating the Palace  Without a view inside the secretive communications between No and Buckingham Palace, we canapost know for sure. But itaposs certainly interesting that the phrase was worded as it was. Downing Street refused to saythere was a conversation between No and the Palace about the phrase. But a spokesman said: “The language in the Queen’s Speech was the language suggested by the government.”    The last Queenaposs Speech in  didnapost go as far as todayaposs. It didnapost mention an exit date and merely spoke of securing the best possible deal. She also delivered it wearing a hat that resembled the EU flag. My government’s priority is to secure the best possible deal as the country leaves the European Union. My ministers are committed to working with Parliament, the devolved administrations, business and others to build the widest possible consensus on the country’s future outside the European Union.

Gemma Dobbing had been so focused on looking after her little boy Charlie, now three, that her diet spiralled out of control and she gorged on Chinese takeaways and chocolate bars. At her heaviest, the council worker weighed st and couldnapost bear to go on nights out with friends because she struggled to find clothes to fit her size  figure. But after booking her wedding in October  and finding the perfect dress, Gemma, , set herself the challenge of squeezing into the gown in less than a year. Two weeks ago she walked down the aisle to audible gasps from relatives who could hardly recognise her.  Gemma, from Newcastle, Tyne and Wear, said: Itaposs a massive achievement. I was so happy. When I bought my dream dress, it didnapost even fit. It didnapost close fully. I was a size  and it was size  - but it was the dress of my dreams. My mum said aposyou really shouldnapost do thisapos as I signed a waiver, confirming I was aware it didnapost fit when I bought it. Weaposd been storing the dress at my mother-in-lawaposs house for the last year, but eight weeks ago it went to the dressmaker for alterations. I was convinced it wasnapost going to fit. I panicked. When I put it the dress on it still didnapost fit - but this time it was too big! We had to take four and a half inches off the waist.  I hit my target three days before the wedding on September . I was a size eight and weighed just st lbs. Iaposd finally done it. After being with Alan for seven years, Gemma claims he never commented on her weight, but told her to do what she needed to do to feel good. But as he turned around to see her walking down the aisle, she claims he had a tear in his eye. For family members who lived further afield, it was the first time they had seen Gemma since her weight loss journey began and they gasped at her incredible transformation. Gemma said: A lot of my family live far away and they hadnapost seen me, so when I walked down the aisle you could hear people gasping. It made my day. It was amazing.  Alan had always just said to me to do what I want to do, but when he saw me on our wedding day, he had a tear in his eye and said I looked beautul and like a princess. Gemma had survived on a diet of chocolate and crisps for breakfast, fish and chips with bread for lunch and takeaways for dinner. And after a letime suffering with acute asthma, she realised her weight was making the condition worse - with medics even telling her to lose weight. The last straw came when Gemma looked at pictures of her little boyaposs birthday party and didnapost recognise herself. Gemma said: Friends would invite me on nights out and initially I would say yes, but then on the day I would change my mind. I didnapost have any clothes to fit me. I would just wear a baggy t-shirt or leggings. I suddenly didnapost like to go out.  I stopped going out and being myself because of my weight. I was already in ill health, including lung disease and acute asthma, and Iaposd been in critical care in hospital  times in a year. Iaposve always had bad lungs, but I think they struggled supporting me more when I was overweight. The respiratory nurses said I needed to lose weight, but I would think aposwho are they telling me to lose weight apos I had a party for my sonaposs second birthday in August last year, at Build a Bear Factory.I saw a photo of myself on Facebook with Charlie on my hip and I thought aposoh my god, is that really me aposBy that point, I felt ashamed of myself. I didnapost know how I could have let myself get like that. Just over a week later I joined Slimming World. Iaposve only been a member for just over a year. Iaposll never be cured of the asthma or lung disease, but I feel I can breathe more freely now.  After a month of following the plan religiously, the plus-size mum had already lost half a stone. She swapped last minute morning sugar for overnight oats with berries and her fatty chip suppers were swapped for healthy wraps or chicken and rice. Gemma said: I went to the first meeting and was like aposoh my god, how do I walk through that door myself apos But everyone was so supportive. Itaposs tough to keep going. I got bored of the same meals because I wasnapost mixing up the recipes and by December, I almost quit. My friend Bex joined too to give me motivation and I learnt to cook from fresh. There were points where my weight plateaued. I was trying so hard but for a few weeks I wouldnapost lose anything.

I kept retracting my steps and checking the toilets, lost property, asking behind the bar and looking around that exact spot where we was taking photos and I couldnapost find it at all! I probably spend most of my night trying to find it.    Becca kept telling me itaposs probably back at the hotel so thereaposs no point in worrying but all I could think about was how was I supposed to get home. Bobbie applied for an emergency passport on Friday, but had to wait another four days as the British consulate does not process documents at weekends - meaning she would miss herflight on Monday. She said: I was so scared I didnapost know how I was gonna manage on my own!

I’d just dropped off my son to school and I went back to the flat to get some papers for work that I had forgotten.  I heard a massive screeching of tyres and as I turned, the truck came hurtling towards me, pushing me straight through the window of the hotel. I blacked out and then woke up with the vehicle towering over me. A passer-by, who happened to be a nurse, sat with me until the emergency services arrived.

He said: It’s a been a long, hard struggle but, once I got my balance back and was able to walk using my new legs, le got better. I was determined. It took me about two years to walk properly again. I am still learning something new about being an amputee every day but there is no other choice but to get on with it.

Along with her crack team of fellow female runners she will cover  miles in five days, racking-up an average of  miles of running per day while ferry-hopping between the islands.  Allie hopes the project will help tackle the ‘female guilt’ many mums feel when they spend time away from their families. She said: “Many of the women I talk to don’t think they are strong enough, fast enough or fit enough to try an adventure race. They worry about holding the rest of the team back. “Female guilt plays a part - they don’t feel like they can take a small amount of time out away from their families to do something for themselves, something that will ultimately make them physically and mentally stronger, happier and more resilient. “I want to help encourage and inspire more women to get out and push their limits.” The team set out from Barra and will run to the Butt of Lewis via South Uist, Benbecula, North Uist, Harris and Lewis, finishing on October .    They will tackle mountains, beaches and peat bogs along the way. Allie Bailey, is -year-old freelance marketing manager who lives in Somerset  “Don’t celebrate the win, celebrate the experience. Allie, who took up running eight years ago. She was struggling with depression, and having tried to take her own le, a doctor recommended running as a means to lt the black cloud that hovered above her. Since , and on the back for a mental setback, Allie has undertaken some of the most demanding challenges the world has to offer. Last year she completed the first ever foot crossing of an uninhabited stretch of the Namib Desert, covering  miles in four days and ascending half the height of Everest. Just days after that feat, she and other Rat Race test pilots blazed a new coast-to-coast trail through the jungles of Panama, covering  miles - and , ft of ascent - in six days. Now she’s on a mission to convince more women they can follow in her muddy footsteps She said: “Every time I get to the airport, or the start line of a big race, I get the realisation that I am either the only woman there, or one of a small handful.    “It can be heartbreaking to think that there are people sat at home, wishing that they could do this stuff, but not having the confidence to give it a go. “I want to help those people realise their dreams. Rat Race is so inclusive in what they do, and encourage people from all walks of le to take part in. “They don’t celebrate the win, they celebrate the experience. I want women to be able to believe in more - to be able to see the world and come back empowered and confident. “I’m hoping between Ultra Awesome and Rat Race we can create a   gender split on the start lines of some amazing experiences.” And here are the other ordinary women taking on the extraordinary challenge.  Kim Hopkinson, is -year-old Senior Business Development Officer for charity Change, Grow, Live, and lives in Banbury, Oxfordshire, with husband Jack.  She said: “I want to leave this trip with the realisation that stuff like this is for ordinary people like me.” Kim only took up running four years ago.    But she has graduated from brief mile-and-a-half runs under the cover of darkness - to spare any blushes about her fitness levels - to marathon distances, including a  mile trek last year. She said: “Running is simple, but it’s also very visible when you’re a woman running on the streets. “So I would go out in the dark, in a million layers, on a quiet route from my house. “I always thought it was really long way but looking back it was quite short - around a mile and a half. “But just going out running a couple of times a week, you can improve so quickly. “This year I did London Marathon... and absolutely hated it. It was too busy, too loud, and I felt like just a number. I craved something dferent - and that’s where adventure racing has come in.” For Kim, camaraderie is key. She added: “It’s not a race, we’re all in this together. “And I want to leave this trip with the realisation that stuff like this is for ordinary people like me.” Gillian McColl, is -year-old director of an electrical contractor company from Kinross, Scotland, and a mum of two children - Adam, nine, and Alicia, eight.     She said: “I’m not selfish - time away on adventures makes me a happier person and a better mother.” Gillian is an experienced runner and has completed a number of marathons and ultras - but only really started running seriously in , having become a mother to two children in  and . In June this year she completed the The Spine Race, covering  miles, non-stop, in just  hours. And yet her passion for adventure running has seen her experiencing negative comments from school-run mums. She said: “I used to feel really guilty about going out for runs when I first started running again after becoming a mum, and that wasn’t helped by some of the comments I received from mums at the school gate. “I had one telling me, ‘you must be really selfish to take all that time out for yourself - do you not feel bad about that ’ “I was shocked, and found myself questioning, ‘Am I being selfish ’ “After some introspection I realised that running makes me a healthier, better person. I need time-out to clear my head and this makes me a better mum. “I don’t actually care what people think anymore, because this sport works for me and it works for my family.    “You can’t be a  hour-a-day mother. You have to have your own ‘thing’ - your stress release that helps you cope with the demands of work. “Besides, the children love telling their friends about events that I’m doing as they think the distances I run are a bit crazy.  “And I want them to see what is possible when you try and push yourself out of your comfort zone. If you had told me three years ago that I could have run a marathon never mind an ultra I think I would have laughed!” Laura Fisher, is a -year-old mother of three and lives near Faversham, Kent.  She said: “I grew up thinking I hated running.” Laura was another late starter - only getting into fitness five years ago. She loved boot-camp style classes - but always ‘hated’ running, viewing it as a ‘necessary evil’. But when she tried obstacle course racing, she caught the bug, and the running distances got longer and longer.    For Laura - mum to George , Margot  and Emmanuel nine - it’s the purity of the journey that holds so much appeal. She said: “Friends would talk about how wonderful running was, how it cleared the mind and helped them solve their day-to-day problems, but I never got that at all. I just used to think, ‘When can I stop ’ and, ‘Am I going to die ’. “But since realising that running was actually something I enjoy, Iaposve done countless obstacle and road races - everything from Km to marathon distance. “The unimportant, mundane things we all worry about in le start to fall away and I focus entirely on the journey.” Meanwhile Laura says running isn’t about getting the perfect body, either. She added: “I’m  and I run for fitness, yes, but my motivating factors are not to lose weight or achieve a certain body type – I’m far more interested in testing by body to see what I can achieve. A smaller waistline is an added bonus but not what gets me lacing up my running trainers. “I’m also determined to instil the idea in my kids thatyou really want something you can achieve it.    But to make this achievement you need to work - and that can be damn hard, simply wanting something is not enough.” Alice Kirk, is a -year-old psychotherapist who specialises in bereavement with couples and families, lives in rural Derbyshire, with her husband and three teenage daughters.  She said: “I don’t want to be an observer.” After losing her husband when she was , former marketing manager Alice retrained as a psychotherapist. And despite having been a runner most of her le, she only started taking on ‘ultra’ distances - anything more than a marathon in- around five years ago. She said: “After a dficult period in my le about five years ago, a conversation with an ultra runner encouraged me to seeI could go further and I entered my first ultra, January st . “Since then, I have taken part in thirty four ultra events.” For Alice, running takes her into an almost hypnotic, stress-free state, away from the dramas of everyday le. She added: “When you’re running, your brain becomes completely focused.  “It’s amplied when you’re covering long distances, too. You kind of go into this numb state, where the only thing you think about is the next checkpoint. “You’re completely separated from anything  that might be worrying you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles adorable moment baby","story":"NewsAdorable moment between Meghan Markle and baby Archie in intimate unseen clipA forthcoming ITV documentary called Harry and Meghan: An African Journey will look at their royal tour earlier this yearShareCommentsByTom DavidsonSenior Reporter:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror tv video trailer-meghan-harry-african-journey-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-markles-adorable-moment-baby-\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

At the time, Louise , from Waterhouses, in Staffordshire, didn’t think much of the unusual flavour of wine she had enjoyed after a family day out. But later that night, Louise, who was  at the time, awoke in the night with chest pains and was blue-lighted to hospital. The first sign that something wasn’t right was when I had a glass of wine and it tasted really funny, she said. My husband tried some too and said it was fine, so I didn’t think much of it. “That night, I woke up just after midnight with excruciating pain and pressure in my chest. At first I thought it might be indigestion but I quickly realised that something wasn’t right and my husband called an ambulance. When the paramedics arrived they said they thought I was having a heart attack. I looked at my husband and just started sobbing.    I guess I was in shock and my first thought was that I was going to die.”Louise had a stent fitted into her left coronary artery at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, Chronicle Live reports.She added: “As soon as the stent was put in place I immediately began to feel better. I couldn’t believe it was that quick. The surgeon said there is a second blockage in my other artery, but it’s not big enough to need a stent.” Now the mum of twin daughters is campaigning for women to look after their heart health from a young age - as she worries too often heart attacks are assumed to impact only men. The British Heart Foundation has launched a new briefing, revealing the inequalities in awareness, diagnosis and treatment of heart attacks killing women in the UK. In the North East alone, around , women are admitted to hospital following a heart attack each year, the BHF says. The charity estimates that around , women in the North East, like Louise, have survived a heart attack. The BHF says its new research shows women often delay seeking medical help by more than two hours, reducing their chance of survival. Speaking about the brewing symptoms, Louise, said: “Looking back at the week before I was really tired and working long hours and juggling le with the kids. Two nights after I got back from work I literally fell asleep on the sofa, which was really unusual for me. I thought I’d just hit a wall because of being a busy working mum – which I realise now is a typical female response. I had extreme tiredness before mine, but thought it was just because I was busy.” Now Louise is more conscious of how and what she eats. She has also been proactive in creating a healthier work-le balance by not overworking or committing to long hours. In a bid to educate her daughters, Louise confides in them about the reason they are going for a walk or doing sport. Worryingly, according to the BHF briefing, more than , women in England and Wales alone died over a -year period because they did not receive equal treatment to men.

But today, Kate and William went to his official resident to meet him in his new role, and it was likely a special moment for both men. Diana and Jemima became very closer when the princess started dating British-Pakistani heart surgeon Dr Hasnat Khan and fell madly in love.Dr Hasnat was a distant cousin of Imran Khan, and Diana would go to Jemima for advice on their relationship , especially relating to the cultural dferences.   Jemima converted to Islam before their wedding and they married in a short ceremony in Paris. They had two sons together, Sulaiman Isa and Kasim and the family set up home in Pakistan.

However he later claimed he got the impression she didn’t want to move there.    Dr Khan said when he discovered Diana had asked her butler Paul Burrell to find outthey could marry in secret, he thought the idea was “ridiculous”. “She just said everything would be all right,” he revealed. “That was her answer to everything – it will turn out all right.” But despite her royal status, Naheed Khan was unlikely to approve of her son marring an English woman.

Wallop. The offences happened on the day of the most recent Birmingham City v Aston Villa game, a Championship fixture which Villa won - at St Andrewaposs, with Grealish scoring the winner. Perkins had denied the charges but was convicted a trial. He appeared to smile as he looked at his phone as he walked away from the court later. The court heard Perkins, an accountancy and finance student at the University of Salford, had been drinking from am when he posted three tweets. The tirade of abuse came minutes after Grealish was attacked on the pitch by a fan who ran from the stands. One tweet showed a picture of the headstone of Grealishaposs brother, Keelan Grealish, who died in tragic circumstances as a baby. The text on the tweet said: He may have scored but will never bring his dead brother back and that brings me more satisfaction than anything  ever could.    Another tweet read: Grealish went down quicker than his brother got lowered into the grave. The third said: Whereaposs your brother gone  Come on! Simon Brownsey, prosecuting, told the court there was no dispute that Perkins sent the tweets but the court had to decide whether they would be judged grossly offensive by any reasonable member of society. John McGregor, defending, said Perkins accepted the comments expressed in the tweets were sick and he had not tried to hide them. But he said it fell to the court to be the moral arbiter of what was said. Perkins, of Chelmsley Wood in the west Midlands, was arrested on March  and told police he had been encouraged to post the tweets by those around him at the game. He said he had drunk nine pints of lager - starting at am on the day of the noon kick-off. But he told the court his actions had been wrong and he had great respect for Grealish, who he described as a great footballer. Perkins said he had not intended to offend the footballer and had not sent the tweets to him or tagged him in them. He said he had been banned from Blues matches for le and had written to Grealish to apologise.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe end of a first date can be an awkward affair when the bill lands on the table. You both attempt to work out how it will be paid using eye contact only to avoid having the conversation and bringing an awkward end to the night. However, an author and model has made her feelings on the issue very clear by warning men thatthey expect her to split the bill, they simply wonapost be seeing her again.Writing an opinion article on SHESAID , the siteaposs dating expert Peta Serras explains why the expectation of splitting the bill is a bad omen in a piece titled aposI’m just going to say it – guys who split the bill on dates are d*****bagsapos.   Peta says: Splitting the bill on dates sets the precedent for a relationship, one where everything is straight down the middle. And where does that end  Does that mean we should keep monthly spreadsheets and document when we give sexual favors and how much we give emotionally to ensure we’re even every month  She explains she had never given much thought to aposgoing Dutchapos until a promising first date quickly took a nosee when it came time to pay and she got the expectant look. Every date which followed ended the same way, with the man expecting Peta to pay her way aposdespite the large pay gap due to his generous salaryapos. She says she has no aversion to funding her own expenses but wasnapost happy that he insisted on a   split despite her being the one who had travelled due to living out of town. Her suggestions of alternating payment instead was brushed off and the final straw came when he asked her to cough up £. for coffee after she had driven  minutes to see him.She argues: People always misread me on this topic call me a gold digger or a princess, but it’s not actually even about the money, it’s about what the money  signies.    And as it turned out with my demanding date, perhaps unsurprisingly, his money wasn’t the only thing he was stingy with.It was this relationship that made me value generosity and really see that some men use the excuse of splitting the bill to hide their stinginess. The conversation was sparked in Petaaposs friendship group when a girlfriend of hers went on a date with a man who took her to one of the apospriciest venues in townapos. She says the man was bragging about his pay packet and insisted on picking from the menu for his date, choosing expensive dishes and pricey wine - before asking to split the painfully large bill at the end. The group debated whether itaposs still possible to call yourself a feminist while accepting a free meal from a date. After all,we want equal rights, we should be prepared to split the bill equally, right  wrote Peta. I believe you can still consider yourself a feminist and accept a nice meal from someone. And conversely, you can also be a feminist and buy someone  a meal, too. It’s when someone uses that term as an excuse to be stingy with their funds that isn’t cool with me, as I feel it says a lot about that person’s character.  Let me be clear on this:I ask a guy out and go to the effort of arranging the date, then I expect to foot the bill for the whole date. She finishes by saying that she believes everyone needs to have standards in dating and relationships, and one of her rules is now not to date a aposstingyapos man who wants to split the bill. ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\""},{"url":null,"title":"man whose hand severed meat","story":"NewsMan whose hand was severed by meat slicer wriggles fingers one day after surgeryWARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES - Surgeons in Brisbane, Australia, performed the rare painstaking seven-hour operation on factory worker Lawrence CooperShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video surgeons-successfully-re-attach-mans-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news man-whose-hand-severed-meat-\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

The seven-and-half hour surgery was such a success that Lawrence Cooper was able to wriggle his fingers the next day. Eight weeks on and the -year-old factory worker has regained feeling in his entire hand. Lawrence was operating the meat slicer at work when he accidentally severed his hand below the thumb. A quick-thinking colleague grabbed the severed hand, placed it in ice and applied a tourniquet to Lawrenceaposs arm. Thanks to his co-worker, Lawrence could undergo surgery to save his hand following the traumatic accident in August.    Lawrence was rushed to Mater Private Hospital in Brisbane, Australia, where plastic and reconstructive surgeons formed two teams that battled to save his hand.Surgeon Theo Birch told ABC News : Before we could even consider reattachment we had to establishwe could reconnect the blood supply to the severed hand within a viable timeframe.Lawrenceaposs amputation was clean and sharp and there were no jagged bones which made the reattachment a smoother process. Dr Birch and his colleague Andrew Hadj worked to clean and prepare the site before spending seven hours performing the microsurgery. They started from the inside out and their first action was to stabilise the bone.    They both then ascertained which blood vessels were viable before starting the meticulous process.Dr Birch told news : We were under the microscope with very, very high magnication and suturing those vessels back together with tiny sutures you canapost see to the naked eye.Unfortunately you canapost just connect an artery together straight away to restore blood flow as the construct is too flimsy. You need to plate and screw the bones together, repair the deeper tendons — only then is it safe to focus on the fine microvascular surgery. Because the reattachment of an entire hand is rare the medics carefully monitored Lawrence for several hours after the operation.  If any of those blood vessels get a small clot or thrombus in it, then the whole circulation goes off, Dr Birch said.  The following day Lawrence was able to move his fingers and although it will be a very slow progress the outlook is positive. Medics say his hand will neverto normal but believe it will be al.  Recalling the accident, Lawrence said: It was pretty terrying when you see your hand missing.  "},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5da58524175958.55625050-682x564.jpg ","title":"bbc documentary examines the deep scars left from dundee timex closure 26 years on","story":"Snarling faces twisted with hate scream abuse at the bus windows.And inside the double-deckers, huddled together, are the “scab” workers with heads bowed and wrapped in jacket hoods to hide their faces.Several even drop to the floor to avoid being recognised.The scene is more than  years ago outside Dundee’s Timex factory but the scars still run deep in the city, as BBC Scotland reveals tonight in a documentary examining the dispute.The programme – to be screened on the BBC Scotland digital channel at pm – features a host of former workers and union officials recalling their bitter battle with management which eventually led to the company closing the business.The BBC describes the industrial dispute as the “last full-blooded strike in Scotland” and it features as the first in a series of programmes about protests.Former Timex employee Wendy Cobb, who now works as a barmaid in Harlequins, said: “The BBC interviewed a lot of us for the programme and we are all quite excited to see it.“The feelings are still as strong today as they were back in the s and I am sure that will come across.”Memories of Dundee Timex factory to be brought back to le\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp memories-of-dundee-timex-factory-to-be-brought-back-to-le embed # secretulnQpvnSvQ\" data-secret\"ulnQpvnSvQ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Wendy said that although people remember the battles between police and picket line protesters, initially there was a lot of good humour.She added: “The cops would actually bring us coffee and pies when they were paid.

To score on my debut at Hampden is something I’ve dreamt of as a little boy so it’s a really special moment for me.“I’ve looked up and seen my mum and dad in the stand for the national anthem and that’s a moment I’ve been able to savour forever.“But the most important thing was we knew we had a game to play and I know it’s a game we’re expected to win.

up at the break, while there were also goals for substitute Stuart Armstrong and home debutant Shankland in the second half of the Euro  qualying Group I fixture.Findlay said it was a special night for both him and Dundee United striker Shankland, who he has known since childhood.He added: “I’ve known Lawrence from when we were little boys, we used to play against each other aged eight and nine so I’ve known him all the way through.“I was over the moon to see him score and then to get one myself was a really special moment for the two of us.“We might not have been involved at this level not very long so it just shows you how quickly football can turn and I’m delighted for Lawrence.“Just to get your first cap anywhere is incredible but to do it at Hampden is just something you dream of when you’re growing up and it’s something I’ll always remember.”The victory saw Scotland move up one place in Group I, above Kazakhstan to within a point of third-placed Cyprus with two matches remaining.Clarke’s side face that pair next month."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

It’s not like a formal job interview so participants learn how to tackle face-to-face conversations without feeling pressure.“I start by asking them what they want to achieve, and the response can be anything from ‘I want a job in this particular field’ to ‘I want to improve my CV’. Then we see how we can best help. We can either suggest something that can improve their employment prospects or signpost them to someone  who can.”Barnardo’s can enrol people on to schemes such as the Barnardo’s Works Best programme, in which participants earn qualications, gain work experience, try volunteering and add handy skills to their CV, such as first aid.On the day, one of the participants who wants to be a mechanic applied to join the Army.Regimental support worker Phil Carradice said: “It has been really beneficial for us to attend and we feel that we’re able to tell young people about everything the Army officers do in a comfortable setting.“For example,someone is looking to become a mechanic, we can offer training where people are paid more than £, and that rises to £, after it finishes.“Joining the Armed Forces opens up a whole world and people broaden their horizons, and they can move on to pastures new in four years and apply the skills they have learned in a related field.”Callum Boyle was one of those who took part in the workshop.The -year-old, of Kintore, said: “I am really glad I came along, it’s been really interesting to meet people from dferent organisations.“I would like an apprenticeship in admin work so I can work in an office. I’m not sure what I want to do beyond that but today has given me more ideas to think about.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45352657-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45352657-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45352657-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45352657-2-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"charlie house thanks aberdeen public for charity cafe support","story":"A children#s charity has praised the “overwhelming support” it has received for its ReCHarge Cafe.Charlie House, which supports children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions, opened the eatery in the Bon Accord centre in April.All profits from the venture go towards its Big Build Appeal, an £ million specialist support centre that will be located at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen.Susan Crighton, director of fundraising at Charlie House, said: “We can’t believe it has been six months since we first opened the doors at ReCHarge Cafe.“We have been overwhelmed with the support from the people of the north-east and would like to thank each and every customer whose snack, tea break or lunch purchase has gone on to support local families.“Every penny of profit supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions, and their families in the north-east of Scotland.”The cafe has benefited from a range of dferent businesses across the city supporting the venture.How you can donate to Charlie House#s Big Build Appeal\" src\"https:www.eveningexpress fp news local how-you-can-donate-to-charlie-houses-big-build-appeal embed # secretWNcnUfbxmK\" data-secret\"WNcnUfbxmK\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"It runs on a pay-what- you-want service based on what customers believe refreshments are worth and has been fitted out with a range of dferent facilities.It also has an accessible toilet, complete with a hoist, so families with children of any age can comfortably use the equipment.Susan added: “We could not have progressed with this project without the unwavering support of the Bon Accord team – from management to operations and facilities, the team have been incredible.“We also have to highlight the amazing local businesses which have supported us – from kitchen fitters to flooring companies to signage and local painters and decorators.“These incredible organisations have gted us over £, worth of services – this has included gts in kind and man hours.“A final and special thanks must go out to our regular volunteers who work with the staff at the cafe, some committing several days a week, to support the cafe and its customers.“We look forward to serving many more customers.”CHARLIE House is hoping to raise £ million for its Big Build Appeal to construct and maintain a specialist support centre.A whopping £m of the funds has already been secured through generous supporters.Now a public fundraising campaign has been launched, to which you can donate to help Charlie House’s vision become a reality.Visit bit.ly ROBktF or call  ."},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/5da549d74db097.19845128-423x564.jpg ","title":"india ms treatment gives north east mum chance have life again","story":"A multiple sclerosis sufferer today said she has the chance to “have a le again” after receiving treatment in India.Maggie Conner’s family put all their efforts into raising cash so the mum-of-two could receive stem cell treatment in a bid to stop the rapid progression of her MS.The -year-old had been due to travel to Mexico to undergo the potentially le-changing treatment but it was proving too expensive, at a cost of around , .Instead, the family looked to India, with Maggie travelling to a bone marrow transplant unit in New Delhi in August and ing last month, after receiving  days of treatment.She said: “I was due to go to Mexico but I couldn’t afford it.“It cost , to get the treatment in India so it was drastically cheaper.“My mum, Louise, came with me for emotional support.“It was my only hope to stop the MS.”The process involves the removal of stem cells from the bone marrow which are then treated and stored. vw, px\"  In the meantime, patients have chemotherapy to kill off the immune system, then the treated cells are reintroduced with the aim that the body will regenerate a new immune system.Maggie, who is married to Paul, , and mum to daughters Megan, , and Leah, , had to leave her family behind for the duration of her trip and was confined to her hospital room while she went through treatment.

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert! How is it that I had never even heard of that curious little bay. There it lay, calm and silvery, like a scene from a theatre. A striking and beautul spot.#In the modern era, many thousands of tourists visit Tarbert each year.

Around  resident berth holders and more than , visiting leisure craft during the sailing season add considerably to the numbers who arrive at Tarbert and appreciate the attractive surroundings.The present plans for the power line, however, as exhibited by SSEN, will present a view on entering the harbour despoiled by a line of monster pylons.The current proposal suggests that four or five of the -foot pylons will dominate the western skyline. The visual impact of this scheme as presently proposed will have a negative effect on the experience of everyone who lives in, or visits, Tarbert.Tarbert was designated as a conservation area in the s.

The group, the Mull of Kintyre Milk Supply Cooperative, will fund the purchase through use of a levy from every litre of milk produced, in addition to external funding which is currently being sought.A key element of the funding is the launch of the crowdfunding campaign which seeks to raise £, towards the purchase. The group is encouraging the local community, foodies, suppliers, customers, businesses and anyone with a love of cheese to contribute and further information can be found at www.crowdfunder mokcheddarIn  First Milk, a British farmer-owned dairy co-operative, announced plans to sell Campbeltown Creamery as part of a move away from smaller-scale brands.

Given the challenges of sustaining a vibrant economy in this remote part of Scotland, the role of the dairy sector in Kintyre is fundamental to its success.#Our farmers are young, enthusiastic, committed to sustainability, investment and the next generation and have strong integrity – they are just the right group of people to secure this deal.#We have produced a great video which shows just why the Campbeltown Creamery is so pivotal to the area and why Mull of Kintyre cheddar is so important to Scotland and I encourage everyone to please support us by heading to the crowdfund website and spreading the word.#NFU Scotland Milk Committee Chairman John Smith commented: #This is a bold and inspiring bid from producers in Kintyre to preserve their creamery and to continue making world-famous, award-winning Mull of Kintyre cheddar.#These hard working family farms have built their businesses with a view to continuing to milk cows building and promoting the Mull of Kintyre brand locally and nationally and are looking positively to the future.#Dairy farmers in Kintyre have a fantastic story to tell,  producing high quality grass-fed milk in a beautul part of the country.  Funders will take the Mull of Kintyre brand to the next level by getting behind a cheese that has real provenance.#"},{"url":null,"title":"oban camanachd defeat seals relegation for inveraray","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsInveraray lost out to the Camanachd Cup finalists at Mossfield # a result which means the Royal Burgh side will be playing its shinty in the National Division next season.In goal for Inveraray for the match on Saturday October , Scott MacLachlan was on form and he denied Oban Camanachd#s Daniel MacCuish, Daniel MacVicar and Andrew MacCuish, before play switched to the other end and it was Inveraray who took the lead on  minutes.

These are big, old oaks.Appearing in support of the application, Gavin Yuill, of Galashiels-based Camerons Architects, said: ldquoIn relation to the design and placemaking, the one-and-a-half storey houses proposed are the most common house type in the rural Scottish Borders and in Minto village.ldquoThe two nearest neighbouring houses are both one-and-a-half storey, the set back of both proposed houses is consistent with the street and the stone, wet dash rendered walls, timber cladding, timber windows and doors, natural slate roofs and metal gutters are all consistent with the high-quality materials used in traditional Minto village.ldquoThe overwhelming number of retained trees, the replacement of all lost trees, and substantial new screen and hedge planting will reinforce the existing habitats and ensure that the bioersity is maximised.ldquoThese are demonstrated by the proposed landscaping drawings provided with the application.Also appearing in support of the applicant was Tim Ferguson, of Galashiels-based Ferguson Planning.He told the committee: ldquoA review of the housing analysis into the forthcoming local development plan again shows the signicant benefits windfall sites of this nature can have in meeting housing delivery targets.ldquoThe delivery of the annual housing targets are short of where they require to be and thusproposals of this nature will assist in meeting local needs.ldquoA signicant amount of housing within the Scottish Borders is met via small developments and self-build and indeed has occurred where within the confines of Mintorsquos settlement.ldquoThis subject site falls within the settlement boundary of Minto and is clearly in compliance with related planning policy principles and which has no defined restrictions upon it.Councillors also heard that planning officers are recommending the application be approved, subject to conditions.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison said: ldquoMuch is made by the objectors that the buildings are not in keeping with Minto, yet the report from officers says that there are no two buildings the same in the village.ldquoTo be honest, they look okay to me but Irsquod need to see them in the context of what is already there.ldquoThe houses already there donrsquot look hugely architecturally important to me but perhaps Irsquom a Philistine.Members of the committee agreed to conduct a site visit, and to reconsider the application at the next meeting of the planning and building standards committee, which is due to meet on Monday, November ."},{"url":null,"title":"planned-early-years-centre-given-go-ahead","story":"COUNCIL planners have approved proposals to extend St Ronanrsquos Primary School in Innerleithen.Scottish Borders Council wants to construct a single-storey extension on the school, in order to meet demand generated by the Scottish Governmentrsquos decision to increase entitlement to free early learning and childcare provision.The new space will cater for  children, with  spaces allocated to two to three year olds, and  space set aside for three to five year olds.The plans will also see the relocation of the existing play area, a pumping station and water tank, and fenced nursery garden.A design statement, submitted by the councilrsquos in-house architect, reads: ldquoAccessibility and inclusivity have been a key focus during the design development.ldquoThe provision will be universally accessible and will offer a high-quality learning environment for the children and teaching staff.ldquoThe proposal has been developed to meet current and future teaching with the primary focus being on teaching spaces that are flexible and adaptive to cater for a iety of needs and learning experiences.ldquoThe design ethos has been simplied to provide a hierarchy of spaces from the two to three year oldrsquos playroom up to the three to five year oldrsquos playrooms with intermittent shared activity spaces in-between.ldquoLarge bi-folding doors within the play areas creates easy passage between the indoors and outdoors, encouraging independence and providing additional learning opportunities.ldquoA large canopy running theof the building strengthens the pedagogy of a seamless transition between the spaces and enables children to stay outdoors in wet weather conditions.ldquoFurthermore, it minimises solar gain during sunny weather.

He said: \"My initial concept was to produce a comparatively modest format, aimed at the photographically conscious visitor.\"By good fortune however, in engaging with Gerda as co-author, the scope and spirit of the work has been widened and deepened.\"The poems featured in this book have interacted with my images penetrating the veneer that can often dominate the city.\"All those prestigious castings and fine masonry may, collectively, have created one of Europersquos most beautul cities, but there were struggles in its making, and so often a human price was paid.\"I hope, therefore, it proves thought provoking at the very least.Gerda, who is an award-winning actor, songwriter and director as well as a writer, added: \"This has been a fascinating and welcome collaboration ndash an

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-embezzlers-sentence-deferred-tries-sell-faside-castle","story":"Ian Brash, , stole more than pound, from the student charity the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust while he was a trustee of the organisation.He pleaded guilty to the offence at a court hearing last year and is awaiting sentencing.The hold-up in the case has been Brashrsquos inability to sell the listed castle on the outskirts of Tranent so he can pay the charity back before sentence is passed.But last Friday, Edinburgh Sherf Court was told that the sale of the castle, currently on the market for offers over pound.m, had still not materialised.Sherf Frank Crowe was also told that the forensic accountant employed by the Crown to go through all Brashrsquos finances had taken ill and would need replaced.Sherf Crowe allowed the Crown motion to further defer sentence to allow them more time to delve into Brashrsquos finances.The case will now call again for sentencing on November .Brash pleaded guilty last year to embezzling pound, from the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust charity between August , , and September , .The father-of-two is currently selling the historic Category A-Listed Farsquoside Castle, a th-century four-storey castle with six bedrooms, four reception rooms and a great hall, through a leading Edinburgh estate agent for offers over pound. million."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

An assiduous promoter of gender equality, Professor Belch pointed out that despite the wealth of opportunities open to women in medicine, when it comes to the most prestigious areas, such as heart surgery, men are still top dog.ldquoThese are jobs where you may be required to work from six in the morning to  at night, she said, ldquoand most women decided that they prefer to work part-time rather than commit to that. Not that she blames them: ldquoAfter all, we fought for their right to choose.Part-time employment is now the main obstacle in the campaign for women to be on a par with men. When a female doctor first hooks a stethoscope around her neck the future looks,not precisely plain sailing, then navigable.However,at some point she starts a family, or has older relatives to care for, opting to work part-time creates an unsolvable quandary. You could call the shorter working week a womanrsquos wrecking ball, the destroyer of youthful aspirations.Speak to thirtysomething medics, who started out intending to become heroic surgeons and physicians, and you will detect a weariness, and also a resignation to the fact that the conditions in which they are expected to perform are incompatible with any kind of normal le, let alone raising a family.As a result, an essential tier of the health system voluntarily removes itself from the full-time rota. And while hospital-based medicine is undoubtedly at the extreme end of professional expectations, given the prolonged, intense and erratic shts, what goes for medicine is also true of other careers: the advocate who must work into the small hours and over weekends to keep on top of her case load the head teacher who is in the school before breakfast, and once back home works until bedtime the farmer who labours every day of the year the journalist who cannot clock off until the late-breaking story is filed.No wonder people in these occupations wondertheyrsquove been put on the rack, as they are slowly stretched to breaking point. Yet when doctors, and other high-fliers, decide to go part-time, it is a self-inflicted slow puncture. All the training, expertise and experience they have acquired, all the momentum they have gathered, begins to deflate. Friends and family feel secretly disappointed that a seemingly stellar career has lost its stardust. Worse, the part-timer often feels she is in some unfathomable way to blame for not being able to juggle everybodyrsquos expectations, including her own, yet still have a le worth living.By drawing attention to the part-time glass ceiling, Professor Belch highlights how complicated and protracted the business of reaching true equality remains. The effort to increase the number of women entering medical school, which was once seen as the solution to the predominance of males, succeeded years ago. Indeed, that hurdle has been so successfully overcome there are sometimes more girls in class than boys.The problem is that, in the early years of feminism, none of us looked far enough ahead. Lacking imagination, perhaps, or brimming with optimism, we did not give a thought to the lelong path ndash more accurately a tight-rope ndash on which working women must keep their balance. Once aloft, they need to stay upright not merely when they are young and full of energy, but as their lestyles change, their commitments grow, and their attitudes mature.Belchrsquos comments are a long overdue corrective to the notion that the ward ndash or boardroom, laboratory, lecture hall ndash is as welcoming for women as men. In so doing she has also pointed to the unrealistically tough regime in which many professionals are expected to survive. Itrsquos not just women who have a family to raise, or other caring responsibilities, and itrsquos not just women who feel they must clone themselves in order to get through everything the working day ndash and the action-packed weekend ndash demands. Singletons, or those with partners but no children, can still find employersrsquo expectations excessive and debilitating. The dedication and single-eyed focus required to keep on top of the most responsible roles takes a toll on everyone.Doubtless burn-out existed in Edwardian times, it just didnrsquot have a label. Today we have inherited a pitiless culture in which status is calculated by how visibly gruelling your job is. The more punishing your hours and the less time you have at home, the higher your place on the ladder of awe. The employee who can be home shortly after five, and has all evening in which to help their kids with homework or go to the gym, is unlikely to score impressively on the Richter scale of professional achievement. Yet she, or he, might have a really well thought-out le, with their priorities in the right order.The dilemma facing society is not simply how to help part-time women reach the very top but how to recalibrate these Alpha workplaces. The challenge for employers who do not want talented staff to drt off or grow disheartened is to come up with ways to make these all-consuming roles desirable, but also manageable, for a far wider range of iniduals.At the moment, physical and psychological stamina are almost as essential as professional excellence for someone to thrive in such an environment. Yet how many does that automatically exclude  Instead of a place that resembles the trenches, we need to restructure hospitals, banks, or the courts, so that they properly value ambitious and able part-timers. Far from discriminating against their promotion, they should encourage it. A good place to start might be to banish the adjective ldquopart-time, and its belittling connotations, once and for all."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Sturgeon is spot on   MPs should bin Boris and his dodgy deal","story":"ldquoIf you donrsquot give us what we want wersquoll be very, very naughty! screamed the memo, which outlined the ways in which the UK would seek to punish EU states that agreed to give the UK an extension, should a deal not be reached by October .

Why would they  Ms Sturgeon has been consistent from the outset: her party will not vote for any deal that takes Scotland and the UK out of the single market and customs union, causing untold damage to the Scottish economy. And since the current prime minister favours a harder, more isolationist and ideologically right-wing Brexit than even that fashioned by Mrs May, it is surely incumbent upon all UK opposition parties to fight tooth and nail to save the country from such a disastrous and isive path.Thatrsquos why they have no option but to vote down Mr Johnsonrsquos deal and force a general election, the circumstances of which will be vital in determining how it can be framed. After all, itrsquos not just Mr Johnsonrsquos tenure that must be keep short, but his list of options.The Lib Dems under Jo Swinson wonrsquot vote for any deal, not least because ldquogetting Brexit done would render their new \"stop Brexit altogether\" mandate redundant. And though itrsquos perhaps inevitable that some of the rebel Tories sitting on opposition benches might end up voting for the PMrsquos dealothers might decide to stick it to their former party and put the interests of the country first, especially since they are likely to lose their jobs anyway.

It would be a cruel but perhaps not unexpected ironyLabour enabled a devastating hard Brexit to be foisted upon our poorest people.There is, as yet, no deal to put to parliament.

We looked at a wide range of things ndash infrastructure, communities, housing being some examples.ldquoWe realised very quickly that the biggest problem facing the island was housing and it had to be fixed before everything . Therersquos simply just not enough housing for people who are working normal jobs and we are talking about the whole spectrum of things you need for a community ndash from doctors and teachers to care workers and cleaners.At  per cent Arran has one of the highest rates of housing used for holiday or second homes in the UK, second only to St Ives in Cornwall, where one-quarter of properties are holiday homes.The average house price is pound,, while the average wage is only pound,. The AEG estimates that earnings of pound, are required to get on the housing ladder.A study carried out by the group warns that the lack of housing for workers will have serious impacts on the islandrsquos population as time goes on, with  jobs being lost due to lack of affordable accommodation each year with a pound.m loss to the local economy.After  years,things remain as they are, the employment impacts are expected to have risen to  jobs lost and a pound.m shortfall per annum.Ms Borthwick added: ldquoThere are job vacancies right across the island we canrsquot fill because therersquos nowhere for them to stay. What we want to do is build houses that people want to live in. North Ayrshire Council ndash the local authority for Arran ndash is also building new homes on the island to try to alleviate the problem.Councillor Jim Montgomerie, Cabinet Member for Place, said the signicant growth in the short-term lets market was causing particular problems.He added: ldquoWe know that second homes have an inflationary effect on housing markets, and this effect has been magnied on Arran where increasing access to affordable housing is particularly challenging because of land availability, land values, and high construction costs. We are preparing to begin construction of  new council homes on the island and while this new development wonrsquot eliminate the problem, it will be an important step towards addressing the issue."},{"url":null,"title":"snp-dissidents-keep-faith-leader","story":"One thing we can be certain of is that the vote to leave the EU fundamentally changed our expectations and perceptions of politicians. We both revere and vily them as never before.In using legal prowess to cut a path through the arcane procedures of the House of Commons, Dominic Grieve and Joanna Cherry have emerged as unlikely heroes ndash or baddies, depending on your perspective. A recent poll for Sky News showed that only one in seven people trust Parliament on Brexit.That lack of trust cannot be separated from the widespread perception that the public are not being told the full story ndash or even the synopsis ndash from those in power. As ldquoDowning Street sourcesrsquorsquo release briefing and counter-briefing ndash often contrary to Government policy ndash the effect is a dizzying upending of reality.Will they do what they say they will, and do they even want to As we pin our hopes on the wisdom of our elected representatives while also doubting their intentions, the cracks in the pillars of our democracy worsen.It looks a lot like the rules have changed, and that the conventions that previously governed the honesty of politics have been gradually eroded.One politician who has emerged relatively unscathed from the Brexit process thus far is Nicola Sturgeon. Ironically, her greatest political challenges at present come not from the electorate, but from critics within her own party.There is internal stre over her approach to a second independence referendum, tensions which have been exasperated with every juddering lurch of the Brexit crisis. The constant ticking of the countdown clock, as we have edged nearer to each deadline in the Article  process, has ramped up the disgruntlement and impatience within the SNP.As Ms Sturgeon took to the airwaves for a mammoth media round on the second day of SNP conference on Monday, she set out her short and long-term priorities on Brexit and independence.She wants to see Boris Johnson fulfil the obligations placed upon him by the Benn Act to request a three-month extensionParliament hasnrsquot passed his deal ndash or given its support for no-deal ndash by October . It is her hope that the opposition parties will manage to get their act together and that a General Election will follow soon after.She also confirmed that indyref will be ldquofront and centrersquorsquo in the SNPrsquos campaign in the upcoming General Election. With the SNP projected to win the most seats in Scotland, she hopes the momentum is with her party to negotiate over holding another vote.Her strategy relies on Labour forming a minority government with the support of opposition parties. The price of the SNPrsquos support will be for prime minister Jeremy Corbyn to grant a Section  order so a referendum can be held.However, there is a widespread expectation that any such request would be refused, either by an emboldened Mr Johnson ed as prime minister with a majority ndash or a witless Mr Corbyn who refuses to give ground to earn the SNPrsquos support. If that scenario materialises, the undercurrent of party dissent could threaten to burst its banks.:Andy Maciver: Scottish independence is inevitable  Im not so sureA ldquoPlan B to counteract this, supported by SNP councillor Chris McEleny and others, would see a pro-independence majority at the next election being taken as a mandate to enter straight into independence negotiations with the UK government.Ms Sturgeon holds no truck for this muddy proposal, or indeed any deviation from the ldquogold-standardrsquorsquo route to independence that was pursued in . In one interview recently she pointed out that the Westminster voting system makes it possible for the SNP to win the most seats in Scotland, but on a minority of votes. In an age of relentless spin and endless loophole-searching to rig the system, her candour was refreshing.Lets not forget the catalyst for the runaway train of crisis we have seen since  was a leader ndash in David Cameron ndash who bowed to pressure from a minority in his party to seek an answer to a question that, at the time, very few were asking.It is easy to see why the naturally-cautious Ms Sturgeon would want to avoid the legal and constitutional headache that Plan B would bring.She believes that the knee-jerk refusal from Unionist parties to allow a second independence referendum is untenable and that it would be a democratic outrage for Westminster parties of any colour to deny Scotland the right to have a say on its future. While compelling, this argument does rely heavily on the politics of yesteryear: where manesto commitments and election victories meant something, and political reality had an impact on events. In the Brexit Britain of today, it is unlikely that a desire to be ndash or be seen to be ndash fair and reasonable will be enough to compel Mr Johnson or Mr Corbyn to concede to the SNPrsquos demands.But Ms Sturgeon is an experienced political operator and it is inconceivable that she will not have planned for that eventuality. Perhaps too quietly for some, perhaps in too guarded a manner to quell the disquiet from her party, but she will have planned nonetheless.:Nicola Sturgeon in row over unofficial email accountGiven that, it would have been wise of her critics to wait at least until that key moment before declaring that they had lost faith in her ability to secure a second referendum.If some in the SNP got their way, theyrsquod have her abandon moderation and diplomacy during the Brexit crisis. After all, Mr Johnson fights dirty, so why shouldnrsquot she Some may see her unwillingness to play the game under the new, gloves-off, Brexit rules as weakness. Others now question whether she really wants independence at all. In doing so they undermine one of their partyrsquos greatest assets ndash a leader who hasnrsquot lost a sense of perspective and public duty.You get the sense that a chunk of SNP supporters long for the bombastic days of Alex Salmond, believing that in the current political climate, bullishness and bul***t is power. They should be careful what they wish for.When the time comes for Scotland to decide its future, voters will be asked to put their trust in the arguments made by politicians. Having a leader who still plays by the rules and isnrsquot prone to party-political flights of fancy will be an asset for the campaign.For that reason, MsSturgeonrsquos critics should be wary of deciding that their captain is a dud or declaring the game over before it has even begun."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-danny-bouyant","story":"STRANGE entities have been glimpsed in a Glasgow city centre store.

No thanks.Why find space in onersquos busy schedule for hard labour when for a mere pound. you can have five men clean your car til its glinting Well, becauseit seems too good to be true then itrsquos likely to be too good to be true.More likely, a pound. car wash means those five people are being exploited as cheap labour. Possibly they are victims of modern slavery, perhaps they have been trafficked.But, given the proleration of hand car washes and the queues at them daily - and nightly, many of the car washes are open long hours - this fact is obviously easy enough for people to turn a blind eye to.Itrsquos interesting that modern day slavery has entered the public consciousness with regards to the clothing industry. We know quite well that our cheap clothes - the pound. swimsuit, the pound pair of jeans - come at a price that is far from economic. There is shock when big name, reputable brands are found to be churning out clothes in factories where workers are paid p an hour to toil in squalid conditions.Boycott, comes the cry.Just yesterday an exposeacute in thenewspaper alleged that workers in a factory making clothing for the high end active wear brand Lululemon are being subjected to cruel treatment - beatings, verbal abuse and pressure to work overtime. They are paid, it is claimed, around pound a month, which is less than the cost of one pair of Lululemon leggings.The company has said it will launch an immediate investigation, no doubt acting swtly and sharply because it knows the gross ill treatment of Bangladeshi female factory workers will play extremely badly with its middle class, socially aware customer base. Will boycott become the cry for Lululemon Yet when poor working conditions exist on our doorstep, we somehow find it easier to overlook.Nail bars are another consumer convenience where modern day slavery prolerates. They satisfy the desire for a bargain, make you feel good and therersquos no inconvenience of having to book ahead for an appointment. In the current financial climate, women have less money to spend on beauty treats and so something like a regular manicure is an addictive temptation for some.But is it ethical to continue to go to a nail baryou believe you may be participating in exploitation  Itrsquos easy for me to ask: the one and only time Irsquove set foot in a nail bar was accompanying a Police Scotland operation on human trafficking. If I was a woman keen on regular manicures and pedicures, would I be, as with the car washes, uncomfortable but still settling down for a file and polish The restructuring of how we shop has created an environment in which it is easy for exploitation to go unchecked. As with nail bars satisfying the need for a quick, cheap treatment, petrol stations are under pressure as consumers find it more convenient to fill up at supermarket petrol pumps rather than make two journeys to two locations.This means a decrease in the number of mechanical car washes and an increase in vacant space to be taken over by... exploitative hand car washes. Which is not to say that all car washes are exploitative. The UK body the Car Wash Advisory Service has an accreditation scheme, WashMark, that drivers can look out for.Drivers and nail bar customers can also easily look out for the signs of exploitation: workers who canrsquot communicate with customers in English, where the staff appear withdrawn or very young, where they are living in houses of multiple occupancy.A high profile court case last week saw four members of a gang found guilty of trafficking young Roma women and girls from Slovakia to Govanhill, to flats just a couple of streets away from where I live. One of the young women was sold into a sham marriage for pound, outside a branch of Primark in Glasgow city centre. The story captured readers in high numbers, likely from the shock of having such a heinous crime against such a familiar background.Yet exploitation is happening all around us and it needs consumers to be alert to the issue in order to tackle it.The Scottish Government commissioned a public survey this year on public responses to human trafficking. It found that respondents saw the crime as less of an issue in Scotland than overseas. In ,  per cent of people saw modern slavery as an issue in Scotland, falling to  per cent this year.People were far more likely to believe modern slavery to be an issue in Europe and the rest of the world - showing an awareness of the subject but a belief that it doesnrsquot happen here. Some  per cent of respondents admitted to a low level of understanding of human trafficking.At an event a few years ago I was chatting to a chap who said he owned a handful of car washes at dferent locations in the west of Scotland. He was quite confident in the ethics of his working practice, saying all his staff earned pound for a  hour day and were given a hot meal at lunchtime.The justication he gave to me was the men he employed would otherwise be out of work. With little English, no qualications and no support networks in Scotland, they would be destitute. He saw exploitation as, in fact, a gt to his staff, a generous springboard into a better le.That was the last time I visited the hand car wash.

Bluntly, more newly minted -year-old voters vote yes, and more dying voters vote no.So, the feeling of inevitability amongst the SNP hierarchy - and note that it is they who are pushing this rather than lsquoordinaryrsquo members - looks like it has a solid ballast.

There is another side to this story, and it remains to be seen whether the lurking risks for the yes campaign have been fully baked into their thinking.At the centre of this is the weekend poll showing unionist:nationalist sentiment at :. This was lauded as a breakthrough the first time a Panelbase poll has recorded such success. It is progress - of that there can be absolutely no doubt. But I am not at all convinced that it is enough. It was not so long ago that ostensibly senior people were briefing the media that they considered % pro-independence polling to be the point at which it was safe to agitate for another referendum. They talked of the stars aligningBrexit turned into a quagmireandBoris Johnson became Prime Minister . How many more stars do they need I see a requirement, from the nationalistsrsquo perspective, for the polling to be signicantly higher, because those lurking risks are real, and they provide a very competitive counterweight to the demographic idend.:SNP to scrap council fees for at home careDespite the polling indicating a perceived stronger economic future inside the EU than inside the UK, it remains a moot point whether economics will again be the Achilles Heel of the Yes campaign. It cannot be downplayed - the fiscal deficit is dismal, the currency question is further spiced by the inevitable debate over whether or not Scotland will have to join the Euro, and the Green-inspired drt to the left is creating an electorally worrying gap between personal tax rates north and south of the border, a gap which is only likely to expand.Other signicant drivers of voter behaviour will undoubtedly be more prevalent this time around. Voters in Scotland have had an election or referendum every year since  with the exception of last year, which despite the lack of a poll was anything but stable. By the time the next referendum comes around, we will have had another two national elections and, presumably, a formal exit from the EU.Lenin said there are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen. We are living that, now, and after the UK eventually leaves the EU it is a monumental request of the politically-fatigued Scottish people to plunge themselves into another potentially dficult constitutional negotiation.And then there is the EU relationship itself, in which so much stock is placed. For what itrsquos worth, I think that we are in a manufactured state. I say as a Remain voter that much of the Europhilia coursing through Scotland is faux, with no real foundation. It is a knee-jerk response to current turmoil. When we leave, votersrsquo default assumptions, and the starting point from which they decide which box to cross, will change.In essence, we will be asking Scottish voters to choose the EU over the UK. We will be asking them to leave a union to which they retain a fair emotional attachment, to join one to which their emotional attachment is unproven, at best. We may even be asking them to authorise the creation of some sort of, albeit probably limited, Scotland-England border checks.It is the ask of asks. So much so that I find it dficult to see the SNPrsquos official position being to immediately rejoin the EU.

It is farming but done with such a degree of technical sophistication that the pioneers would scarcely recognise it.But those early farmers would undoubtedly relish the extraordinarily good position that Scotland is now in,  years after they made those first tentative steps.They knew aquaculture was the future back then and it is even more the future now.:Demand for farmed salmon is causing an ecological disasterAlready more than half the fish eaten across the globe is farmed. By , that percentage has to rise to  per centwe are going to feed the world.And here we are in Scotland with a thriving, buoyant fish farming sector which is recognised as being at the very top of the world order.We have the coastline for farm-raised salmon, we have the water and we have the farming expertise. We have some of the toughest regulations anywhere and world-leading certication and auditing schemes.Everything is in place, you would think, for Scotland to take advantage of the growing demand for lean, healthy protein and for salmon to assume the central role in the economy that it does in somewhere like Norway.And yet, and yet hellip.There are still those who would do salmon farming down.Some of this is driven by prejudice, some by misinformation and some by myths which are based on  impressions of a farming sector from  or  years ago.Just take the issue of fish feed. Back in the s,  per cent of salmon feed was made of fish oil and fish meal.By  this had dropped to  per cent and it is predicted to drop to just  per cent in the next few years.Salmon farmers are using less and less fish in their feed as other, plant-based ingredients come on the market.And even the fish that is being used as an ingredient in the feed is coming from dferent, more sustainable sources.BACKGROUND:Fears revealed for food supply as Chinese fishmeal industry boomsThe main producers of feed for Scottish salmon now use trimmings from fish processing ndash unsuitable human consumption - to make up almost a third of fish content.Our farmers do not use feed which has ingredients from non-sustainable sources like India, Vietnam or The Gambia and they are proud of this record.Then therersquos the issue of medicines.Over the ten years to , medicine use dropped by nearly halfto its lowest level for a decade.Much of that is because farmers are using new and dferent treatments for sea lice ndash like cleanerfish, the wrasse and the lumpfish that eat the lice off the salmon in their pens.It has taken time but our farmers have now managed to close the breeding cycle and will soon be able to hatch, rear and grow their own cleanerfish, rather than take them from the wild.Salmon have the best conversion rate for feed to meat of any similar livestock. It takes about .kg of feed to produce kg of salmon, an extraordinary rate which is why the United Nations believes aquaculture really is the way to feed the world of tomorrow.Those camera feeds from the pens to the control barge help this process too. They ensure just the right amount of feed is delivered to the salmon at exactly the right time.Wasted feed which drops to the sea floor is no good to anyone which is why such strenuous efforts have been made cutting it back, efforts which mean that just g in every tonne, or just . per cent, is now wasted.And this raises a wider but crucial point: farmers want to protect the environment and this includes making sure there is as little waste as possible.It is the cold, clear, pristine waters of the Atlantic which produce such great Scottish salmon so farmers are working hard to make sure they stay that way.Scotlandrsquos farm-raised salmon have a good environmental story to tell. It is a story of top-quality feed, sourced from sustainable sources, of the lowest lice levels for six years, controlled largely by natural methods which have helped reduce medicine use to extraordinarily low levels.But it is also a story about Scotland not just playing its part in a global food revolution but leading it too.Solutions and technologies tried out here which will be used in aquaculture across the developing world in the future. Every step we take in making our sector more sustainable and efficient will be taken on a hundredfold where.This is the future: so we really can start feeding the world - from here, from Scotland.Hamish Macdonell is Director of Strategic Engagement for the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation."},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-cherry-im-not-complaining-not-nicolas-best-mate","story":"Joanna Cherry QC revealed she had only ever had one sit-down talk with the current First Minister despite being being an MP since .The Scottish Tories said it showed \"sour\" relations at the top of the party.Ms Cherry also said she had only received a single text of congratulations from Ms Sturgeon over her recent legal wins on Brexit and the unlawful prorogation of Westminster.ldquoIrsquom not complaining that Irsquom not Nicolarsquos best mate, she told Holyrood magazine, addingthe First Minister had a country to run.:Historic court defeat for Boris JohnsonHowever the Edinburgh South West MP said she was a good friend of Alex Salmond, calling him ldquothe greatest leader the partyrsquos ever had.Referring to former First Ministerrsquos impending criminal trial, she said she was worried about the ldquopolitical fall-out for the party.She said: ldquoAlex is my friend, and I was brought up to stand by my friends.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has admitted there are “known errors” in the RPI system and last year called for the UK Government to stop issuing bonds linked to it.But that advice has come too late for many local authorities in Scotland which are now shelling out millions more in costs for schools that were built under private finance initiatives.Costs of other Scottish PFI schemes, from prisons to hospitals, have also been rocketing since the deals were agreed.A Scottish Government spokesman said PFI had left “taxpayers in Scotland liable for a £ billion legacy of payments”.He added: “The annual PFI repayment bill now exceeds £ billion – nearly five times more than the Non-Profit Distributingprogramme which we introduced and is proving far better value to the public purse.“The funding of public infrastructure has vastly improved since . “We are working to ensure PFI contracts which have been inherited provide the best value for money for the taxpayer – and to ensure savings are achieved from existing contracts, wherever possible.”The Scottish Government is understood to be eyeing a model of public-private partnerships pioneered by the Welsh Government.Like PFI, the so-called Mutual Investment Model sees private partners build and maintain public assets for a fee.But the deals do not include services like cleaning, which have proved costly through PFI. The model also involves the public sector as a minority co-investor, taking a share of the profits.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.donsidepiper webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Figures published by Facebook show that #. million was spent on political ads on Facebook or sister site Instagram.\"  Thousands spent on targeted Facebook adverts by Scottish politicians viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"DONS | Article Teaser\"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has pledged to ban any further public-private finance dealshis party takes power.“Scotland’s historical PFI deals have put unnecessary pressure on our NHS, our local government services and right across the public sector,” he said.“That is why I have been clear that the Scottish Labour government that I lead will introduce a ban on new PFI PPP NPD deals.“We will also take private contracts back in-house at the earliest opportunity to save the taxpayer money in the long term.”The JPI Media investigations team has been looking into PFI contracts across the UK.According to figures obtained from hundreds of public bodies, rocketing inflation and extra costs are set to add at least £ billion to the overall price tag of PFI schemes.Among its findings, the team found that:• An NHS maternity unit built and run by a private company was closed after just  years but is still costing the taxpayer millions of pounds• A police force is trying to think up new uses for a mothballed custody suite it is still paying for• Expensive maintenance contracts have seen one police force billed £ for an extra chair.Trade union leaders have called for urgent action.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said the escalating costs of PFI were a “national scandal”.She said: “The money that has poured into the pockets of profit-hungry financial institutions and private companies could have been much better spent directly on public service projects and infrastructure. “PFIs are a rip-roaring example of out-of-control ‘bandit capitalism’.”"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : amCalMac Ferries are challenging Transport Scotland on its decision to award the Northern Isles ferry contract to competitor Serco Ltd.

It neither meets the needs of the local community nor the standards people in Orkney have a right to expect from their leline service.“I have raised these concerns with the First Minister and Transport Secretary in the past, highlighting the impact on constituents. I was given assurances that it would be addressed in the new contract.“Given the announcement that Serco Northlink has been chosen as the preferred bidder, it is important that the Scottish Government now claries what the arrangements will be for the forthcoming refit period.#The new contract needs to address the failings of the current contract and ensure that this leline route is served during the refit period by a vessel that is fit for purpose”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As is tradition, an ensign, which has been tied to the wreck of the battleship was presented to a family member of one of the crewmen. This year, it was presented to Allan Myers from Stoke-on-Trent, whose father, marine George Myers, was lost aboard the battleship.HMS Royal Oak sank to the bottom of Scapa Flow after it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-.

Most have since confirmed updates to their practices. Mr Osterloh acknowledged that wider regulation was needed for the technology sector and its use of data, but said Google was taking steps to make such processing more secure. ldquoIt would be great for regulation to be claried quickly, he said.ldquoThe approach wersquore taking is to try to keep all of this information on devices as much as possible and always keep it private and secure and encrypted.ldquoTherersquos certainly a key responsibility to make sure the userrsquos information is protected.ldquoBut everyone would benefit from clarity of standards and regulation.

The RNLI relies on donations to provide this training, to ensure that our leboat crew is as well prepared as they can be to help save lives at sea.”.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsay man gets new role at lerwick harbour ","story":"Capt Arthur was recruited to succeed Alexander Simpson who was recently promoted to harbourmaster.Deputy harbourmaster Captain Neil Arthur.Port authority chief executive Calum Grains said: #We are delighted to welcome Neil and the contribution he will make to our operations across the ious industry sectors.#Capt Arthur began his career as a cadet with Clyde Marine in , with sponsorship from the specialist geared cargo company Gearbulk.He later gained a BSc in Nautical Science from Strathclyde University and qualied as an officer from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies.Following employment by Gearbulk as a junior officer, he moved into the offshore industry with Subsea  for  years, rising through the ranks and gaining his chief officer#s licence from Glasgow College of Nautical Studies and master#s from Glasgow Maritime Academy..."},{"url":null,"title":"shetland among most vulnerable to brexit says msp todd ","story":"The SNP member has demanded that Brexit is halted and claims half of Shetlanders live in vulnerable communities.Maree ToddMs Todd is basing that on Scottish government analysis which led to the publication of #The Local Level Brexit Vulnerabilities in Scotland Report# this week. It states that rural and remote areas, especially those in The Highlands and Islands, have signicant populations at risk from the fallout of leaving the EU – with or without a trade deal.The report considers community access to services, working-age population, income deprivation, workers in #Brexit-sensitive# industries, EU worker migration and how many EU payments are received.Highlands and Islands representative Ms Todd said: “We always knew that Brexit would be damaging to Scotland but this new analysis really hits home the devastating impact that Brexit will have here in the Shetland Islands.“Families across Shetland will feel the impact of Brexit, with up to  per cent of the local population most vulnerable to the potential economic shock.“The SNP government will continue to do what it can to mitigate and minimise the impact on our most vulnerable communities, but this study lays bare the recklessness of the Tories in their blind determination to pursue Brexit at any cost.“Scotland never voted for Brexit and certainly not for the reckless extreme version now pursued by the UK government. It’s essential that we stop Brexit and go back to the people.”Ms Todd added that a report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies , also published this week, #found the UK is already £ billion worse off as a result of Brexit before we have even left the EU – with the UK economy .- per cent smaller than it otherwise would have been.#Over a million voters in Scotland voted for BREXIT, % of Shetlanders voted to leave, are their votes to be ignored  As a UNITED Kingdom we operate as a single unit well we did during two world wars. I find that Maree Todd’s concern about the potential economic effect that BREXIT could have upon Shetlanda bit of a cheek, coming from a party that currently has chalked up a deficit of £ billion for Scotland, due to irresponsible spending policies.Brexit, is nothing more than for the Tories to distance themselves from the EU, and to have a trade deal with the USA, and the, most likely, mass privatisation of most government responsibilities and duties of care going to US companies, where the Tories will benefit as shareholders of such companies. It is so typical of the Tories to put themselves first regardless to the devastating consequences of their policies and selfish agenda#s onto the people of the UK, especially those in society who struggle as it is. It will be a society of those who have and those who do not have. Where profit is the dominating principle which governs and controls those in power. Brexit, will make the UK, very much an unfair, unjust society for the majority of people. It will also have a great impact on smaller communities where the work-force is from the EU, and the economic circumstances putting many jobs and businesses at risk.Brexit, in all its forms, will cause more harm than good####not to mention poking the fires of xenophobia and racism in its wake.If Shetland is #among the most vulnerable to Brexit#, then presumably, it will also be #among the most vulnerable to Scexit# as we are guaranteed to be out of the EU with No Deal, should the SNP#s policy of Scottish independence ever become reality Tulloch undermines himself. As a UNITED Europe we acted as a single unit. Why should leaving one Union be better than leaving the other  He should reflect on the plain fact that it isn’t our European neighbours that are demanding we split from England against our stated will.“Take back control” my rear end.Peter Hamilton, we agree at last. You, at last, you admit to talking from your rear end!! Now it all makes sense.No Peter, it is the Tories. As I have previously mentioned, their agenda is nothing more than to privatise and hand control of the UK#s Health Care and and other Infrastructure to US companies, where the Tories will benefit mostly. The cost of living under Brexit, will most certainly increase, and the people most affected by it will struggle even more.The Tories, as they have always done, have only thought of themselvesand what they can gain regardless to the damaging consequences upon everybody  in society.Their policies and political motives are highly isive, and generally do more harm than good to society as a whole.Bad enough we have London Europe bleating how they will sufferwe leave EU, when frankly none of them venture beyond the M wall to see England.

Work was due to begin on the £.million project in August, but campaigners had occupied the green for over  days in a bid to block the development. Since , Friends of Glassmullin Open Greenhave campaigned against the facility, which is funded by Education NI for De La Salle College.In recent days, however, through consultation and engagement, the school and local community representatives have reached an agreement that will pave the way for the new G pitch. Amongst the terms of the agreement is a commitment that there will be no floodlights and a fence will not exceed . metres at the facility.The resolution will further ensure that there will be no infrastructure put in place for the installation of floodlights at a later date.A seven-person committee made up of school representatives, residents, and an independent chair will now be appointed to manage the facility.Local residents, Martin Derby and Anthony Marron, commented: “We have agreed, in good faith, a pathway to allow for the construction of the De La Salle Sports Facility to commence. Recently we have been part of positive and open discussions with the college and the outcome is a cohesive proposal that benefits all parties involved. This proposal has now been accepted and we will work closely together through a newly formed committee for the project delivery. We will continue to act with the community and our young people at heart throughout the forthcoming process.”Claire White, Principal De La Salle College, said: #The school is delighted to have worked in partnership with local residents to reach a mutual agreement thus allowing for the construction of the sports facility to begin. The facility will provide much needed sports amenities for the pupils of De La Salle College as well as for young people within the community. We are excited to see the project come to fruition and are looking forward to participating and working with the newly formed committee to ensure community cohesion.#Construction of the facility is due to start imminently partnered with ongoing engagement across residents and interest groups via the newly formed joint committee."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"decision due on casement in month","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has said that a decision on the planning application for the redevelopment of Casement Park could be reached in the next month.The £ million redevelopment plans had previously faced setbacks due to safety concerns linked to the size of the stadium.Planning permission was granted for a , capacity stadium in , but in  approval was quashed in a High Court legal challenge brought by Mooreland # Owenragh Residents’ Association .New plans to build a , capacity Casement Park were submitted by Ulster GAA in February .Mr Maskey, who recently met with planners at the Department for Infrastructure , said that, while some information regarding the decision was still outstanding, a decision on the application is imminent.“The department are still waiting on some information coming back to them from DFI roads,” he said.“Obviously when they get that back they’ll have to go through that with due diligence.“When they get that information, which should be within the next month, then hopefully they will be able to make a decision. I hope that they will make that decision as soon as possible.“There have been other large-scale applications that have been submitted after Casement Park, which have already been decided. So once they get that information from DfI Road they should make that decision without delay.”Meanwhile MORA has written to the DfI Planning to object to the new stadium proposals.The letter, which has been seen by the Andersonstown News, states that “Further Environemtal Information” provided by Ulster GAA in July “fails to allay” concerns about development of the stadium “to an oversized capacity”.The residents’ association insists that the redevelopment would have “unacceptable impacts” on people in the area including “excessive over-shadowing and loss of daylight”, air pollution, as well as “noise, disturbance and safety issues” should proposals for three major concerts a year at the stadium be given the green light.“In addition, the applicant has been unable to demonstrate that the road network can safely handle the extra vehicular traffic that would be generated by sporting and concert events,” the letter reads.“The applicant’s proposals for safe evacuation, which now extend to the Stockmans Lane roundabout, also give rise to serious concern and demand for more rigorous scrutiny.”A spokesperson for Ulster GAA said: “Within its planning application, including its Further Environmental Information submission, Ulster GAA has comprehensively addressed all factors relating to the stadium’s operations and impact, with the Safety Technical Group having unanimously supported the project plans.“As the stadium plans are currently under consideration by the Department for Infrastructure it would be inappropriate to comment further on the live planning application.”The Safety Technical Group comprises representatives from Sport NI Belfast City Council, the PSNI, the NI Ambulance Service the NI Fire and Rescue Service Sports Grounds Safety Authority and the GAA’s ground safety management."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/shirleyvalentine-digitalad-anderstown.png","title":"playboy as relevant today as it ever was","story":"One of the most iconic plays of Irish theatre has been reimagined for our times and received a standing ovation at the Lyric Theatre during its opening night.Running until November , JM Synge’s The Playboy of the Western World tells the story of Pegeen Mikewho is tired of her le, working in her father’s pub in a small village in rural Ireland, where she isbetrothed to the dull Shawn Keogh, only for stranger Christy Mahonto walk into her le with a story that sets the whole village talking.While all the women in the village have their heads turned by Christy, whose dark secret makes him all the more attractive, the playboy’s past threatens to catch up with him and it surely does.First performed in , the play is as fresh today as it was when it caused riots in Dublin on its opening night.

But Aidan was intrigued by the natural world – just like so many youngsters today – and when he was  his le changed forever when a simple thing happened – his father bought him a pair of binoculars so he could better study the birds he spent so much time watching in the gardens of Riverdale.Those old second-hand binoculars were the catalyst that propelled him on a le journey that culminated this week in the opening of an Eco Wildle Garden at St Michael’s Nursery School in Andersonstown.The garden was a labour of love for Aidan and fellow wildle crusader Debbie ‘Doolittle’ Nelson. Their plan to build a nature haven for kids – rather than a common play park – got the full backing of the school. Principal Clare McAllister said the children now choose themselves to go outdoors every day.“They just love to be outside in the middle of nature – so many children don’t get the opportunity to getoutside. And I think this park will encourage children and parents to use our parks and public amenities more,” she said. Board of Governors chairperson Sean Óg McGuinness said that even bad weather doesn’t deter the kids. “They just put on their wet gear and can’t wait to get out to play. It’s a nature paradise.”Aidan and Debbie spent months designing and perfecting the garden – Debbie herself did all the joinery work, making the  bird boxes, as well as hedgehog havens in each corner and a wildle pond.“I planted giant water lilies for dragonflies to rest on, and just as I was putting them in during the summer a dragonfly flew by,” said Debbie. “So even though we’re in the heart of West Belfast there are still some rarities about here.”Debbie even managed to allow pathways for hedgehogs to the fenced-off pond by cutting mini-archways into the fence. “The pond itself has wee ramps so frogs and newts and hedgehogs can safely visit it,” she said.And the nestboxes aren’t just to attract garden birds – one at the front of the school has been designed for kestrels. Aidan said: “You can just imagine the faces of the kidsa pair of kestrels take up residence here. It would be fantastic.”In fact the boxes are designed to provide homes for seven other species – including swts, robins, house sparrows, treecreepers and bats. The children’s eco garden – behind the school beside St Michael’s church – is sheltered by giant trees including oaks that long predate the school – “it could be one of the oldest oak trees in West Belfast,” said Aidan.He added: “We need to be teaching young ones, today, at home, in school and crucially in the nursery – the formative years – how to appreciate and look after wildle, the pollinators, birds, bats, hedgehogs, vegetables, amphibians, orchards and ultimately ourselves so to be best placed in years to come to deal with all the many complex survival challenges ahead for people and bioersity.” Things were so dferent when Aidan was young. The binoculars which helped instil a love of nature unfortunately didn’t last long. British soldiers based in nearby Casement noticed them being used at an upstairs window and thought they were being spied on. They raided his house, running up the stairs to find Aidan birdwatching from his bedroom.The soldiers confiscated the binoculars. “The gave me a wee ticket, and said I could collect them when the Troubles were over,” Aidan said this week. “I never imagined that would be  years later!” Aidan never got his hands on those binoculars again, but he attributes that short time spent with that special gt from his father to his lelong love of nature. Five years later, his father was killed by a British army Saracen in a crash on the Falls Road.“Those binoculars launched me on the journey that I’m still enjoying.

Thats going to be the starting point going forward.\"It is a ridiculous position to have been placed into, and it shows the total ineptitude of the DUPs so-called negotiating position over the last three years.\"Mr Allister told yesterdays Radio Ulster Nolan Show that the DUP had been \"foolish\" by shting its position on a regulatory border in the Irish Sea, which had resulted it in being \"shafted\" by the Government.He told the Belfastthe removal of the \"unionist veto\" would have serious implications for Northern Irelands constitutional future in the UK.\"It is becoming clearer that the DUP were sucked into agreeing a regulatory border in the Irish Sea with the promise of a unionist veto - and once they were sucked in, they are to be shafted,\" Mr Allister said. \"If the unionist veto is to go,there is to be a customs border as well as a regulatory border, and we are to be put in captivity in the EU and removed essentially from the UK economy and put in the orbit of the economy of the Republic - then it is very serious for the future of the Union,\" he continued.Mr Allister called on the DUP to \"disavow\" the regulatory border in the Irish sea, and take a \"step back\".But Sir Jeffrey branded the remarks as unhelpful at a time when unity between unionists is called for.\"This is a time when unionist parties with common ground on Brexit should be working together rather than attacking each other,\" he told the Belfast . \"The DUP has led from the front on Brexit whilst others have remained on the sidelines.\"It is deeply disappointing that some fellow unionists are peddling nonsense against the DUP based on media speculation. \"We want to see a sensible and balanced negotiated agreement as we leave the EU, but arrangements that create barriers to trade in the Irish Sea would not be supported by us,\" Sir Jeffrey added."},{"url":null,"title":"dup held series of meetings with loyalists to discuss eu exit specifics","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The warning led to calls for greater engagement with the loyalist community.In a series of tweets yesterday, journalist Brian Rowan alleged that Mrs Foster, along with other senior DUP colleagues, met with Jimmy Birch, Jackie McDonald and Matt Kincaid, who have previously been named as senior UDA figures.At a separate meeting, organised through the auspices of the Action for Community Transformation project, Mr Rowan stated that alleged senior UVF members Winston Irvine and Harry Stockman were present.Read MoreDUP defends its position as rivals claim it’s been ‘suckered’ in Brexit talksThe former BBC NI security editor said it was his view that it was important that loyalists are \"involved included in legacy and other dialogues, including Brexit\". A loyalist source told the journalist: \"Whatever is going to happen, they [the DUP] need to answer the questions before they are asked. Is it a good deal  Is it a bad deal  Is it the only deal \"The source continued: \"If Sinn Fein thinks its all right [any Brexit deal] loyalists will think its all wrong.\"Mr Rowan also tweeted that he was told that loyalists are exploring ways for their concerns to be heard outside Northern Ireland and that a \"mechanism means\" to achieve this is currently being explored. According to the Sunday Times, sources within the UVF have said it is planning to organise demonstrations and protests using proxy groupsthe government attempts a Brexit compromise by aligning Northern Ireland and the Republic in any customs arrangement.A DUP spokesperson said: \"The Party engages with a range of stakeholders about a range of matters on an ongoing basis in the interests of moving Northern Ireland forward.\"Meanwhile, the UDA in west Belfast were said to be adopting a \"wait and see\" approach until the specics of any Brexit deal are announced.In response, the Ulster Unionist MLA Doug Beattie had said he believes that the loyalist community has not been engaged with enough on Brexit issues.Commenting on the alleged meetings between the loyalist representatives and the DUP, loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson said there was \"nothing controversial\" about the largest unionist party engaging with a \"signicant section\" of the unionist and loyalist community.\"I dont think theres anything overly signicant about that however, I do think the DUP should be listening to the voices of the grassroots in the unionist and loyalist community,\" he added. \"I do think in the past number of days we have certainly seen a change from the DUPs position last week where they were ultimately almost signing up for an economic united Ireland. I wasnt present at any of these meetings.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

We first have to come to an agreement on negotiator level and secondly would have to be approved at European Council and third go to the House of Commons.”Mr Varadkar said that while he and Mr Johnson had a “broad meeting of minds” on the key Brexit stumbling blocks, turning that into legal text is “a dferent thing”.“Our objectives have always been the same, it’s to avoid a hard border North and South and allow the all-island economy to thrive and to allow North South co-operation to resume as envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement and ensure the integrity of the single market and our place in it,” he added.“These discussions are happening in Brussels. I will get a further briefing this evening so the situation may have changed in the last few hours but the gap was still quite wide, particularly on the issue of customs,” he added.His comments come as Ireland’s deputy premier said he remains hopeful a Brexit deal can be fleshed out before the crucial EU summit.Simon Coveney rejected claims that a deal cannot be negotiated in time for the EU Summit in Brussels on Thursday and FridaySpeaking after his briefing with the European Union’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Luxembourg, Mr Coveney warned that a lot of progress needs to be made over the next  hours between the EU and UK negotiating teams, who are locked in discussions.This isnt a time for optimism or pessimism quite frankly, we need to deal with the facts as we see themSimon Coveney“I don’t think it’s inevitable that they can’t get a deal before the summit,” Mr Coveney said.“I think what Michel Barnier said today was very clear, that it’s dficult but possible to have a deal between the two negotiating teams this side of the leaders’ summit.“That means that a lot of progress needs to be made today, but I think that’s doablethere is a willingness on both sides to move this process to conclusion.“Of course,that doesn’t happen, well then it leads to another debate in terms of how the leaders will respond to that in the context of whether more time will be needed or whether we can continue discussions into next week on trying to get the job done.”Ireland’s foreign affairs minister told reporters that securing a deal will require “a big step forward” from the negotiating teams today.“This isn’t a time for optimism or pessimism quite frankly, we need to deal with the facts as we see them,” he added.Good meetings in Lux. today at GAC. ⁦@MichelBarnier⁩ provided a detailed update on state of #Brexit negotiations.

Foryou know who should hear ya, you know what youd get..pushThose lyrics kept repeating in my head after the summit between An Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar and British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson. Nobody was saying much about anything.And the chorus wasnt much better. Take the words of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Julian Smith, on the meeting: \" I am not going into the details of the negotiations.\" Then Micheal Martin. Leader of Fianna Fail: \" The less said in public, the better!\" And the Taoiseach, in rare harmony, said: \"I wont be going into detail as its sensitive.

The key is whether both parties feel the same way the morning after the night before.The format of the day was unusual. Meetings occurred between the British and Irish teams, then reduced down to handful of key advisors and both Prime Ministers. This was followed by a brisk walk and some couple time for the two leaders.Much can be lost in translation from such a format. Understandings and undertakings may become blurred. Could it all be a charm offensive to prepare for the blame game  Maybe, but I think not. Johnson needs a deal. As does Leo. And so does Northern Ireland.The morning after and the goodwill seems to have prevailed all the way to Brussels for the meeting between Brexit Secretary, Steve Barclay, and EU Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.The semi news block out is necessary. All too often, careless talk, sniping briefings and megaphone diplomacy has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory.This is not the time to allow the futures of two neighbouring countries, who have joint stewardship of the problem child - Northern Ireland - to have their negotiations dissected and pulled apart by Twitter trolls, jumped up bovver boys, madcap lefties and right wing loonies.There will be nervousness within the DUP ranks. Further pragmatism may be required.They should face up to this because such pragmatism will not change the constitutional position of NI within the UK.It will demonstrate maturity and it delivers on the joint Executive Letter of August , signed by Arlene Foster and the late Martin McGuinness and their stated desire for a soft landing for NI post Brexit.Being mature, leading from the front and not bowing to the lowest common denominator in loyalism would do much to restore the cross-community credibility the DUP lost during the past , days.Johnsons electoral success depends on delivering a Brexit which is recognised as such by voters in Britain. If there is a ranking order for his priorities, it is wherever his votes are. They are not in Northern Ireland, as the Tories hardly register on the Richter scale.The alignment of some in the DUP to the Brexit Party is like hitching a lt on a Catherine wheel, momentarily exciting, all sparks, only to fizzle out like a damp squib.Farage never looks like a man who wants a full-time political job. Post Brexit, his party will disintegrate, as did its predecessor, UKIP.Sinn Feins leadership has been unusually quiet. Mary Lou gave a cautious welcome to the news there was positive vibes coming from the Anglo-Irish summit.When a Brexit deal didnt look at all possible, some in Sinn Fein hoped a crash out of the EU would lead to the type of chaos which would anger nationalist voters.

That said, every election in Northern Ireland is a quasi border poll.The Tories will never concede on a border poll whilst in hoc to the DUP. The momentum has, for the time being, left any prospect for a border poll years away. Unionists should take comfort in that, too.Deal or no deal - Sinn Fein probably thought they could still make electoral advantage from either outcome.If, and its a huge , a no-deal Brexit is avoided, Sinn Fein will come under huge pressure to go back into the Assembly and restore the Executive.

EU member state would “act as a bridge between Brussels and London, helping rebuild the shattered relationship”, an SNP MP has said..pushThe SNP’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman Stephen Gethins said the UK union had “no automatic right to existence” as he branded Brexit an “almighty mess”.He said Britain’s place in the world “has rarely been more diminished than it has been by this Government today”.The MP North East Fe blasted the “continuing failure of those who sold a Brexit myth and have absolutely no idea how to deliver it”.Speaking during the Queen’s Speech debate in the Commons, Mr Gethins said: “The UK union has no automatic right to existence and it is increasingly clear that the best thing for everyone in the UK is that we build a real partnership of equals and that of course is only achievable with independence as Brexit has underlined.“Brexit helps nobody and it’s been particularly harmful for our relationships with our closest neighbours.“But for some time and today the First Minister’s doing the same thing in Aberdeen, we can argue that Scotland can help.“As a member state in our own right, Scotland will act as a bridge between Brussels and London, helping rebuild the shattered relationship.”Mr Gethins warned the “broader mess of Brexit is seen more globally where the UK has become more and more isolated at a time it needs to work with its international partners”.Independence is normal, member status of the EU is normal, Brexit isolationism is not normal.Stephen GethinsHe said: “This is a Government that models itself and its policy onTrump’s White House.“That’s not the international positioning the UK Government should be looking at, that is not the leadership that anybody should be looking at.”He added: “Independence is normal, member status of the EU is normal, Brexit isolationism is not normal.“So leaving the EU will make us poorer, more decentralised, less fair and isolated from our closest partners.”Proposals in the Queen’s Speech to end freedom of movement were “damaging and regressive”, he added.Mr Gethins said: “It’s traditional in democracy to set out your plans before the vote rather than four years later scrabbling about days before you’re due to leave seeking a plan.”Independent Steve Brineasked whether the SNP would want to keep the pound.Intervening, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: “Let me give an absolute cast iron commitment that when the SNP brings forward its plans for independence as we will very shortly, we will set out in exact detail the kind of country that we want.“And have an open discussion with friends and opponents as to what kind of society that we want to live in."},{"url":null,"title":"very funny duchess of cornwall meets booker prize winners","story":" Hi degC |

The popular presenter has a close affinity to the Down side, having been brought up in Burren, and will bring plenty of fun and laughter to the proceedings.Louise Kearney, part of the organising committee, said excitement is building in the area on the countdown to the historic night in the club on Saturday, October .She added: ldquoWe are delighted the Down legends are coming to spend a special evening in our clubrooms. It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with All-Ireland winners. We are very proud to have two Loughinisland men who gave so much to the county, and continue to give so much to our club and community.Itrsquos a night not to be missed as this is a landmark year for the Down side who created history when they brought Sam Maguire across the border for the fth time.Louise said: ldquoIt may be one of the last times the squad will be together in a club in this capacity for a number of years and we are grateful they are spending that time with us. We will have a relaxed but enthralling evening as we look back at the glory days.While the spotlight will be on the Down legends, families from the Loughinisland Justice Group will be special guests at the event and their loved ones will be remembered during the night.Louise added: ldquoWe will also take time to remember that  was such a dficult year for Loughinisland. A quarter of a century on from the massacre, we will think back on the impact of the Down win on the community, the uplt that the team brought and the footballing spirit which helped people through the darkest days. We have a lot of stories to hear.The organisers have secured the Sam Maguire and Anglo-Celt cups for the event so there will be opportunities on the night to get photographs taken alongside the Down greats and the legendary silverware.Former Down and Loughinisland player Alan Molloy, who is also one of the organisers, said it was a remarkable feat that a small rural club like Loughinisland had three medals from the great teams of the s and their achievements had brought much joy and prestige to the club.He added: ldquoThis will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce with these All-Ireland winners, including Loughinisland men Gary Mason and Gerard Colgan, who gave so much to the county and continue to give so much to our club and community.ldquoGary Mason is the proud owner of two medals, from the victories in  and . Whilst Gerard Colgan was playing for An Riocht in , he spent the last of his playing days with Loughinisland. Both players are now passing on their valuable knowledge to the future generations through coaching our underage teams.ldquoThe club is very grateful that so many legends of the  team are ing to spend this evening with us.

A great start to her league campaign and pressure on dad to produce in his race.James Armstrong has had a great summer of cycling and has taken this rich vein of form into the cyclo-cross. Curtis McKee, from Maryland Wheelers, would keep James from the top spot of the podium, but only by a mere six seconds.With junior members having set the scene at the cyclocross it was time for the senior team to get on their bikes.In the MTB Support race Mick Foley, fresh back from injury and claiming to be unfit, tore through the mud to claim a top  finish leaving expectations that he can only get better and better.The club had a large representation in the B race which saw  riders competing.It didnrsquot last long for Gibson Chambers as he got caught up in a crash at the start.This left Paul Hamilton taking the honour of first Dromara man home in sixth place, not far behind was Richard Cowan in eighth, Brian Kellett managed to take th and hold off Darren McCann, just.Adi Booth took the bragging rights as he finished ahead of Bryce Hetherington and Mike Barton finishing st, rd and th respectively.

We believe he is still finding out the additional things he can do with his new hand and therersquos still improvements ahead.Mr Moore said Alfie learnt to write with his left hand and still does but there is hope that over time, that he might be able to write and use his prosthesis hand for everything he normally does with his left hand.He says that Alfiersquos classmates and other pupils have accepted the new addition to the P pupil very well.Mr Moore added: ldquoWersquore never have had any problems with other children understanding about Alfie. I think adults could learn from children as they might ask a question about the arm but once itrsquos answered, they move on as they are very accepting..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Brief.jpg","title":"Brief to redevelop Irish Street closer  ","story":"A DEVELOPMENT brief designed to transform the former Irish Street police station site in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent empty buildings could be ready within weeks, the Down Recorder understands.Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Department for Communities are helping spearhead a an exciting retail and commercial proposal aimed at transforming the townrsquos economy.Final agreement has been reached with all key stakeholders to draw up a dedicated team to come up with a development brief which will outline what the local authority would like to see developed at a huge area of land.The brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area, while there are also plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise its potential and make the most of its historical heritage.When completed, the development brief will be advertised, inviting third parties to come forward with viable proposals for the site that will result in sustainable regeneration in Downpatrick town centre.It has also been confirmed that permission has been secured to purchase an outstanding piece of ground close to the irish Street car park to allow the ambitious proposal to proceed.Itrsquos almost two years since it was revealed that the former police station site had been earmarked for a major economic regeneration initiative which could potentially include new housing.A number of the vacant buildings will be bulldozed to open up a huge area at the rear of the former police station, with the proposed development site also including the local authority-owned car park.But the former police station mdash which enjoys protected status ndash will not be razed to the ground as part of the ambitious multi-million pound regeneration plan. It is set to remain a key feature of the proposed redevelopment project.Council officials insist that the former police basersquos listed building status is not an impediment to the development of the site and while they concede that preserving the building will be a challenge, it is also presents an opportunity to something exciting with it.The heritage value of the site, which extends as far back as St Patrickrsquos Avenue, is something council officials are not only keen to preserve, but build upon as they work with the Department for Communities to maximise the potential of the site.The government department, which has already acquired the former PSNI base, is working in partnership with the local authority to help bring new investment to Downpatrick town centre.Leading brands such as Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains, along with several other big names, are keen to invest in Downpatrick, but at present cannot identy suitable accommodation to meet their respective needs.Those behind the Irish Street plan hope that a redevelopment scheme can act as a catalyst for additional town centre investment, increasing footfall and providing a boost for existing businesses which have been at the backbone of the townrsquos economy for many years.Councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed confirmation that work on the development brief could be completed shortly.He believes that the transformation of the former police base and adjacent land can provide Downpatrick with a signicant economic boost, creating new retail space and much-needed jobs.Cllr Curran reiterated the importance of the townrsquos business community being asked for its input into the redevelopment plan which has the potential to attract more shoppers to the town.He said many will be looking forward to seeing the detail of the development brief and the potential options for a hugely important development site in the heart of Downpatrick.ldquoThere has been no signicant retail investment in the town for quite some time.

Bright finally got their hands on the JFC trophy after a pulsating victory over Aughlisnafin at Pairc Esler on Sunday.Despite having lost the previous six finals they have appeared in, the Ballynoe-based club went into the clash full of confidence and it showed as they broke Aughlisnafinrsquos hearts with an expansive display.The game ebbed and flowed throughout with fortune favouring the brave.Aughlisnafin seized the early initiative before the departure of Mark Stratton to a straight red card threatened to derail their challenge.However, Bright were unable to take real advantage and just when they made their move, Seamas Tumelty joined Stratton for an early shower.The game opened up at this stage with Bright showing a greater composure to prevent Aughlisnafin from completing the double in a thrilling finale to the game.Oran Flanagan and Cailean Toner exchanged early scores in a positive opening to the game before a long range point from the impressive Adam Garland and a good effort from Shane McCann sent the lsquoFin into a - to - lead by the sixth minute.The action was hot and heavy all over the park, but Stratton saw red in the th minute and Bright took full advantage.Sam Dinu reduced the deficit to a single point before the accurate Flanagan converted a free to restore the lsquoFinrsquos two-point lead.Dinu and Breannain McComiskey swapped scores before two Flanagan frees stretched Aughlisnafinrsquos lead to four points, despite being down to  men.Kyran Smythrsquos side held on grimly to the lsquoFinrsquos coat tails and just before the break Gareth George helped breathe new le into Brightrsquos challenge when he pointed from a rsquo to leave his side trailing - to - at half-time.The second half was in its infancy when Bright lay down their marker.A blistering spell of attacking football yielded unanswered points from Declan Trainor, Kevin Groves and the ubiquitous George to draw level.There was only one team in it at this stage, but Bright went and shot themselves in the foot when Tumelty fell foul of the referee and was shown the red card.Brightrsquos heads were now down and Flanagan punished the indiscretion when he pointed the lsquoFin into a - to - lead after  minutes.Smyth sent for the cavalry at this stage and it duly arrived in the shape of Matt McKiernan.The rangy forward was on hand to steer the ball past Calum Croskery and when Toner quickly tagged on a point, Bright suddenly and from nowhere, were three points clear, - to -.Driven on remorselessly by Donagh Steele, Aughlisnafin battled back and points from Sean Fitzsimmons and two from Flanagan had it all square again with  minutes gone.The game was still being played at a hectic pace and with  minutes gone, Garland pointed the lsquoFin into a deserved, but precarious - to - lead.Dinu held his nerve to level matters, but Aughlisnafin went back in front thanks to a point from Shea Croskery. Corey Ranaghan quickly levelled matters, but that man Croskery gave his side a - to - lead with less than eight minutes remaining.Fingernails were being bitten to the quick as Bright went in search of the equaliser and it arrived less than a minute later via a Kevin Groves free.It was now a case of who dares wins as the game hurtled to a conclusion and points from George, Dinu and Matthew Burns had Bright literally home and hosed.Aughlisnafin refused to capitulate and they knew that only a goal would do, but all they could muster in added time was a point from Flanagan as Bright held on for an historic win.Bright: Michael Farrand, Barry Mageean, Marc Burke, Seamas Tumelty, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Nicholas OrsquoConnor, Jack McLaughlin, Corey Ranaghan , Cailean Toner , Sam Dinu , Kevin Groves , Declan Trainor , Owen McEvoy, Gareth George , Rian Tempany.

The exercise is expected to take around  months to complete.Council officials will examine each community centre in detail with the exercise looking at the population they serve, the number of young people in their area, crime statistics andthe facilities are located in so-called neighbourhood renewal areas.One area the review will examine will be Crossgar where local people are keen to see new community centre provided.A major feasibility study was carried out a number of years ago with a site adjacent to St Colmcillersquos High School in the village identied as the preferred location for a new community and sports centre. While a new facility was never constructed, the forthcoming review will examinethe need for it remains.The idea of the community centre probe is to determine potential under provision and where new facilities may be required moving forward.Council officials will also look to seethere is over provision in any areas but insist there are no plans to close any existing centres. They argue that the main driver is about increasing and improving community provision across the district.While itrsquos still early days, council officials say they will work through the process over the next year and will keep ratepayers fully informed about consultation meetings which will be held across all seven district electoral areas to ensure everyone has an opportunity to have their say.Described as a ldquosignicant piece of work, the review will also include discussions with community groups and associations.Insisting that the review is not about closing community centres, council officials say the examination of current provision will focus on where they are located and local need. And they have suggested that the exercise could potentially throw up issues which surfaced during the playground strategy which resulted in some play parks amalgamating.Council officials say while the intention is not to close any centres at this stage, the review will focus on potential gaps in current provision to help form strategic decisions about where to build new centresthis is required.The review will also examine which community centres may require refurbishment and potential extensions to allow them to meet increasing demand.Council officials have confirmed that a number of the districtrsquos community centres are part-funded by the Department for Communities with a number also run by local groups and associations.Ahead of the community centre review, council officials have been conducting an exercise looking at the user figures and the number of programmes that the respective centres deliver. Part of the forthcoming review will also take a critical look at funding streams to help increase centre usage.Council officials say the parks and open spaces strategy will identy those that need upgraded and those which are not necessarily adding any value. It will examine those that can be improved with the review rolled out over the next  months.When the community centre and parks and open spaces review has been completed, initial reports will be debated by the local authorityrsquos Active and Health Communities Committee which will then make recommendations to the full councilto agree a new strategy moving forward..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C October 9%2C 1979  ","story":"STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash Police have still not recovered the body of the second man drowned on a fishing trip to Strangford Lough at the weekend.At Downpatrick police station mdash from where the search operation was co-ordinated mdash police say there is no hope that  year-old Carrickfergus man, Mr John Craig, is still alive.They believe that Mr Craigrsquos body has been swept out into the Irish Sea and search has now been stretched to the Isle of Man.Mr Craig went in a -foot fibre glass cabin cruiser to fish for mackerel bait on Saturday afternoon, along with with Peter Johnson , from Woodcroft Rise, Braniel, Belfast.In the early hours of Sunday morning police were alerted by the relatives of the two men, anxious that neither had ed.

No one player has a bigger or more important job than anyone .They are in this together and they have an unfaltering belief in their own ability and work on the motto thatyou fail to prepare, prepare to fail.Martin McCourt has dislodged the experienced Niall Kane in goal for the last few games and could well hold on to the number one spot for the final.One thing for certain, bar injury, is that the five Branagan brothers will start, four in defence, with Eugene lining out at corner forward, but given a licence to roam.They epitomise everything good about Kilcoo.

They must attack Kilcoo and utilise their magical set of forwards.McAleenans men have shipped a lot of scores in the league and to invite Kilcoo on to them would not be advisable.Thats why going at Kilcoo from the off and getting top scorer Ross McGarry involved early on is essential.McGarry is the one player who has the ability and temperament to unsettle Kilcoo.He is not the biggest full forward in the game, but he has pace, bravery and rarely misses in front of goal.He is undoubtedly Warrenpoints ace in the pack and along with the Boyle brothers adds a touch of class to the Points challenge.McGarry relies heavily on Donagh McAleenan, Ruairi McCormick, Aaron Magee, Ryan Mallon and Ryan Boyle and this unit must be firing on all cylindersWarrenpoint are to cause a shock win.Kilcoo are red hot favourites at   with a generous   being offered on Warrenpoint.

The key issue we have to address is the presence of a wet weather centre in the resort which I would suggest includes a fun-type family pool, he said.ldquoI believe that alongside this there needs to be a few swimming lanes to accommodate the needs of local people who have not had access to modern leisure facilities for some considerable time.Cllr Clarke said this issue needed to be flagged up as part of the consultation process on the way forward.He said it was important that elected representatives highlighted the needs of local people during the process.ldquoWe are talking about a once in a generation opportunity to deliver a modern leisure facility in Newcastle and we will not be settling for less. The location is good and while there may be issues with parking, these are not insurmountable.ldquoWe are talking about a complete new build which will maximise the large area of space at the rear of the existing centre and I would be keen to see a high quality design, comprising wood and glass, he said.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an eco-friendly building, which is both sustainable and carbon neutral..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th October 2019 Planners.jpg","title":"Planners recommend expansion at Newcastle’s Barbican supermarket  ","story":"A LEADING Newcastle business is in line for a major extension.Planners are recommending that mdash subject to a number of conditions mdash an amended proposal to expand the Barbican filling station at the Dundrum Road in the resort should be given the green light.The approval recommendation is due to be discussed at a meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Planning Committee on Wednesday of next week.The proposal includes the redevelopment of the existing petrol station and forecourt and extending the storersquos retail space.

A pilot project is being launched this month which will run until the end of March.Groups that have expressed an interest in taking part in the pilot include the Inverbrena Community Association in Strangford, Newcastle Community Cinema, the Downpatrick-based charity Le Change, Changes Lives, Castlewellan Regeneration, St Vincent de Paul and MYMY in Newcastle, Habitat for Humanity.The local authority has agreed a formal reuse system with the pilot scheme monitored monthly to test how successful it is.Moving forward, council officials plan to work with representatives from local groups and charities to understand their particular needs and the items they are keen to secure for their respective organisations.It has also been confirmed that a rota will be established to ensure that collection dates can be arranged for the groups and charities which sign up to the scheme.Council officials plan to liaise with the ious groups to agree collection days and advertise the scheme, with contact be made with the Environment Agency to regulate the reuse initiative.Groups keen to recycle items which have been left at the local centres will also be required to submit a business case detailing how they will be collected, refurbished and reused, in addition to maintaining a record of all material removed.Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke ,has welcomed the scheme to allow local groups to reuse items left at the districtrsquos household recycling centres.ldquoI very much welcome this scheme which will operate as a pilot and be reviewed monthly, he said.While these groups cannot remove electrical items from local centres I believe the decision which prevents them from being used by local groups should be reviewed.

than at first thought.Roads officials have this week confirmed the road will remain closed until October  as part of a pound, improvement scheme at Collinsrsquo Corner where five roads converge.Work on the scheme mdash which started last month and is due to complete in November mdash includes a new footpath at the Killough Road and a new left turn lane from Pound Lane into the Killough Road.Other aspects of the scheme include upgrading existing traffic signal equipment and the introduction of a one-way traffic systemon Lower Stream Street from the junction towards Racecourse Hill.Roads officials say the scheme should improve traffic progression and that due to the nature of the work involved, it will be necessary to operate a number of off-peak road and lane closures.Signed ersions will be provided with the Department of Infrastructure asking motorists to comply with all temporary traffic restrictions and to drive with care when travelling through, or in the vicinity of the works to help ensure the safety of road users and workers.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran said he was pleased with the progress on the scheme and believes that extending the closure at Pound Lane should result in major problems for drivers.ldquoWork on the upgrade appears to be progressing well and it is my understanding that there have been no major disruptions, he said.Cllr Curran also

","story":"BALLYNAHINCH shook off their insipid displays in the SONI Premiership to push much-fancied Terenure right to the wire in their first appearance back in AIL Division A since .The Dublin outfit were the form team over the second half of last season and having recently clinched the Leinster Senior League title, were heavy favourites with pundits and bookmakers prior to kick off.They were also almost at full strength, while the home side were patched up in midfield after losing Rory Butler to injury. Veteran centre Stuart Morrow was again pressed into service with Aaron Cairns ing on the wing following concussion.Up front Ben Cullen earned the starting loose head spot and hugely influential number  Conall Boomer ed from injury. However, with eight players involved in the Ulster A Celtic Cup game on Friday night and four more in South Africa with the Pro squad, Brian McLaughlinrsquos options were limited.Tom Stewart and Connor Rankin were released to take their places on the bench, but the team that took the field was largely drawn from the squad which had been under-performing over the pre-AIL period.A few honest words on Tuesday night and an exceptional week on the training paddock clearly made a big dference as the home side tore into their opponents from the whistle.Playing away from the clubhouse and into the wet and gusty conditions, they drove into the Terenure half and were rewarded for an excellent scrum with a penalty to allow Sean OrsquoHagan to give his side the lead.Some indiscipline from a visibly fired up home forward pack allowed Terenure the chance to gain a foothold in the home half, but a superb turnover from Boomer on former lsquoHinch prop Campbell Classon allowed Ryan Wilson to clear.Cairns was doing his best to keep the home support involved and after skinning his opposite number twice in quick succession, he proceeded to drive him almost into the home dugout with a massive hit which got the home crowd even more fired up.However, a three point lead was scant reward for Ballynahinch after  minutes and Terenure began to turn the screw.They had a clear scrum advantage with referee Kieran Barry taking umbrage with Cullenrsquos angles and following a scrum deep in lsquoHinch territory, they went through the phases and eventually drove prop Liam Hyland over for a try at the posts to take a - lead.Moments later a superb long grubber kick forced Cairns back over his own line and Terenure won another penalty from the resulting m scrum.Declining the shot at goal they opted for another scrum and another infringement led to a penalty try, taking the lead out to - after  minutes.Undaunted, Ballynahinch finished the half strongly when a trademark Rhys OrsquoDonnell show and go sent him flying up the left touchline and almost over in the corner. Stout defending from Terenure averted the immediate danger, but a penalty for offside allowed OrsquoHagan to kick another penalty and cut the gap to - at half-time.As conditions worsened there was belief around the ground that this was not an insurmountable deficit, but disaster struck early in the first half when replacement Rankin elected to move the ball from deep.His long pass to a flying Ross Adair was only inches off target, but allowed the prolic Jake Swaine to hack through and win the race for the line to take his side  points clear at -. Ballynahinch refused to lie down and used the conditions to dominate field position.Blindside Aaron Hall put his injury nightmare behind by driving Terenure back at every opportunity and OrsquoHaganrsquos deadly boot dragged them back into the game with two penalties. When the under pressure Terenure outfit conceded another penalty in their own , almost everyone in the ground expected another three points.The ever-alert OrsquoDonnell had other ideas as he took a quick tap penalty and weaved his way over to score at the posts.OrsquoHaganrsquos conversion made it  all and as the weather really closed in, the home side were the clear favourites as they piled on the pressure in search of a win.Terenure defended well and were handed a leline when Cairns elected to run a speculative clearance instead of launching it back downfield.The ball was knocked on in the centre of the pitch and with heavyweight lock James Simpson off, the field Terenure once again exploited their scrum superiority to milk a penalty.Swaine held his nerve to nail the kick which, although central, was made tricky by the grim conditions.Ballynahinch threw everything at a tiring Terenure defence as the game entered injury time and after more than  phases of hammering away around the m line OrsquoHagan called for thegoal.The slippery conditions and heavy pressure meant his kick was a little rushed and it dropped short and wide to allow the away side to mark the ball and kick it out for a hard-earned win.The locals will reflect on a game they probably should have won, but will take an enormous amount of positives from the performance after visibly stepping up their physicality.Small margins will make a huge dference in this league and the fixtures come fast over the next few weeks. lsquoHinch travel to UCC this weekend to take on a student side buoyed by their demolition of much-fancied Trinity at the weekend and with the squad still thin due to Ulster Arsquos involvement in the Celtic Cup final, skipper John Donnan will have to lt his men for another big effort. However, he will be a happier man after his team showed that they belong in this company.Ballynahinch: Ben Cullen, Conor Piper, Johnny Blair, James Simpson, John Donnan , Aaron Hall, Olly Loughead, Conall Boomer, Rhys OrsquoDonnell, Sean OrsquoHagan, Aaron Cairns, Ryan Wilson, Stuart Morrow, George Pringle, Ross Adair.

We hope to find this litter new owners soon, so they can quickly adjust to being part of a loving family.“Canine carers at Dogs Trust Ballymena have found there is often misconceptions about the Lurcher breed, with people often thinking they require lots of exercise. Lurchers actually don’t require any more exercise than a typical dog and many enjoy staying cozy and snuggling up for a snooze.“At such a young age they will all need homes where they will be given lots of care and attention, as well as ongoing support with their training. Families who adopt any of the puppies will be invited to join Dogs Trust’s Dog School at ious locations across Northern Ireland.”Dog Trust’s Dog School was launched in  to support dog owners and their pets through our reward based training methods, teaching valuable skills needed for everyday le. Dog School is just as much about supporting and guiding owners as it is about training the dog. Classes run over five weeks and each dog owner will receive training homework after the class to practise at home.

He was all over it like a rash.”In , Moy Park had been bought by giant Brazilian meat processor Marfrig in a  million deal. But within just seven years, Moy Park’s valuation more than doubled.In September  – as Moy Park’s farmers were piling into RHI – the company was sold to another Brazilian meat giant, JBS.Andrew CrawfordLess than a year later, bribery charges – unconnected to the Moy Park sale – would begin to be levelled at senior JBS figures in a massive scandal which would shake Brazilian society.Moy Park has since been sold by JBS – but to a company which it controls, Pilgrim’s Pride, in a sale which attracted further allegations and litigation from shareholders.In , Mrs Foster travelled to Brazil on a trade mission. In her role as Stormont’s enterprise, trade and investment minister, one of her major engagements was with Marfrig. and Nigel Dodds\"   and Nigel Dodds\"  DUP department used public cash in threat to injunct News Letter – over its own leakIrish Premier Leo Varadkar to raise outcome of citizenship with Boris Johnson Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The book reveals Mrs Foster’s briefing notes, showing that on the night of May , she had been due to dine with Marfrig executives at the Michelin-starred Mani Manioca, one of Sao Paulo’s hippest restaurants.According to the briefing material, she was to conduct the key meeting – unusually – without her civil servants.It was the only event on the entire trade mission where one of Foster’s officials or an official from the British consulate did not accompany the minister.Only Dr Crawford and Invest NI chief executive Alastair Hamilton, a former DUP spad, were to be present. The unusual situation was justied on the basis that it was “to ensure that the two Marfrig representatives aren’t overwhelmed”.The purpose of the meeting was “to further discuss Marfrig’s presence in Northern Ireland”. When asked questions about the meeting, Foster and Crawford replied with a solicitor’s letter which did not answer the questions and failed to provide any explanation for what had gone on – but instead threatened to sue for libel.The letter also said that the meeting had been shted from dinner to breakfast and that the DUP figures “did not meet with Marfrig executives without officials present in order to ensure there was no minute of the meeting”.The letter added that a translator had been present, although it would not be the role of a translator to record a civil service minute of what transpired.Stormont’s rules state that departmental meetings with external iniduals must be minuted.When asked what she had done to ensure that an accurate record of the meeting was kept, Mrs Foster declined to respond.The year after Mrs Foster travelled to Brazil, Marfrig chief executive Sergio Rial said the company had “ongoing, positive engagement with the Northern Ireland Executive and have experienced a very pro-business attitude”.Responding to questions from the News Letter about why Mrs Foster met Marfrig executives without her civil servants being present, and what steps she had taken to ensure that an accurate record of what was discussed was kept, a DUP spokesperson said: “It would not be appropriate to comment on issues related to the work of the public inquiry before that process has been completed.”try catch  TrendingWrightbus: Green Pastures issue statement after bus building firm confirmed to continue in BallymenaN.I. hotel F**k the Pope and the I.R.A. wedding video reported to police -

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/2_web.jpg","title":"top  voice of business never stronger or more important","story":"Posted on Friday  September  by Ulster Business John Mulgrew, Michael Neill, Sarah Little and Len OHagan The voice of Northern Ireland’s business community has never been stronger and more important as industry attempts to avoid a hard Brexit, a gathering of top business leaders has heard. The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in . In its latest Northern Ireland Quarterly Sectoral Forecasts report, Danske Bank said that the Northern Ireland economy likely expanded in the second quarter of the year, but the rate of growth over the first half of the year remained modest. “We have revised our forecast for economic growth in Northern Ireland downwards for both  and ,” he said. “This largely reflects the modest data for the first half of the year, increased Brexit-related uncertainty and the weaker global economic environment. “Assuming that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, we expect the Northern Ireland economy to grow by .% in  and .% in , below the .% we expect UK GDP to grow by in both years. “A combination of strong wage growth and more stable inflation is likely to lead to solid growth in consumer spending, but the lack of clarity around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is expected to continue holding back business investment.” It says the information and communication, and professional, scientic  technical services sectors are expected to be the fastest growing parts of the economy over the next two years. Meanwhile, output in the construction sector is forecast to rise by .% in  and .% in , while expected output growth in the wholesale and retail trade sector has been revised down to .% in  and .% in . Public administration and defence is continuing to have the weakest outlook of all the sectors of the Northern Ireland economy, with output expected to contract by .% in , and by a further .% in . “Over the coming weeks, a number of potential Brexit options are possible, including a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of the Article  period or a general election,” Mr Lambe said. “Predicting what will happen next in the Brexit process is incredibly dficult, but businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/BOI11_web.jpg","title":"bank of ireland uk empowering colleagues to support local communities","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by Ulster Business Paul Slevin, Alison Mitchell, Ian Sheppard, Sally Irvine, Christine Graham and Paul Magee With a purpose to enable customers, colleagues and communities to thrive, Bank of Ireland UK staff are building on a long history of supporting local charities and community organisations. Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors.
