She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’. All civil servants must uphold the civil service code – which says workers must show integrity and professionalism while away from government – while on a career break. If these terms were broken, human resources would be notified and would launch an investigation.However, workers who keep to the terms may return to work as normal. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/21/4D633CF600000578-0-image-a-14_1529355138016.jpg","title":"Now thats royal tea party Meghan Markels dress Queens hat Eugenies frock","story":"    Say cheese, Ma\u0027am: The Queen wears a hat to match a Wedgwood cheddar dish at the polo on Sunday¿I¿ve changed my mind about Meghan¿s dad ¿ he¿s just a shy,...Share this article    Don\u0027t put it in the dishwasher: Meghan in her plate pattern dress at a wedding on Saturday          Spot the inspiration: Kate channels the Polka Dot china collection by Royal Vale          Someone\u0027s blossoming: Pregnant Pippa plumped for the delicate look of a flowery teacup at the Royal Wedding          Saucer sorcery: Camilla\u0027s jacket at yesterday\u0027s Order of the Garter Service nods to the Royal Albert Black Diamond pattern          I\u0027m a little teapot: Princess Eugenie\u0027s poppy outfit is as chintzy as this pot          Roses are red...

The criminals take the money and leave the victim with huge debts.Yesterday the Daily Mail found several forums littered with posts by fraudsters selling personal data.By putting into Google slang terms commonly used by online criminals to advertise the sale of stolen financial information, we found dozens of message boards.Many of them had been set up to discuss seemingly innocent topics such as handball, poker and Windsor Football Club. A post on the poker forum boasted the full personal details of a customer of the Co-operative Bank. It included the cardholder’s name, address and date of birth.Card numbers, email addresses, sort codes and account numbers, telephone numbers, card expiry dates and national insurance numbers were also found on these posts.On one website, we found a post by a hacker who claimed to have been stealing financial information for seven years. Last night, experts called on Google to take down the forums. Arun Chauhan, director of Tenet Compliance and Litigation, a law firm specialising in financial crime, said search engines such as Google had a ‘moral duty to step up and do something’.He added: ‘In the daily global fight against financial crime, it is crucial that banks and non-financial entities such as search engine providers that facilitate the passing and gathering of information and money take steps to prevent criminals from using them to commit fraud.’Angela Sasse, of the Research Institute in Science of Cyber Security, said: ‘If the details being shared are clearly only being used for criminal gain... the sensible thing would be to get the police involved to work with the search engines. Nazis head to Google Plus after Facebook and Twitter...Google is struggling to hold onto black and Hiic...Share this article\u0027It could be tempting for young people to get involved in this illegal activity.

Google has claimed that it is not responsible for the information found on its search engineNeil Hare-Brown, a cyber security expert, said fraudsters had moved their illegal activities to online forums because they had much more exposure to potential buyers.He added: ‘The dark web puts a lot of buyers off. It’s really slow and difficult to navigate and fraudsters know they won’t get as many sales.’Search engines such as Google could flag the slang terms and prevent the illegal activity, he added.Google has come under fire for allowing jihadi videos on its YouTube website, for cashing in on fake ticket-selling websites and failing to delete racist material.It has claimed that it is not responsible for the information found on its search engine.A Google spokesman said: ‘When we receive reports of pages that distribute personal data to facilitate identity theft or fraud, we remove these from “search” – full stop.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/00/4D6CBEFC00000578-5862983-image-m-26_1529449404758.jpg","title":"Adorable moment Lucy Dog Gus Dolphin strike unlikely friendship","story":"    A Rottweiler-Husky mix named Lucy is seen aboard her owner\u0027s charter boat befriending a dolphin named Gus           The  dolphin swims up next to the boat sailing from Captive Island, Florida, and gets Lucy\u0027s attentionShe posted the video titled \u0027Lucy and her friend\u0027 to Facebook, which has garnered more than 350,000 views since it was taken last month. In an interview with Naples Daily News, Gilchrist said Lucy has been coming on board since she was six months old. \u0027She\u0027s my best friend,\u0027 he added. Gilchrist even takes Lucy on his fishing excursions up to five days a week.  Wet and woof!

Pictured: McCartney\u0027s home Mrs Fenton lost a case brought against her by her neighbours in 2005 over her installation of fence panels on the shared garden wall.She won the next battle in 2015 when a judge ordered the Lewises to remove a roof from which water had flowed from their extension onto Mrs Fenton\u0027s property.They have since taken down the roof, but now plan to build an enlarged structure, which they say would finally solve the rainwater problem.Last year, an independent surveyor issued a Party Wall Award, which authorises them to raise the boundary wall to build their extension.But that only led the neighbours back to court, as Mrs Fenton launched her challenge to the surveyor\u0027s decision.  Sir Paul\u0027s home is separated from the two homes and is not involved Her barrister, Stuart Frame, claims that the Party Wall Award should be overturned as the wall in question is not actually shared.\u0027It is Mrs Fenton\u0027s case that the works authorised by the award cannot be executed due to the fact that the configuration of the walls in the immediate vicinity of the proposed works are not as assumed by the surveyor making the award,\u0027 he said.Mr and Mrs Lewis say their neighbour should not be allowed to argue that the wall is hers alone, claiming she agreed informally through solicitors 21 years ago that the boundary runs down the middle of the wall.She then stood by \u0027in silence\u0027 while the original extension was built off the wall, Mr Rainey told Judge Nicholas Parfitt.Much of her case also referred to the plan which contains the allegedly fraudulent annotations, indicating that Mrs Fenton owns the whole wall.\u0027The current proposed extension is by way of compliance with the order in 2015, requiring Mr and Mrs Lewis to replace the roof of their extension,\u0027 said Mr Rainey.\u0027The judge was told that if the roof had to come off, the opportunity would be taken to build the additional storey.\u0027Mrs Fenton has done everything in her power, including issuing these proceedings, to interfere with Mr and Mrs Lewis\u0027 attempts to comply with that order.\u0027The judge reserved his decision on the case until a later date."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/20/13/4D7178E700000578-5865049-image-a-53_1529496157385.jpg","title":"Japanese football fans tidy World Cup stadium 2 1 win Colombia","story":"    Japanese fans seemed to have brought rubbish bags with them as they filtered through the seats after the full-time whistle          Colombian fans could be seen standing on awestruck as several Japanese fans gathered up the mountain of litterSocial media users heaped praise on the supporters, saying they had set an example to fans of other countries.\u0027Wow!!

For now, you should register your phone number with the Telephone Preference Service online at tpsonline.org.uk or by calling 0345 070 0707.Once your number is on this list it is illegal for companies to cold call and try to sell you something.If caught, firms face a fine of up to £500,000 by the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.However, signing up won\u0027t stop all nuisance calls. The rules don\u0027t apply to call centres based abroad, and typically don\u0027t deter fraudsters who are breaking the law anyway.Help!

Check with our pension calculator    Criminal gangs  are scanning newspapers and websites for notices about deathsFraudsters are duping grieving widows out of their life savings by claiming to be clairvoyants who will contact their loved ones for a fee.Criminal gangs based overseas are scanning newspapers and websites for notices about deaths. They then ring widows and widowers or send them letters offering to help them speak to their dead spouse in return for a charge of between £10 and £50. In one case, a widow in her 70s received 15 such scam letters a week from crooks offering to contact her husband. Each time she would send £10 to £40 to the scammers — most of her disposable income — before Trading Standards intervened. Criminals sometimes also claim to be able to give victims winning lottery numbers, or offer to remove a curse.Anyone who receives a letter or call from someone claiming to be a clairvoyant should ignore it or report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.r.lythe@dailymail.co.uk                                                    Sky customers can sign up for its free Talk Shield service — but you must have both a landline and internet with the firm.This requires callers to state their name and where they are calling from before they can be put through. Then, instead of your phone just ringing, you will be played their message so you can decide if you want to pick up.If you don\u0027t want to answer you can refuse the call and put the number on your block list. Friends and family can be added to a list of safe callers so they will get through every time.For the service to work, you must have a home phone which displays the numbers of callers on a screen.TalkTalk offers its customers a similar service called CallSafe.It has a national database of known unwanted callers that it blocks from getting through, and you can add further numbers to the list.It also offers a service that will reject calls from anyone who withholds their number.TalkTalk automatically creates a list of approved callers from your regularly dialled numbers so friends and family members can get straight through.You may want to invest in a standalone call-blocking gadget such as a trueCall device.This is a small plastic device that plugs in between your phone and the wall socket.It also intercepts calls to request that the caller states their name before being put through, and you can add numbers to a block or safe list.If the caller refuses to state their name, your phone won\u0027t even ring as they will be blocked automatically.Trading Standards has a small number of these gadgets to give away for free, so call your local council to see if you qualify.          Fight back: Many major telecoms companies now offer their own call blocking services. If you are with BT, you can sign up for BT Protect    Report spam texts to your mobile company by forwarding the text to \u00277726\u0027Report spam texts to your mobile company by forwarding the text to \u00277726\u0027 free of charge.If you have an iPhone, hold your finger on the message until a menu pops up.Select \u0027more\u0027 and then look for the blue arrow in the bottom right hand side of your screen.Then enter the number 7726 and click send.You can also block the number so you do not receive any more messages.There\u0027s a blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 in it for information on the top right of the screen, within the nuisance message. Tap this, then the grey arrow in the top right — the list of options will include the choice to \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also report text messages online to the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office at ico.org.uk or by calling 0303 123 1113.The watchdog will ask you a series of questions such as what the text was about, whether you had a previous relationship with the firm that contacted you, and if the message worried you.You do not have to answer all the questions, but the more detail you can give the better.You can also report nuisance calls this way.However, scammers typically use multiple numbers so it\u0027s difficult to stop all spam texts from getting through.Many junk texts include an option to reply \u0027STOP\u0027 to prevent further messages. If you do so the company is legally required to stop sending marketing texts.But only do this if you are sure the message is from a legitimate company, such as your mobile provider or another firm you have dealt with in the past.If you are in any doubt, ignore it. Replying just confirms to the firm that your phone is active and they may hound you all the more or sell your number on to other crooks.Watch out for messages that appear to come from your bank or the taxman.Fraudsters are able to make it appear as though their text messages have been sent from a legitimate company.These spoof messages are often very convincing because they appear in the same thread as other genuine texts.To be safe, never click on any link or call a number given to you in an unexpected text message — even if it claims your account has been suspended or blocked.If you have any concerns call the phone number on the back of your bank card or statement.HM Revenue \u0026amp Customs says it will never contact taxpayers about refunds or request personal details by text message.It advises people to forward any suspicious messages to 60599 (there may be a small charge if you do not have free text messages as part of your contract).                                                    If you think the call was from a fraudster, report it to Action Fraud at actionfraud.police.uk, or by phoning 0300 123 2040. Blocking phone numbers on a smartphone is also easy. If you have an iPhone, for example, tap on the green square icon with a picture of a phone to pull up your recent calls list.There will be a little blue circle with an \u0027i\u0027 for information next to the nuisance caller\u0027s number.Tap on this, scroll to the bottom of the list of options and select \u0027block this caller\u0027.You can also download the free TPS Protect app which will help identify different types of nuisance calls.If a number is in the app\u0027s database because it\u0027s been reported by another user, a message will pop up telling you what type of company is calling.For example, it might say \u0027insurance\u0027 or \u0027PPI\u0027. It will also tell you if the number is a \u0027suspected scam\u0027. You can then reject the call and use your phone\u0027s settings to block it for ever.You can also report numbers by filling out a few details on the app, which will help other users. Details of reported calls will be passed on to the watchdog, the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office.The app also gives telephone numbers a \u0027trust score\u0027 of between one and five, where one is likely to be a scam and five a company with a low number of complaints.But these are not always accurate so stay vigilant.For 99p a month you can add numbers to an automatic block list so that your phone doesn\u0027t ring when they call.But remember, you can already do this for free as we explain above. With the more advanced version of the app you can also choose only to accept calls above a certain trust score.The app can\u0027t identify calls that come from a withheld number.Instead, you may want to decline them so they are erted to your voicemail.moneymail@dailymail.co.ukGood for big potsGood for big potsFee back in trades Compare the best investing platform for you"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/19/4D692C0700000578-0-image-m-36_1529434288688.jpg","title":"19 towns cities house prices risen 250 cent","story":"    Home values have risenHouse prices in 19 towns and cities have risen by more than 250 per cent since the Millennium.Southend-on-Sea in Essex saw the sharpest rise, with average prices up 287 per cent since 2000 according to Land Registry figures.Only two of the 19 towns and cities – Salford and Sale, both in Greater Manchester – were in the North of England.The research by HouseSimple, an online estate agent, excluded London from its findings.Four of the five biggest growth areas were in the East of England. House prices in Cambridge, Luton and Basildon rose by 279 per cent, 276 per cent and 274 per cent respectively.HouseSimple previously found that property prices in London have risen by 271 per cent since 2000.The highest gains were seen in the boroughs of Waltham Forest (364 per cent), Hackney (339 per cent) and Lewisham (331 per cent). Sam Mitchell, of HouseSimple said: ‘We wanted to look at how house prices had fared across the rest of the country, as London is often viewed as a stand-alone property market, but is not reflective of the UK as a whole.‘In the middle of this 18-year period, we experienced one of the worst recessions this country has ever seen.

More than 40 years after it first hit the newsstands, that image might be set to change, with a new issue created entirely by female writers, artists, colourists and letterers.The 2000AD sci-fi special includes Batgirl artist Babs Tarr illustrating a Judge Dredd story, graphic novelist Tillie Walden writing and drawing one of the comic’s famous Future Shock shorts, and Irish novelist and playwright Maura McHugh penning a story about Judge Anderson, Dredd’s telepath colleague.2000AD editor Matt Smith hopes the special will encourage more women to contribute to the weekly comic. “With an increasing number of female writers and artists finding work in 2000AD, I felt it was time to showcase women creators,” he said. “2000AD has a bit of a reputation as a boys’ club, but the truth is that I welcome pitches from everyone.”Although 2000AD has history employing women – notably Annie Parkhouse and Ellie de Ville, whose lettering has appeared in every issue over the last quarter of a century – they have not been at the forefront of its creative teams. Earlier this year, artist Emily Zeinner became the first woman to illustrate the cover since 1983, while 2000AD’s annual competition to find new writing talent was won last year by Laura Bailey – the first ever female winner.“If you open an issue and all you see are male names in the credit box, it might discourage some from approaching it. So I wanted to address that,” says Smith.2000AD’s flagship character is Judge Dredd, and in 2013 Emma Beeby became the first woman to write the future lawman patrolling the vast MegaCity One. “Judge Dredd is really fun to write,” she says. “He walks the line between hero and villain, comedy and horror. There’s something both disturbing and reassuring about getting into his head. I felt quite intimidated, being a woman writing such a legendary and masculine character, among all these male creators, but I was made welcome. It’s a great community of creators and fans and it feels like home to me now.”Tarr says it was “completely appropriate” for a comic with 2000AD’s longevity to focus an issue on women creators. “I think it’s a great move that says, ‘All are welcome.’ If it helps shine light on new and existing female creators then I’m happy to be a part of it!” she says.However, she hopes that the comics industry won’t “need niche things like ‘all-female’ specials to give girls jobs in comics” in the future – a sentiment echoed by artist Emma Vieceli, who worked on a Judge Anderson story for the special.“We nearly all strive toward a day when a publisher can do what 2000AD have boldly done here without the main push of the promotion being a discussion about the fact that it’s an all-female issue,” she says. “I can’t remember many comic books being promoted as ‘all-male’, after all, despite many being exactly that. Why would we care? Why do we care if it’s all-female? It really shouldn’t be seen as such an oddity.“One day, an issue like this will come along and the contributors will only be asked about their stories and process and not their gender.”• 2000AD sci-fi special is released in the UK on 20 June, with a July release in the US."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12bacf90173a4e95e506c0efb59958b3533c42d6/0_1161_5510_3306/master/5510.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7c44f4e7c2dfe55e48039d19d16d961","title":"ordinary people learn economics manchester classes","story":"In Manchester, groundbreaking economics courses are giving locals the means to challenge some of society’s received wisdom – for free. • Listen to Aditya Chakrabortty talking about game-changing economic models on The Alternatives podcastIn a makeshift classroom, nine lay people are battling some of the greatest economists of all time – and they appear to be winning. Just watch what happens to David Ricardo, the 18th-century father of our free-trade system. In best BBC voice, one of the group reads out Ricardo’s words: “Economics studies how the produce of the Earth is distributed.”Not good enough, says another, Brigitte Lechner. Shouldn’t economists study how to meet basic needs? “We all need a roof over our heads, we all need to survive.” Nor does the Earth belong solely to humans. Her judgment is brisk. “Ricardo was talking tosh.”So much laughter rings out of this room that the folk outside must wonder what’s going on. They’ve been told this is an economics course – and participants on those don’t normally dissolve into giggles.Inside, Pat Bhatt chimes in: “Everything you see around you comes from nature. That’s the basis of everything. Economics is the wrong word. It should be … ecolo-mics.”Ooohs and aaahs. “Very clever!” beams the facilitator Nicola Headlam and scribbles it down on the flipboard.“My work here is done,” replies Headlam. “I’ll get my\u0026nbspcoat.”Some days, democracy looks like a bashed-up ballot box. Some days, it looks like a furious demo. But on this sun-splashed weekday morning, democracy looks like this low-ceilinged meeting room in a converted church, slap bang in the middle of the road that runs from Manchester to Stockport.None of the “students” have ever picked up an economics textbook. At a guess, most would be either stumped or sedated by the Financial Times. Yet here they are, starting a crash course in something that to them is a mystery. The majority are retired, having worked their entire lives. But when asked how many of them feel some control over the economy, not one raises a hand. So who is in charge?“Journalists – who are paid by rich people.”Amid all the humour pokes a truth. For this group, economics is something that’s done to them, by people sitting far away in Westminster or the City. They bear the brunt of spending cuts they struggle with the rottenness of Northern Rail and they see neighbours sinking into debt – and they have no decent account as to why. They have been bashed over the head again and\u0026nbspagain, and not even been shown the offending\u0026nbspshovel.Over in the corner sits Sue O’Connor, who today comes “sponsored by Visa!” Another gentle joke that masks the debtor’s panic of having her disability benefit hacked back. Cancer meant she lost all her income and wound up in sheltered housing. Now 64, she suffers severe arthritis, yet her Motability car is about to be taken away.While at a secondary modern, her class was judged too thick to learn any maths. Partly because the teenager wasn’t taught to count, the grey-haired woman still feels she doesn’t count. “Information is power,” she tells the group. “If I can learn in this class, maybe others will listen to me.”More confident is 70-year-old “raging feminist” Lechner. “The economy is a system, right?” she says. “I understand systems like patriarchy and how it’s set so certain people get hurt … and I want to know how the rules of the economy are set.”Headlam nods: “Somehow, someone, somewhere made these rules up. They aren’t laws of nature.” And they determine “who’s got what and where and why”.That tearing sound you can hear is the veil that normally partitions economics from society and politics.Up till 2008, someone like O’Connor would have been told over and over that if she’d failed to get ahead it was her fault, not the system’s. She’d just not followed the rules. Then came the financial crisis, which turned into a crisis of economics.When the Queen famously asked why no economist saw the crash coming, she cut to the heart of the matter: perhaps those who wrote the economy’s laws and policed their observance weren’t so qualified after all. And while some practitioners claim that theirs is a semi-science, all prescriptions to revive the economy – from George Osborne’s historic austerity to the hundreds of billions doled out to asset-owners by the Bank of England – underline how it’s fundamentally political. By the time Michael Gove remarked in the Brexit campaign that “people in this country have had enough of experts”, he was picking a squelchy-soft target.One of the biggest battles over economics kicked off just up the road from this community centre. At the University of Manchester in 2013, economics undergraduates – tired of memorising abstract models while the eurozone burned – linked up with students from around the world to demand their economics curriculum be changed. Nothing beyond the orthodoxy of free-market economics was being taught no conflicting global developments, nothing of its critics such as Keynes or Marx, despite their contemporary relevance. Thus began an epic, and epically imbalanced, fight of a bunch of teenagers taking on the very professors marking their exam papers.Student passions usually fizzle out faster than you can say “snakebite and black”, yet a half decade on, the struggle to prise open economics has got broader. Those ardent undergraduates propping up the union bar are now civil servants pushing for change in government economics or they’re directing charities such as Economy, which is putting on this crash course in Levenshulme. The aim is to nail the format, then do 15 courses next year, partnering with housing associations, local authorities and others across the UK.As you might expect from the first session of the first course, this morning’s proceedings betray some nerves. In an ordinary jacket and denim skirt, Headlam tells the class: “We had no idea if you would come.” Unlike the brogue-wearing professoriat, she and her co-facilitator Anne Hines give no sense that they come from a distant planet. Tomorrow morning, former pharmacist Hines sits her own economics exam for an Open University degree course while Headlam, even with her doctorate, describes her academic career as making “target practice for the elite institutions”.The pair are giving their time for free, and attendees don’t pay a penny. Economy’s Clare Birkett put together the course and organised the pilots on a part-time wage. All five courses, each lasting up to two months and educating anywhere between 50 and 80 people, will together cost little more than the tuition fees for one solitary economics degree.A few academic economists will ask what authority a bunch of amateurs have, but Birkett has prepared her fighting talk: “If they say, ‘How dare you talk about this?’, I’ll say, ‘Why shouldn’t I? I’ve put in the work, I’ve studied these things. This stuff belongs to all of us.’”Short of paying nine grand a year for a degree, how else are lay people meant to find out about the most potent social science of all? The internet is full of blind alleys, while even public lectures within universities typically assume some prior knowledge. Given how some economists rage that they’re not listened to enough on issues such as Brexit, it’s notable how little\u0026nbspthey actually engage with the public (one excellent exception is the annual Bristol Festival of Economics).Not so long ago, a Levenshulme resident could learn economics – or any number of other subjects – through the adult evening classes offered by the University of Manchester. The extramural programme stretched as far afield as Wigan and Burnley, and by the 1970s employed more than 30 academic staff. Then followed decades of cuts, until the entire department was shut down in 2006.To make the economy more democratic, as everyone from Theresa May to Jeremy Corbyn proposes, we need to democratise knowledge of economics. That’s a truth now cottoned on to by organisations as disparate as the Bank of England and Momentum.Everyone here brings their own lived experience of economics. In her motorised wheelchair, Joanne Wilcock notes how “everything is much more expensive when you’re disabled”. Bang on, yet you hardly ever read that in an article on the latest inflation figures. Bhatt knows that Levenshulme is supposed to be gentrifying – “fancy cars, flash weddings” – but notices his neighbours can’t afford to do up their own houses. “All fur coat and no knickers!” he concludes, and the room cracks up.And if you’re expecting them to trot out the usual left-itudes about fixing the economy, you’re wrong. A discussion about Northern Rail does produce calls for nationalisation – but also arguments as to how it should be turned into a co-op, or run by an arms-length organisation of technocrats.Has you or your community come up with answers to doing things differently?

We’ll include some of your stories in our reporting.Lechner starts on about “citizen scientists” – amateurs who conduct their own experiments – and casts an eye around the room. “Why can’t we be citizen economists?”That may be the most radical suggestion of the day, because it cuts directly against how both right and left usually do their business. In 1894, the year before cofounding the London School of Economics, Fabian Beatrice Webb confided to her diary: “We have little faith in the ‘average sensual man’. We do not believe that he can do more than describe his grievances, we do not think he can prescribe his remedies … we wish to introduce into politics the professional expert.”That impulse may now be dressed up in polite euphemism – but it lives on. “So many thinktanks and MPs come up with good ideas to change our economy, but they’re all stuck in their political bubble,” says the head of Economy, Joe Earle. “Ordinary people barely get a say in the thing that rules their lives.”Contrast that with this class and its polite horizontalism, where no one is presumed to be a total expert and everyone is treated as if they have something valuable to say. It is the seeds of that ferment described by Hilary Wainwright in her recent book, A New Politics from the Left.Drawing on her experience of feminist and workers’ self-organisation, she writes: “Rebel movements shared and developed their own kinds of knowledge, via practice and through debate and deliberation, and on to producing new ideas and the basis of new institutions. Authority, once it has been confidently questioned by those on whose obedience it depends, crumbles in ways that make it difficult to put back together again.”At the end of the class, each participant tells the rest the best thing they have learned. There’s a pause when it gets to Aklima Akhter, who only came to this country in 2013 and has been sitting so benignly quiet in her white headscarf. She starts haltingly: “It is difficult for me, you know … the subject, the language.”All around her are faces pursed in little moues of encouragement, but then Akhter speeds up with\u0026nbspfluency. “But my favourite word was ‘nationalisation’. Because when things are privatised it is the rich who get all the benefit.” And for once in this room, no one is laughing.• Aditya Chakrabortty is senior economics commentator for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aac01a5c709094760119a7143752baa7688f48e4/0_99_5068_3041/master/5068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99552e406f8aef4f140419e2113bce0f","title":"predicted grades a levels universities admissions students","story":"Hunched over on dirty stairs, surrounded by other students either crying or squealing, I struggled to open the envelope because my hands were shaking so much. The page inside listed grades of A, A and B. It took me several long, confused seconds to process that these were my A-level results. Just two years earlier, I’d been told me to expect – and apply to university on the basis of getting – CCD.Predicting grades is obviously a flawed science. In some cases, predictions are made by overworked teachers who have only known the student for a matter of weeks before they make them. Yet for decades, poor predictions have had the power to damage young people’s motivation and stunt their futures. I know from experience that poor predicted grades can work as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many of my friends were, like me, predicted low grades, and in the months that followed I saw them become increasingly disillusioned. Some even dropped out of sixth form, seeing no point in studying for a further 18 months if they weren’t going to get into a good university. It was only thanks to supportive, academic parents, and my own tenacity, that I persevered.Despite my low predicted grades, I went to the Royal Holloway, University of London open day and fell in love with its grand, beautiful Founder’s Building. Born in Rotherham and raised in Doncaster, I was desperate to experience living and studying under the shadow of such a landmark. Because of my predictions, the admissions team requested I find a teacher to write a letter stating that they believed I could achieve the minimum admissions grades of ABB if I was going to make this my first choice.I talked to all five of my A-level teachers, but only one agreed to go against what the official predictions stated. There’s a good chance that he set my life on the course it ended up on. Without that letter, that vote of confidence, I wouldn’t have been made a conditional offer by Royal Holloway. Even though I went on to achieve AAB later that year, it would have been too late.This is particularly problematic for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Young people with huge potential but low predictions stand little chance of serious consideration from top universities, especially when pitted against students from schools that overpredict grades.Instead, we need to switch to a post-qualification admission system, which is based on real rather than predicted A-level grades. Of a group of 30 countries, including Japan, the US and France, only England, Wales and Northern Ireland use a predicted grades system when it comes to university offers. It is not just backed by UCU, but by the Sutton Trust, a foundation focused on improving social mobility, and by the Association of School and College Leaders.It’s not the first time this has been on the table. A government review recommended changing to a post-qualification system back in 2004. In 2011, the university admissions service Ucas put forward its own proposals for reforming the system, but dropped them in the face of lack of enthusiasm from universities.But surely modern technology would allow Ucas to conduct the admissions cycle within a period of weeks if results were released earlier in the summer, and freshers’ first term at university began a couple of weeks later. It would indeed be a big shift for universities and their culture, practices and mindset. But it should be one they are willing to make if they are truly committed to ensuring higher education is accessible to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f28f3e6eba791028f2b89d027ba8a31aeb29253b/0_120_1570_942/master/1570.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50ecb6450532d22330b5b0211bdd4639","title":"president macron double standards france","story":"Emmanuel Macron has been called many things. To the French media, he is sometimes “Jupiter” or “Napoléon” to his opponents, he is the “president of the rich”, after his liberal policies that tend not to favour the poor and some MPs, disturbingly enough, nickname him “Choupinet” (“Poppet”). But he would like to be called “Mr President”.At the annual commemoration of Charles de Gaulle’s 1940 appeal to the French resistance on 18 June, Macron served a daring teenager who made the mistake of greeting him with a “How’s it going, Manu?” with a severe dressing-down.The young man, who was attending the event at Mont-Valérien near Paris – a fort where members of the resistance were executed during the second world war – had sung the beginning to L’Internationale, using the socialist anthem as an ironic reference to Macron’s liberal reforms of the French labour market. The president, speaking in a sharp, angry tone, continued: “You must do things in the right order. The day you want to start a revolution, you first obtain a degree and learn how to feed yourself, OK? Then you can lecture others.”The video of their exchange was then posted on Mr President’s Twitter account, with the caption: “Respect is a minimum in the republic”. It quickly went viral, and the whole world witnessed France’s president publicly humiliating a teenager.But does Macron really hate nicknames or informality? Mr President can be very familiar with his staff: they affectionately call him “le boss”. He says “tu”, the informal French “you” to many politicians, including Vladimir Putin. As a young minister, Macron would start texts to colleagues with the catchphrase: “Salut ma poule, c’est Manu” (“Hey, love, it’s Manu”). Macron can be “Manu”, but only when he decides so.On 14 May 2017, “Manu” became Mr President. In a little over a year as president, Macron has demonstrated his love for power symbolism, of which formal address is an essential part. After a general spoke publicly of his dissatisfaction at the army’s share of the budget last year, Macron bluntly reminded French troops that he was their “boss”.But the teenager’s dressing-down comes as the president himself has been criticised for using insensitive language: in the past, he has called abattoir workers “illiterate”, protesters against his labour law reforms “slackers”, and has said that employees fired from a company should look for a job instead of “wreaking havoc” (“foutre le bordel”, a coarse expression best translated as “making a fucking mess”). Just last week, he was filmed complaining that the French welfare state costs a “crazy amount of dough”. (Each time, Mr President admitted his words had been blunt, but stood by his remarks.)During his visit to the US in April, he told American students: “You don’t always have to follow the rules. That’s bullshit!” Yet the rules, apparently, still apply if you are French.Macron campaigned on a young and ostensibly “cool” platform – his team, full of 20-somethings, ruled social media and were all fluent in English. Now, as president, Macron has cut housing aid for students, made university selective, and lectured youngsters on how to address him. The double standard is confusing to young people: are they to think he is an accessible president they can address as “tu”, or is he as strict and close-minded as previous ones? Does he want a “startup nation”, or is he too attached to ancient institutions?It’s especially tone-deaf because “Manu” is a positive nickname. It’s shorthand for the nice kid who smokes weed, or the friendly, guitar-playing camp counsellor – someone young, someone cool, someone who gets it, man. In fiction and popular culture, “Manu” is always the best friend – from kids’ comic character Titeuf to the eponymous 1980s song, an ode to friendship by singer Renaud. A teenager calling Macron “Manu” doesn’t constitute disrespect: his warm casualness conveys affection, it addresses the president’s most “normal” side. Maybe that is why Macron, who has worked hard to break from his predecessor, “normal president” François Hollande, didn’t appreciate the banter.Mr President’s harsh words have made one thing very clear: he is not your mate at all.• Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Britain.

The Gambling Commission estimated that more than 100,000 students are in debt due to their habit, with one in four of those indebted beyond £10,000.Stopping gambling is more difficult than it might seem. Online bookmakers have plied ex-gamblers with targeted ads attempting to lure them back, while thousands of people who self-excluded have still been able to access their accounts. Meanwhile, there is precious little support for this type of problem on university campuses, beyond traditional counselling. The issue was highlighted by the NUS last month when it partnered with Gamban, an app which blocks gambling sites. Here, three ex-students describe how they became addicted to gambling at university and what can be done to prevent more young people falling into the trap.I would lose my student loan almost as soon as I received it. Hours of free time during the day at university did not suit me well. Every man and his dog in my year gambled it was so widespread that among a group of friends you may be the odd one out if you haven’t had a flutter on a game you were watching. Soon, that bet on the football becomes an expensive, drunken night at the casino that you regret the next day. Then you’re always trying to make your losses back.The late night rollercoasters of online gambling and casino trips took their toll and led to me not attending classes at university at all. You get depressed and it’s all downhill from there. Losing the money I relied on to live made university seem pointless and it altered my mindset to such an extent that I didn’t care about my education anymore. They were dark days and it still runs deep.I ended up dropping out of university and working full-time to pay back thousands of pounds of debt. A large student debt was bad enough, but when that is coupled with payday loans, credit card and overdraft debt with a much closer deadline it really doesn’t put you in very good stead for normal life.Gambling addiction can be hidden and lied away. I compulsively lied to family and friends to borrow money. I think universities should offer Gamblers Anonymous meetings. I was unable to get to a GA until after I dropped out, which delayed my recovery.I self-excluded from websites throughout uni, which did stop me gambling with that specific company – but there is always another bookie lurking around the corner. I also self-excluded from a casino but soon after, due to regulatory changes, you didn’t have to give a name so there was never a doubt that I would be able to enter.I gambled as a form of escapism. I was incredibly bored and, on a deeper level, I wanted to distract myself from being emotionally honest because I wasn’t at all happy at university.Universities need to be much more proactive in preventing addiction taking root. They need to raise gambling to the same level of conversation as that which already exists for drugs and alcohol on campus.The poker society I was part of was offered £100,000 in bonuses from gambling sites in exchange for sponsorship. Yet there were no guidelines from the university or union with how to deal with these approaches – they are designed to get people addicted, not to help a fledgling poker society pay for blazers. I ended up losing more than £20,000.Gambling is a distraction from everyday life. It’s like being in another universe. Theoretically, you are able to control events at a poker table, where you’re able to make controlled decisions – such as wagering a certain bet, at a certain time, in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. That’s a relieving feeling in the modern world.As a problem gambler you don’t set out to lose money, what you’re doing is spending an amount you’re comfortable wagering, and if you lose that, for some people it ends there. It’s when £20 – which could be considered light entertainment – becomes £100, or £1,000 and soon you’re playing catch up to make back your losses. That’s why the bookies offer you a free £10 here, a free £20 there, because they know it gets people hooked.Gambling addicts need the ups and downs of it, the ecstasy and excitement of winning and the crippling agony of losing. Flirting with the two is the thing that makes gamblers tick. The activity is one thing but it’s what it’s doing with your brain that’s the main thing. For me, I would rather have been losing and playing than not playing at all because if you’re trying to escape from your own mood, you would take the low – over the absence of a low. Left untreated, addicts seek a higher thrill – by betting more money – to get that euphoric, dopamine-driven high again.I remember one day I played for 14 hours straight. There’s always a game of poker going on online and if you’re really into poker, why wouldn’t you play? I now have a piece of gambling exclusion software on my computer which helps me fight the urge to play.When you don’t have much money, it sometimes seems that you don’t have much to lose. Most gambling today is intertwined with compulsive smartphone usage as most betting is now done at the touch of a button. This is partly why it is a growing problem.I played online poker over a long period. But because my losses were broken up by big wins, it took longer to see my behaviour as problematic and that it massively impacted all areas of my life. I had developed a serious gambling problem while I was at university. For me, becoming addicted was an incremental process. I started playing for pennies and at the end I was losing £1,500 in a single hand.It’s an addiction that doesn’t at first have any visible effects and can be hidden by people who want to keep their gambling secret. Therefore, universities need to offer support in the same way they do in other areas because there is currently little to no support for this type of addiction.Gambling at university was a burden that I, and many others, could easily hide. I certainly didn’t contact my university about my problem so more education on the addiction and visibility would help.I attempted to self-exclude many times but often relapsed. The self-exclusions can be undermined by making new accounts, but this could easily be solved if every site required a picture of a passport and there was a central database of excluders.It was only when I had a total block put on my devices, with the password held by my mother, that I was able to get over my gambling addiction. Eventually, I only avoided bankruptcy when my parents bailed me out of several thousand pounds of payday loan debt."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8ccc8d64a0acb3188844a3ddf53a4a5df643423/0_112_5256_3153/master/5256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb0000ec43446324c48459c593759c84","title":"a world without puffins the uncertain fate of the much loved seabirds","story":"On the small Welsh island of Skomer, puffin numbers are booming. But in former strongholds in Scotland, Norway and Iceland, the picture is ever more worryingBryony Baker lies spreadeagled at the edge of a cliff and reaches her hand deep into a hole in the ground that is almost entirely hidden beneath a clump of grass. She pushes futher in and her arm disappears up to the shoulder. It is a little like watching a vet getting up close and personal with a labouring cow. “Ouch!” she exclaims suddenly, her face creasing in pain. She pulls her arm out and inspects her fingers, already covered in scars. “That one’s definitely a puffin. They look sweet, but they can be pretty aggressive.”She presses her lips together in anticipation of another nip and pushes her hand in again. A large, dirty white egg emerges from the burrow – “warm, good” – and she places it safely on a cushion of moss. She reaches into the ground again. When she withdraws it, a second later, she’s holding an irritated puffin by its orange beak. She rings it, notes its number – this is now Bird EZ88918 – then gently replaces it and its precious egg in the burrow.Baker, who is funded by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, is this year’s seabird researcher on Skomer island, a remote wildlife haven off the west coast of Wales, which is managed for seabird conservation by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW).By late May, the island is covered in a violet haze of bluebells mixed with red campion. Together with its neighbouring island Skokholm, Skomer is home to the highest concentration of Manx shearwaters in the world. But here on the narrow, high isthmus of land that still just connects Skomer’s main landmass to a smaller outcrop known as The Neck, it is puffins (a type of auk) that are in the ascendant. With this year’s count recording nearly 31,000 iniduals, up from 14,000 in 2013, breeding adults are even starting to encroach into what were once “Manxie” burrows.“We need to be cautious. We might have had an optimal day for counting them this year,” observes Eddie Stubbings, one of Skomer’s two wardens. But whatever the exact number, there is now a housing problem on the slopes where puffins hang out in the brilliant late-afternoon sunshine. A puffin takeover has begun in earnest. This involves the portly little birds marching into shearwater burrows and determinedly dragging out the hapless inhabitants. Graceful in the air but helpless on land, the shearwater becomes easy prey for hungry gulls. Bird EZ88918 is one of three puffins Baker discovers today that have commandeered burrows known previously to have been home to a pair of breeding shearwaters.The apparently rude health of this Welsh puffin population is in marked contrast to the species’ catastrophic decline in what were once thriving colonies on Shetland. The RSPB’s seabird specialist Dr Ellie Owen confirms that on 20 monitored sites across Shetland, the 33,000 puffins counted in the last nationwide census in 2000 have plummeted to just 570 iniduals.  A Further afield, these auks are also in dire straits: Norway has seen vertiginous crashes, with hundreds of thousands of adult puffins in the once-teeming colony of Røst struggling to fledge any chicks in recent years.Working out the reasons behind the dramatic seesawing in the populations of this seabird – as well as why there have recently been devastating declines in some other seabird species, such as kittiwakes – is now exercising the brains of seabird scientists across the country.Seabird counts have, for example, revealed the magnitude of climate-change effects – “even though, when monitoring started, no one had heard of it,” says Prof Tim Birkhead of Sheffield university. He has been monitoring the population and breeding success of another British auk numerous on Skomer, the guillemot, for four decades. Climate change has warmed the oceans, and scientists suspect that this is forcing cold-water fish species further north, meaning, in turn, that seabirds struggle to find food close to their traditional breeding grounds. “It’s only if you have accurate knowledge of what is happening to bird populations that there is any chance of taking action,” says Birkhead.Seabird scientists regard puffins – which in the breeding season are the only species to return to land with fish very visibly held in their beaks, as long as there are fish to be found – very much as coalminers used canaries. “Puffins are seen as ocean sentinels – their survival and breeding success is indicative of the health of the ecosystem they depend on,” observes Dr Matt Wood, senior lecturer in biosciences at the University of Gloucestershire. Wood, who works with the WTSWW to coordinate the seabird counts on Skomer, notes that continued monitoring is essential, given that puffins are now on the British Trust for Ornithology’s red (endangered) list. “Seabird populations do not just change this rapidly unless something strange is happening,” he says. Puffins are long-lived birds, that raise just one chick a year and the ongoing viability of a colony depends on a delicately balanced marine habitat. In short, this means sandeels, the small, oily fish that are a staple diet for many seabirds, need to be in the right place at the right time for puffins to be able to feed their chicks. Not enough sandeels, or sandeels that have moved too far away from puffins’ breeding grounds, and their pufflings will starve to death in their burrows. He is puzzled that there has been little action or policy response from the government to the plight of Scotland’s puffins. Just four key seabird sites in the UK – Skomer, the Isle of May, Fair Isle and Canna – receive government funding for seabird monitoring and, a lack of resources delayed the 10-yearly seabird count for several years. “ The trawling of millions of tonnes of small oily fish, such as sprats and sandeels, for farmed fish and animal feed is another human impact that has denuded once prey-rich seas of the sustenance on which all seabirds rely. Birkhead was so alarmed by the recent loss of funding for his uniquely long-lived Skomer study that he has resorted to crowdfunding to meet the cost of training and paying researchers so it can continue.Puffins have two distinct phases of their lives: four months on land to breed, with the rest of the year spent out at sea. So, the wider challenge of protecting puffins, says Wood, is that they need the north Atlantic ocean to be healthy enough to support the fish stocks on which they feed all year round. And while researchers stand a decent chance of counting seabirds when they are near their breeding colonies, working out where they are feeding while out at sea, what kind of fish they are catching and where in the water column those fish are shoaling, is far more difficult (for which, read expensive). Meanwhile, there is widespread concern that climate change could be affecting seabird survival in a variety of subtle and intermeshing ways.While the Skomer puffins may be sitting pretty, anxiety about their less fortunate cousins is now so urgent that researchers and environmental organisations are pulling out the stops to find out what interrelated factors could lie behind the fluctuating numbers. Puffin specialist Dr Annette Fayet from the University of Oxford is about to follow up her recent study tracking overwintering puffins out at sea by attaching tiny GPS locators weighing just four grams – and costing £700 apiece – on to the backs of Skomer puffins to work out exactly where they are fishing for food for their young. Funded by National Geographic and Sky, she will be doing the same at puffin colonies in Iceland and Norway, where populations have also noseed. Her results, she hopes, will influence governments’ marine policies. While the ultimate goal would be to get governments to address the deeper causes of climate change – maybe in time to save the planet – it is perhaps more realistic to hope that politicians may one day be brave enough to set up extensive fishing bans in areas where seabirds go to feed.At the RSPB, Owen is bidding for funding to extend the scope of the charity’s Project Puffin initiative, which ran last summer. It combined tracking of puffins in the Shiant Isles and Shetland with crowdsourced “citizen science” information on the species securing the new funding would allow teams of trained researchers to source data on where puffins are feeding all around the UK, and from Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands. Working at this sort of scale is exciting, Owen explains. “If you can standardise monitoring methods across a big area, the data becomes very powerful.”There is no doubting the dedication of the researchers on Skomer, or their determination to secure the best information about what is happening to the seabirds who return each spring and work hard to fledge their single chick. After a 17-hour day mostly spent crawling on her hands and knees, being bitten by shearwaters and pooed on by puffins, Baker will get up again at 5.30am to attempt to ring lesser black-backed gulls. After lunch on the hoof, she will go out again, among the puffins and the shearwaters, and she will spend the evening on painstaking data entry. It all helps to build a consistent record of seabird activity on this magical Welsh island, the sloping grassy cliffs of which are, this summer, stuffed with puffins.Everyone is hoping that it stays that way – and that Scotland’s puffin numbers revive. For now, though, if you want to be sure of seeing a puffin in all its breeding glory, you might want to head west."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b973c9b26afc40a7bbaa8c4d4112809a9ddb54ee/0_149_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb82ae158b23a8d586ec1ca5406de9ac","title":"barnacled angels the whales of stellwagen bank a photo essay","story":"Off the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayOff the tip of Cape Cod, pods of humpbacks return every summer to feed. For the past 18 years,  Philip Hoare has been joining them to witness this incredible displayAt the tip of Cape Cod, a sandy spit reaches out into the Atlantic, like an arm, towards a vast underwater plateau where humpbacks gather each summer to feed. This is the US marine sanctuary of Stellwagen Bank, where for the past three weeks I’ve been a guest on the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch boats, working out of Provincetown. I’ve been coming here for 18 years it’s where I learned about whales. I’m inordinately fond of these animals and like me, they come back here too. Every spring, the whales return from their mating grounds in the Caribbean where they’ve spent the winter, fasting: those clear blue waters hold no sustenance for a whale. The grey-green seas of the Cape are filled with food: the cycle of upwelling nutrition feeds phytoplankton, that feed zooplankton, that feed the sand-eels, that feed the whales. They’re unconcerned by the clouds of gulls that follow them, in the same cycle, after the same food – even stealing fish out of the whales’ mouths. Like other rorqual whales, humpbacks’ throats expand in rubbery pleats reaching down to their navels. Opening their mouths wide, they strain their food using the strips of baleen – made of keratin, the same substance found in human fingernails – that hang from their upper jaws. Humpbacks co-operate in one of the most spectacular sights in the natural world. Blowing precisely calibrated streams of bubbles from their mouths, they swim round in circles, creating curtains of air around their prey. Then they rise, open-mouthed like giant crows. As they do so, they seem to alter the shape of the water itself. This whale is thwacking its tail up and down in behaviour known as lob-tailing. But only the humpbacks of Stellwagen Bank use another technique, ‘kick-feeding’, to stun their prey. It’s learned, local culture.This may be the most closely studied population of great whales in the world. The Provincetown Center for Coastal Studies (PCCS) was founded in 1976 to observe and document these animals. At that time, whaling was still widely practised. A veteran captain of the Dolphin Fleet told me that back in the 1960s, one Provincetown diner used to serve humpback steaks. With the advent of the Dolphin Fleet whalewatch, founded in 1975 by the Avellar family (Portuguese in descent, like many of the fishing community in Provincetown), commerce was allied with science. With naturalists on the boats, PCCS was able to gather an immense database, sustained by tourist dollars. The result is a catalogue of 2,000 inidual whales. One of the first to be named, Salt, has had 14 calves, and is now a great-grandmother.  Humpbacks have unique black and white patterns on the underside of their flukes, enabling the identification of inidual animals. Each receives non-gender-specific names not because Provincetown is a gender-fluid town – which it certainly is – but because it is difficult to sex a whale.This whale is an exception. She’s displaying her genital mound, which is usually impossible to see.Some whales are truly striking. This speckled female has been called Ventisca –Spanish for “snowstorm”. She’s one of the first whales I ever saw, back in 2000. She’s a popular performer, partial to rolling on her back. Humpbacks show no fear of the whalewatch boats. These whales may also be among the most habituated to humans. Sometimes on the boat we joke that we’re providing a ‘human watch’ for whales. As to what they really make of us, we may never know. Dennis Minsky, veteran naturalist on the Dolphin Fleet, has a wild theory. “Every day I announce a whale’s name over the tannoy system,” he says. “If my dog Dory recognises her name, what’s to say these whales don’t?” This whale rose perpendicularly through the water to peer at us. It’s called “spy-hopping” to me it looks like curiosity. Fascinated by whale-human culture, Minksy has compiled a “whalewatch glossary” of terms used by the captains. A breaching whale is a “Hail Mary”. Irritating leisure craft are generically “plastic”. It’s a sort of update on Moby-Dick. With more swear words.Fin whales – the next biggest animals on Earth after blue whales – also scythe through these waters. Vast and enigmatic, nicknamed the greyhounds of the sea, they can reach 24 knots, as fast as our boat. They have uniquely asymmetrical markings – pale on one side of their bodies, dark on the other. They use the white side to scare fish with a sudden flash – then gulp down their prey. A pair of lunge-feeding fin whales once lurched so close to our prow that our captain, Todd Motta, shouted, “Whoa!”, But far from colliding with us, they seemed to be using our boat as a fish-stop. On calm days, this ocean becomes hypnotic. Below its silvery surface - which Herman Melville called “the ocean’s skin” - white-sided dolphin surfed into view, leaping and foraging around the whales. They’re beautifully marked, with grey and mustard stripes that seem to streamline their bodies. One came close to the boat, visible through that watery skin like a super-realist art work by Gerhard Richter.  Of all great whales, humpbacks are most prone to breaching. No one knows why. Are they trying to dislodge troublesome parasites or communicating with other whales? Anyone who sees a 15-metre whale launch itself out of the ocean is sure of one thing: it looks like fun. Melville observed of the humpback: “He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them.” As this calf leapt, it looked close to landing on a dolphin. Hanging there in the air, a humpback demonstrates its kinship with us. No whale so well deserves its binomial: Megaptera novaeangliae – “big-winged New Englander”, a barnacled angel.• With grateful thanks to the Dolphin Fleet, its crew and its naturalists.Philip Hoare’s RisingTideFallingStar (4th Estate) is published this month in paperback.

Here’s what the current row tells us about clothes, power and shameWhat can I wear to prevent anyone taking a photo of my crotch at a festival?Mary, by emailA vagina. As most of us now know, the practice of “upskirting” – taking a photo of a woman’s crotch without her consent – has now become so widespread that one young woman, Gina Martin, felt compelled to launch a bill to make it illegal after some troglodyte upskirted her in Hyde Park. But, as most of us also now know, a Tory MP, one Sir Christopher Chope, blocked this bill’s progress – not, he has been crossly saying ever since, because he is such a fan of seeing random strangers’ crotches. No, he is just upset about the legislation process, you see. And truly, who could doubt the strong good morals of Sir Christopher Crotch? OK, so he voted against same-sex marriage and against the equal pay bill, he referred to parliamentary staff as “servants” and, just to add the toxic cherry on top, charged £881 to his parliamentary expenses for repairing his sofa. And yes, on the same day he blocked the upskirting bill, he also blocked a bill to protect police dogs and horses. But this is all because he is such a morally upstanding kinda guy.And speaking of upstanding, let’s talk upskirting. It says a lot about how little people care about female consent that they haven’t been angrier about this before now, because it is not like upskirting has been a secret – upskirt shots of celebrities have been in the tabloids for decades. In fact, most of us have borne witness to the most notorious upskirt shot of all time, when Paul Verhoeven tricked Sharon Stone into taking off her underwear for the shooting of one infamous scene. Verhoeven promised Stone that nothing would be visible, only for Stone to realise too late that Verhoeven had not just upskirted her, but was putting the results in every multiplex around the world.Maybe people told themselves that upskirting happens because women – those silly women! – insist on wearing skirts so short it turns the world into their gynaecologist, to quote the eternally quotable Patsy from Ab Fab. Those poor photographers – those women will not stop shoving their gussets in their lenses.A lawyer, Nick ‘Mr Loophole’ Freeman, brought the noble Freeman name into disrepute last weekend when he tweeted: “While this is totally unacceptable conduct, if women assumed some responsibility for their attire, they would not be in jeopardy.” This point was so absurd even Freeman’s daughter, Sophie,  replied to her father to tell him that this was “one of the top 3 stupidest comments you’ve ever made.” Nick then replied, wrongly: “it’s most stupid, not stupidest”. And that, Nick, goes into your top four.Last month, I saw some paparazzi using selfie sticks to take upskirt shots of young women leaving a movie premiere, and some of those women were wearing dresses so long the photographer had to wiggle his selfie stick under their hems, which were literally dragging on the ground.So shall we get something straight? Upskirting – like all forms of sexual assault, which is what upskirting is – has nothing to do with a woman’s hemline, but everything to do with that woman possessing genitals. And that’s because sexual assaults have nothing to do with sex. There is nothing sexy about a blurry camera phone shot of an oblivious stranger’s vagina, unless you find humiliation sexy. This is about young women being shamed for going out and having fun, and men wanting to tell them they have power over them. It’s telling that the kind of men who victim-shame are the kind who patronise their own daughters.A couple of years ago, there was some talk about whether it’s possible to tell a funny rape joke. To date, only Wanda Sykes has managed it, with her riff about how vaginas should be detachable so women could go out at night and not risk rape. Now we know another factor in favour of the detachable vagina, which is that women can go to Hyde Park and not have a stranger’s phone camera act like a speculum on her anatomy. So until the upskirt bill passes, I urge Sir Christopher to investigate detachable vaginas. We could even refer to them as our “chope” in his honour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd9d2efd0634fbb280ad1897f22c312720dafa08/0_555_2800_1680/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c97bc054cb65815547c3f86191a975f","title":"christopher plummer interview roseanne boundaries","story":"The Oscar-winning actor talks about replacing Kevin Spacey, why he finds marijuana boring and how he’s grown to stop hating The Sound of MusicJack Jaconi, the geriatric weed dealer played by Christopher Plummer in new indie dramedy Boundaries, sees life through the rearview. This is true in the literal sense – the film follows Jack and his adult daughter Laura (Vera Farmiga) on a cross-country relocation after his entrepreneurial streak gets him expelled from his retirement community – but this journey has a deeper elegiac energy to it, taking Jack on a tour through a past dotted with mistakes and regret.“There’s a lot of reflection to it,” Plummer muses, from the plush theater in the basement of New York’s Crosby Street hotel. “There’s a similar reflective quality in each role I take on these days.”Plummer has started to gravitate towards lions in winter, men approaching a hard-won repose after a life rich with experience. At 88, having conquered acting under every imaginable criterion, it’s not hard to see why. While his quick wit and throaty laugh betray an intact sense of vitality, Plummer has truly seen it all. By his own description, he sounds like Alexander, surveying the enormity of his kingdom and wondering what challenges might lie beyond the horizon: “I’ve done things that I’ve been proud of. I’ve managed to finish the cycle of the great, classic roles. I’ve played them all, some more than once. That’s out of my way now – I’d like to see women come and play them. But the parts I’m receiving in films now are wonderful, the last 10 parts have all been fascinating.”With everything from Cyrano de Bergerac to Shakespeare under his belt, Plummer’s entered a new phase of his career defined by introspection and the elusiveness of closure. Boundaries finds Plummer playing against type, relaxed and caddish instead of prim and proper, the kind of post-hippie relic liable to fire up a vape pen with an old pal played by counter-culture icon Peter Fonda. (For the record, Plummer doesn’t touch the stuff himself: “I stuck to booze, thank you very much, didn’t have anything to do with the drug world. I tried marijuana once – put me to sleep. I found it so boring!”)Jack’s also a petty crook, a negligent father and a pathologically selfish manipulator. As Laura flounders in her own efforts at self-improvement, she plumbs the depths of her father’s dysfunction and gains new insight on just how poor an example he’s set for her. The film’s primary arc is less about whether Jack can still find redemption himself, and more about whether he’s even interested in trying.As a callous man plotting his final chapters, Jack offers a natural point of comparison with tight-fisted billionaire J Paul Getty, a role that presented Plummer with one of those tests of skill he’s been searching for. Plummer made headlines last winter when director Ridley Scott tapped him to replace a disgraced Kevin Spacey in All the Money in the World, a retelling of the 1973 kidnapping that opened a bitter rift in an American oil dynasty. Plummer signed on the dotted line weeks before the film’s scheduled premiere, a turnaround rate all but unheard of in an industry with slow-turning wheels. Ever the consummate professional, Plummer made it work and picked up an Oscar nomination along the way.“I had a wonderful time!” he says. “At first, I was just concerned, ‘Am I going to be able to remember all this?’ because I had no time to study my lines. I had one or two days before we hit England. To my great relief, I found that I could manage. Everything was made very comfortable by Ridley, he wanted to make everything as easy as possible, for which I’m very grateful. But he also has a real sense of risk, clearly, and he loves doing things he’s not sure he’ll pull off.”That risk had a fitting reward, netting Plummer awards attention and an unlikely bump in his online profile as the new go-to guy to step in for any and all fired actors. “At the time, I thought, ‘What am I doing? Am I getting awards attention just for keeping my lines straight on short notice?’ The first one, the Golden Globe nomination, I’m pretty sure that came out while we were still shooting! I’m exaggerating, but it was insane, everything happened over a course of weeks. It felt like doing theatre.”And where his newfound viral fame is concerned, he is not entirely unaware. “I have heard about these, I always chuckle. The latest one was Roseanne! Why not bring me in to play Roseanne for the next season, I couldn’t believe this. I think it’s hilarious!”2018 marks six decades since Plummer made his big-screen debut in the little-seen drama Stage Struck, and his relationship to his own career continues to change. Among the ranks of nobles and professors, there’s one bugaboo from his filmography in particular that continues to haunt him, and finally accepting it reoriented his entire understanding of success.“It’s extraordinary, what people want to talk about during a chance meeting,” Plummer says. “The movies I like best, no one seems to care about, that’s always the way. I suppose The Sound of Music is the most popular role I’ve ever done, I really can’t avoid it.”For untold years, fans would warble a few bars of a Von Trapp family standard at Plummer every time he stepped foot outside his front door – enough to try any mortal’s patience. But Plummer confides that time has a way of rendering the cynical soft, and the soft cynical he counts himself among the former camp.To punctuate the reminiscence, he uncorks another one of his room-filling laughs. Maybe people are just inclined to hear such things when in an august presence, but this writer swears there are wistful notes under the joviality.

The midfielder announced his decision on Tuesday evening after claiming his “playing time would be significantly reduced” under the club’s new manager, Unai Emery.Wilshere made 197 appearances for Arsenal, 38 of which came last season – his best total since 2013-14 – and said it was always his intention throughout the recent contractual discussions to remain an Arsenal player.“Such was my desire to stay that I had in fact recently agreed to sign a financially reduced contract in order to commit my future to the club, said Wilshere in a statement on social media. “However, following my meeting with the new manager I was made aware that, although the reduced contract offer remained, it was made clear to me that my playing time would be significantly reduced should I decide to stay.“I am sure everyone can understand that at this point in my life and career I need to be playing regular first team football and following my meeting with Mr Emery I came away feeling that it would be very difficult for me to do so at Arsenal. Given this, I feel I have no option but to pursue other opportunities in order to progress my career on the pitch.”Wilshere was left out of England’s World Cup squad by Gareth Southgate in May and failed to make the stand-by list. Everton, West Ham and Juventus have been linked in the past with signing the central midfielder but Wilshere declined to say where he sees his future next season.Wilshere became Arsenal’s youngest-ever player when he made his debut aged 16 and 256 days in a Premier League win over Blackburn Rovers in 2008 and spent 17 of his 26 years at the London club. He was named PFA Young Player of the Year in 2010-11 and also earned a place in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year that season.Wilshere singled out Arsène Wenger for special praise and thanked “everyone at the academy for helping me to fulfil my dream and of course the fans, who I have always shared such a special relationship with.”Arsenal also released a statement: “Everyone at Arsenal would like to wish Jack Wilshere a successful future following his decision to seek new opportunities. Since joining our Academy more than 17 years ago aged just nine Jack has been a tremendous player for the club and a much-loved member of the Arsenal family. Thank you Jack for your contribution and the fantastic memories.

Ronaldo did what Ronaldo does. He got into dangerous areas, he scored and he was decisive.It did not matter that this was not a vintage Portugal performance. They got the job done and they have put one foot in the second round. Ronaldo’s goal came early and, after his hat-trick in the 3-3 draw with Spain, he is making the running for the Golden Boot.Imagine if he were to win that to place alongside his Ballons d’Or. Ronaldo is a current European champion at club and international level. Imagine if he were to crown the lot by winning the World Cup.What Morocco would have given for some of Ronaldo’s cutting edge. They had none and that is why their World Cup is over, which is a shame because there is much to like about Hervé Renard’s team. Driven by Hakim Ziyach and Noureddine Amrabat, the wide midfielders, they made the running and wove plenty of pretty patterns. But when the chances came in the second half, they blew each one.Ronaldo is all about end product. Morocco are not.Ronaldo’s bravery has never been open to question and the goal came when he plunged into a header as the boot of Karim El Ahmadi wafted about his ears. Once he had the position, the outcome was not in doubt.Portugal had worked a short corner routine, allowing João Moutinho to whip in the outswinger, and Ronaldo’s connection was true, unlike Morocco’s marking. It was unusual for Renard’s team to be so loose but costly. The ball fizzed past Munir El Kajoui Mohamedi and Morocco’s grip on their World Cup status looked more fragile than ever.Everybody connected to the north African nation had said the same thing before the tournament – the opening game was crucial. Everything depended on it but, against Iran, they had found a way to lose. That way was a 95th minute own goal from Aziz Bouhaddouz.They were in the last-chance saloon but they were determined to play their high-tempo passing game, heavy on movement and pace in wide areas. They looked slick and they got in behind the Portugal defence, through Ziyach and Amrabat. But the question nagged: did they have the end product?Amrabat shouted loudly for a penalty in the 26th minute, having wriggled past Raphaël Guerreiro and made it into the area. They were both at grabbing each other, before Amrabat went down, but neither the referee, Mark Geiger, nor his VAR team were moved to act. Guerreiro could be seen to inspect a set of deep scratch marks across his side after the incident.Renard wanted to know why VAR did not intervene while he and his players also complained when José Fonte cleaned out Khalid Boutaïb in the box shortly afterwards. Again, there was no censure.Mehdi Benatia could not react at the far post to convert a flick-on in first-half stoppage time but Portugal had the clearer chances before the interval. Following a surging run by Guerreiro, Ronaldo dragged narrowly wide of the far post while Ronaldo played in Gonçalo Guedes and he was denied by Munir.There was needle between Benatia and Ronaldo, which first sparked when the Juventus defender went through the back of him on 26 minutes, treading on his foot in the process. Benatia would be booked for a tackle from behind on him later in the first-half.Morocco continued to push in the second half and Santos, the Portugal manager, changed his shape to 4-3-3 or 4-5-1 when his team did not have the ball. It was a slender lead but it would do.Morocco had their chances and only a wonderful save by Rui Patricio, the new Wolverhampton Wanderers signing, kept out Younés Belhanda’s flick header. Patricio got across to deflect up and over the crossbar. Twice, Benatia made smart moves inside the area only to blaze his shot wildly while Ziyach cut inside and saw Pepe deflect his effort over the crossbar.It was not all perfect from Ronaldo on an inidual level. He blasted two free-kicks from the edge of the area into the wall while he skied horribly when he ran onto an inviting chance. There was also the moment towards the end when he initiated contact inside the area and went down. He was lucky not to be booked. But, yet again, Ronaldo had found a way to win."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8ece92dbbe559859cbfe6e14f2f9c0076f24cc/362_183_3163_1898/master/3163.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6904e1e1bfc0eb9f22a016cb78be5e8","title":"senegal playing for africa poland group h","story":"Aliou Cissé hailed a win for the ‘whole of Africa’ after his side defeated Poland to end the continent’s dismal start in RussiaSenegal had to wait and it was a painful one. Drawn to play in the final tie of the first round of group fixtures, they watched as, one by one, their fellow African competitors slumped to defeat. First it was Egypt and Morocco then Nigeria and Tunisia – all beaten and with only one goal to show between them. Even that was a penalty, scored by Tunisia’s Ferjani Sassi against England.Before Senegal’s bow against Poland at the Spartak Stadium on Tuesday, the manager, Aliou Cissé, said that Africa’s toils were not on his mind they did not add up to additional pressure or motivation. It was a white lie. Senegal had felt it, all right. They knew they were playing for African pride.The truth came out after the 2-1 win over Poland, a success built on steely mentality as much as anything else. “We saw the other African teams lose their first games and it gave us power to play for Africa,” the striker Diafra Sakho, who was an unused substitute, said. “Now, all of Africa is happy.”Even Cissé did not downplay the significance of a win for Africa. “Absolutely, it was important,” he said. “Senegal represent the whole African continent. We are Senegal but I can guarantee that the whole of Africa is supporting Senegal. I get calls and lots of people are proud. We are proud to represent the African continent.”The notion of such a support network across say, Europe, is hard to imagine. But sporting togetherness in Africa is a powerful force. “It’s true and it’s important,” Sakho, the Rennes player, formerly of West Ham, said. “We need to be together if the African continent is going to win a World Cup. It’s a very important job for us to keep it this way, to play together. That way, we’re going to make a lot of victories.”Pelé’s prediction, made in the late 1970s, that an African nation would win the World Cup by 2000 has not aged well. Cissé was a midfielder in the Senegal team that reached the quarter-finals in 2002 but no African country has made it further. Cameroon (1990) and Ghana (2010) are Africa’s other nations who reached the last eight.“It’s time now to give us all in Africa one opportunity to win a World Cup,” Sakho said, bullishly, and Senegal are surely the continent’s best hope of progress this time, even if them winning it remains an outlandish prospect.The victory over Poland was sparked by a lucky break, when Idrissa Gana Gueye’s shot, which was going wide, ricocheted in off the Poland defender Thiago Cionek.There was a measure of controversy to their second. M’Baye Niang had been off the field for treatment and, when he returned, he raced straight on to Grzegorz Krychowiak’s woeful backpass to touch past the advancing goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, and score. Cissé had been readying the substitute Cheikh Ndoye at the same time and Poland did not expect to see Niang.Sahko made the most persuasive point. “The referee gave Niang permission to come into the game and, if the referee gives his permission, it counts, this goal.”Senegal mustered only two shots on target, with the own goal not counting, and they did catch the breaks. But, equally, it was a tactical triumph for Cissé because his team never looked in trouble and they possessed speed and threat on the counterattack. Ismaïla Sarr on the right of the midfield three and Youssouf Sabaly at left-back have pace to burn. Senegal pressed high and they cut off the service to the Poland dangerman, Robert Lewandowski.Earlier on Tuesday, Japan had surprisingly beaten Colombia and there is the sense that Group H has been turned on its head. “Maybe for you it’s unexpected but we are happy,” Kalidou Koulibaly, the Senegal and Napoli centre-half, said. “It’s a difficult job but we know we can do it.”Senegal’s confidence has been pepped but, ahead of Sunday’s tie against Japan in Ekaterinburg, the watchword remains humility. “We are not too euphoric because we know it will be a difficult match against Japan,” Cissé said. “We need to question everything and prepare for the Japan match in the same way.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b41ca6e5302e773b0effc262c4abbe290a5a6d0/0_0_3198_1919/master/3198.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=124900f5014491d0a608dda92fd4419e 1240w","title":"portugal v morocco world cup 2018 live","story":"And Cristiano will no doubt be delighted that he is leading this race:Portugal survive! Morocco were the better team for most of the match and created an array of chances but they couldn’t find a telling touch when it mattered most. And that’s what Ronaldo specialises in. His early goal was the difference between the two teams. Morocco are eliminated from the World Cup despite a gallant display. They will be very, very frustrated. For years it was Portugal who had loads of brilliant players but not a top goalscorer. Maybe there’ll be a Moroccan Cristiano Ronaldo along in years to come. But for now, they’re going home (after playing Spain in their last game).90+ 4 min: Morocco win the ball back and hurry forward, desperate to create one more chance ....90+4 min: Corner to Portugal. Morocco may not see the ball again ...90+3 min: Morocco chuck a freekick into the mixer. It breaks to Benatia, who slams a left-foot shot ... over the bar from 10 yards! Another chance spurned.90 min: There will be at least five more minutes. Can Morocco break through at last?90 min: Benatia taps Pepe on the back of the shoulder. Pep goes down like he’s been hit by a sledgehammer. The man has no dignity. But he’s winning.89 min: Amrabat slips in Ziyach, who cuts in from the right, darts past two and unloads from 10 yards. Pepe flings himself in front of it and deflects it over the bar, then celebrates like he’s scored. He certainly saved his team. Morocco denied again!85 min: Ronaldo sends a rocket into the wall. Then he chases after it to try to get to the rebound. He succeeds ... and then is clipped by Amrabat. He falls to the ground and then gets up and makes the TV screen gesture. But not all contact is a foul. And that should be a booking for Ronaldo. 84 min: Suddenly Portugal mount an attack. Benatia brings down Ronaldo inches outside the box, right in the D. Danger here ...81 min: A Moroccan corner is cleared. Dirar runs on to the ball 30 yards out and senses his moment has come! He’s wrong. His shot veers towards Siberia. Meanwhile, a replay of the chaos in the Portuguese box a moment ago reveals that there was no foul, just lots of panicked players trying to get a telling touch on a ball that was pinging around. 80 min: Ziyach with a corner from the left. His outswinger sparks mayhem in the box. A Moroccan goes to ground and there are loud calls for a penalty! But the ref waves play on. I’ve no idea what happened but will let you know if a replay sheds any light. Portugal are clinging on here!79 min: Ziyach flights in a dangerous freekick from the right. Benatia meets it six yards out ... but with his shoulder rather than his head, and the ball bounces wide. This must be agonising for Morocco fans!76 min: Amrabat is now operating from the left. That’s almost unbelievable given how much he was making Guerreiro suffer. Ziyach is deployed on the right now and, in fairness, he should be able to hurt Guerreiro, too. 73 min: Morocco continue to apply pressure. You wouldn’t rule them out winning this, let alone equalising. If only precision didn’t desert them in the box. They’re both beautiful and exasperating to watch. It’s slightly bizarre that they could exit this tournament without scoring a goal. Apart from for Iran, that is.71 min: Martins hassled into losing the ball just outside his own box. Ziyach tries to thread it through to Kaabi but, as too often today, the most important pass goes awry.Morocco substitution: El Kaabi on, Boutaib off. That’s one centre-forward for another. At some point Renard may fancy sticking two up top.67 min: Freekick to Morocco after Guerreiro fouls Boussoufa, for a change. It’s a couple of yards outside the area, mid-way between the D and the corner. Ziyach steps up ... and curls over the bar. Never looked like it was going in.65 min: Guerreiro booked for pulling down Amrabat. Don’t rule out a red card for the full-back: he has no idea how to handle the winger, who’s been tormenting him all game.64 min: Morocco are dominant. They’re forcing Portugal to defend in numbers and increasingly deep. And they appeal for a penalty again when a cross from the right hits the arm of a defender. But the defender was too close to the attacker to be able to get out of the way so it could not be construed as deliberate.62 min: Morocco attack again. Their build-up play is splendid but their finishing is infuriating. But there’s still time ... “The ref got in the way of a Moroccan pass a few minutes ago,” observes Peter Oh. “I suppose it’s good to see an American get a touch of the ball in this tournament.” Badoom-tish.60 min: Another Moroccan freekick is sent into the box. The ball breaks to Benatia, 15 yards. He sidesteps a defender neatly ... but then snatches at his shot, whacking over the bar! 57 min: Ziyach sends over a vicious in-swinging freekick from the right. Belhanda rises and gets a splendid downward header to it from 10 yards. Patricio es to his right and tips it up and over the bar. That’s a brilliant save, not a million miles away from Banks’ from Pele in 1970! 55 min: Amrabat makes progress down the right again. Then he feeds Belhanda, who shuffles at the corner of the box and bangs off a testing shot. Patricio is equal to it. 54 min: Portugal have raised their game a little since half-time. They’re still not fluent, or even on top, but are at least they’re ensuring more of the play takes place in the Moroccan half.51 min: Portugal catch out Morocco with a quick free near half-way. The Moroccasn were arguing with the ref! Joao Mario then pulls the bak from the byline to Silva, who miscues from 15 yards. The ball rolls out Ronaldo, charging into the box like a train ... but his shot is wild, flying high and wide. Cue jeers from the Moroccan fans.49 min: Ronaldo robbed by Boussoufa as he surveyed his passing options inside the Moroccan half. 47 min: Portugal re-enact the short-corner routine that led to their goal. Fonte gets his head to it again but this time he’s under pressure and can’t direct it on to the target.46 min: We’re back. No changes during the break. But Renard did spent a minute or two talking to the officials in the tunnel, seemingly trying to convince the American referee to take a closer look at some of the challenges: Portugal seemed to get the benefit of most of the 5050 decisions in the first half.“Is this the best performance by a losing team that we’ve seen so far?” asks Charles Antaki. “Or should I say by a team that must inevitably concede again and go on to lose by another Cristiano teeth-grittingly too-easy goal?” Gah, enough of your fatalism, Charles. I’m saying Morocco get the equaliser they’ve been threatening. OK, possibly before conceding again to antother Cristiano teeth-grittingly too-easy goal.Ronaldo took advantage of shoddy Moroccan defending to send his country into an early lead. But since then Morocco have been well on top: they’re strong, vibrant and technically excellent. But they just can’t find a killer touch in front of goal. It was a similar story against Iran (without conceding an early goal). It must be painfully frustrating for Moroccan fans watching their team do so much so well but failing with the most important bit. But there is still time for them to get it right ...45 min: Ziyech stands over a freekick near the corner flag on the right. It’s a beautiful delivery. Belhanda get a glancing header on it. It’s not going in, but Benatia may be able to get a foot to it at the back post. No! It drops just beyond the Moroccan and continues out of play, much to Portugal’s relief. 42 min: Morocco infiltrate down the right again. Amrabat has Guerreiro on a rack. The Watford man cross low from the byline. Portugal scramble it away. It’s been a recurring them, Morocco getting behind the Portuguese defence - especially down the left - but unable to find a man in the box.39 min: The ball comes to Ronaldo about five yards outside the Moroccan box. He takes it on his chest and then lifts it over the defence into the path of Guedes. He’s clean through! The striker tries to guide a shot over El Kajoui but the goalkeeper stands tall and bats the ball away with one hand. Guedes should have left him with no chance there. 38 min: Ziyech flies down the left and looks up to see who’s in the box in anticipation of a cross. The answer is no one. Boutaib eventually arrives but it’s too few, too late. 36 min: Belhanda slips as he tries to tackle Guerreiro. Freekick to Portugal. Curiously, that was in exactly the same spot - out near the touchline - where Amrabat slipped earlier. Is there a patch of wet grass there? An oil slick?34 min: After dextrous approach play by Morocco, Ahmadi ties to rifle a shot into the net from nearly 30 yards. Instead he offers a souvenir to someone in Row Z.32 min: Ronaldo takes several deep breaths, caresses his thighs and adjusts his shorts .... then curs his freekick into the wall. Moroccan fans jeer with delight and relief.

Guests including George and Amal Clooney, Serena Williams, and Meghan’s best friend, Jessica Mulroney, and her husband, Ben, were served up “posh burgers” and pork belly with candy floss for dessert.Smyth is the first British woman to win 50 Best’s Elit Vodka world’s best female chef award.“I spent 15 years of my life in three-Michelin-starred restaurants and I trained to be the best I could be,” she said at the time. “It didn’t just happen, it wasn’t magic, I put in the work. “I stood shoulder to shoulder with men in the toughest kitchens in the world and excelled and loved it.”Smyth was awarded an MBE in 2013 for services to the hospitality industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/120a66641616869e7acaba94dcc789a727545413/0_594_4434_2660/master/4434.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85a40ce2b947817efad5186c6b3fd913","title":"us lobbyist for russian oligarch visited julian assange nine times last year","story":"It is unclear whether Adam Waldman’s 2017 visits had connection to Oleg DeripaskaA longtime US lobbyist for the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska visited Julian Assange nine times at the Ecuadorian embassy in London last year, according to visitor logs seen by the .Adam Waldman, who has worked as a Washington lobbyist for the metals tycoon since 2009, had more meetings with Assange in 2017 than almost anyone else, the records show.It is not clear why Waldman went to the WikiLeaks founder or whether the meetings had any connection to the Russian billionaire, who is now subject to US sanctions. But the disclosure is likely to raise further questions about the extent and nature of Assange’s alleged ties to Russia.US intelligence agencies concluded with “high confidence” last year, in an unclassified intelligence assessment, that the Kremlin shared hacked emails with WikiLeaks that undermined Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign as part of its effort to sway the 2016 election in favour of Donald Trump.Waldman is a lawyer and consultant in Washington and Deripaska’s primary lobbyist. He also represents other clients including Hollywood stars. Last year Deripaska paid Waldman about $562,000. According to filings to the Department of Justice (DoJ) by Waldman’s firm, the Endeavor Group, his work for Deripaska focused on advising the oligarch’s company UC Rusal on legal issues.When Deripaska first hired him, in 2009, Waldman’s firm was on a $40,000-per-month retainer. The Russian magnate was having problems obtaining a visa because of alleged connections to organised crime, which Deripaska denies. Waldman lobbied the US government to get Deripaska a visa.Waldman also served as a counsel for Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. A 2010 DoJ filing showed that the Endeavor Group was hired by Lavrov to help ease the “persistent state of limbo” that Deripaska faced as a result of his being refused entry into the US. In a letter to Waldman, Lavrov hailed Deripaska as one of Russia’s “prominent business leaders”.Waldman declined to answer questions from the  about his meetings with Assange or whether they were connected to the Russian billionaire.Waldman has not registered himself as a lobbyist for the WikiLeaks founder.A report last year by Fox News, which obtained leaked text messages between Waldman and the US senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee, suggested Waldman tried to broker a deal between Assange and the DoJ and that the negotiations were fruitless. It is not clear whether Waldman was brokering the deal on Assange’s behalf or someone else’s. The logs, obtained by the  and Focus Ecuador, reveal details of Assange’s life inside the Ecuadorian embassy, where he has been staying since June 2012. Waldman allegedly visited Assange twice on 12 and 13 January 2017, days before Trump’s inauguration as president, and again immediately after the ceremony, on 27 January. has separately corroborated that Waldman was in London in late March, when he saw Assange twice more. He visited the embassy three times in April and made two more visits at the end of November 2017. Deripaska is a key person in the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller into alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow.In summer 2016, when he was Trump’s campaign chief, Manafort offered Deripaska a confidential briefing, emails turned over to Congress and Mueller show. The briefing never happened, Manafort says. Deripaska was filmed soon afterwards on his luxury yacht discussing the forthcoming US election with Russia’s deputy prime minister, Sergei Prikhodko.Deripaska was subjected to more US sanctions in April. They were imposed on close associates of Putin’s in retaliation for alleged Kremlin meddling in the US vote. Meanwhile, Manafort faces multiple charges of money laundering arising from his work in Ukraine, and accusations of tampering with potential witnesses. He denies all charges. His bail was revoked last week and he is now awaiting trial in prison.Waldman’s relationship with Deripaska goes beyond consultancy. According to filings, in 2008 he travelled to Moscow, Amsterdam and Siberia with the oligarch for the purpose of “friendship”. In 2015 Waldman and his German second wife, Barbara Sturm, posed for photos with Deripaska at Munich’s Oktoberfest. Sturm, a dermatologist and beauty expert, has a major business presence in Russia.In April Waldman placed an article by Deripaska with the conservative Daily Caller news website, sources say. The oligarch called allegations of collusion “invented” and said he and the Russian government were victims of a “deep state” Washington plot. Waldman has cultivated connections with senior Democratic politicians and spent summers with many of them in Martha’s Vineyard. According to filings, Deripaska has paid Waldman via a series of offshore firms, with cash routed via shell companies in the British Virgin Islands, Belize and Jersey. At least one of Deripaska’s companies, Sea Chaika Corporation, appears in the Panama Papers. In 2010 it transferred at least $85,000 to Waldman’s accounts. Sea Chaika is connected to anonymous firms registered in Cyprus. Deripaska and UC Rusal did not comment. Assange has denied the hacked Democratic party emails released by WikiLeaks in 2016 came from Moscow.Last month Lenín Moreno, the president of Ecuador, said Assange could continue to live in the embassy as long as he complied with the conditions of his stay and avoided voicing political opinions on Twitter. In March, Moreno restricted Assange’s visitors, cut his internet access and shelved a $5m (£3.7m) secret spy operation to protect him, called “Operation Hotel”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0933e8d09ad2b83118bcf09a4a02613d4f50333e/0_0_2250_1350/master/2250.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed67f71d0c4855b579aa6d6c119ab2be","title":"best albums of 2018 so far","story":"Lily Allen dished on her orce, Arctic Monkeys found their inner crooners, Cardi B earned her stripes, Pusha T teamed up with Kanye West and the Vaccines made an unexpected classicAs amusingly unfiltered as ever, Allen embraces the sunny disposition of Afro bashment and British rap, and pairs it with delicate, bruised and often dolorous songs about her orce – an affecting combination.What we said: “As Allen would doubtless point out, she never claimed to be perfect.

She has a quiver in her voice.She says her constituents were under no illusions about her concerns about a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal when they re-elected her.Sandbach says she often accused of wanting to tie the government’s hands. “Nothing can be further from the truth.”She says that the amendment concerns steps that would be taken when negotiations have broken down. She says she strongly believes negotiations will succeed.Not to have a process in place should negotiations collapse would be irresponsible. And what is more, this amendment will ensure that when the PM sits down to negotiate, she does so with the full backing of parliament. Far from binding the prime minister, it strengthens her hand.Sandbach says the amendment “delivers on a commitment to take back control.”Theresa May has just arrived in the Commons. Reporters who are in the chamber says she is looking happy and relaxed. At the vote last week, she was hastily summoning rebels to her private Commons office to offer a compromise.Here’s the snap reaction to Dominic Grieve’s concession from MPs and the commentariat.This is the withering verdict from Labour MP Caroline Flint. Grieve is moving his amendment anyway to allow MPs to express their view, though he will not support it.The Spectator’s James Forsyth says the deal means the day is delayed (yet again) when May will have to face down one wing of her party.That’s a view shared by the BBC’s Laura KuenssbergWho has won? The general consensus is that the government has given not much away, but Grieve has got enough to save some face. Here’s the Sun’s Tom Newton-Dunn.The ’s Gordon Rayner points out that the decision on the final motion will now be in the hands of the Speaker. Bercow has apparently told friends one of the reasons he wants to extend his time as Speaker is to see through Brexit.Labour MP Angela Eagle says his power is still constrained. Grieve is now talking about the Davis compromise statement (see 1.53pm), which he says will be tabled as written ministerial statement tomorrow.He says this confirms that it will be up to the speaker to decide whether a motion can be amended.And he reads out the final paragraph, saying “as is the convention”, the Commons can hold debates and votes.Labour’s Chris Bryant intervenes. He says in recent years the government has often ignored Commons votes. The only thing with legislative effect is legislation. That is why there must be a meaningful vote.Grieve says the government could ignore an amendment as voted on under the Lords amendment. That could be be enforced in law, he says. It would have to be enforced by the Commons itself - by a confidence motion or other means.He says he has considered what the PM has told him about her anxieties. His own judgement is that he should “accept the government’s difficulty and support it”, he says.Grieve says, if MPs want a vote on his amendment, he will allow one. But he will not be voting for it any more, he says.He ends with a final point. He says there is enough “madness” around to make him wonder whether “collective sanity” has been destroyed.And bullying is making it worse, he says. He says people are afraid of backing down in case someone says they have lost.(I’ve got to finish now. I’m handing over to my colleague Jessica Elgot.)Dominic Grieve, the Conservative former attorney general, is speaking now.Grieve talks through the history of the various “meaningful vote” proposals. (There is a quick guide here.) He says he thought the original Lords amendment (Hailsham 1, you could call it) included a mandatory element, involving parliament giving directions to the government. That was unprecedented since the civil war, he says.He says he negotiated an alternative last week. That fell through. He says he makes no criticism of anyone in relation to that. Sometimes negotiations fall through.The alternative was tabled in the Lords.Two concerns were raised, he says.First, whether the matter would be justiciable (ie, whether someone could take the government to court for ignoring what the Act said).Second, there was an argument that having this in legislation could make it harder for the government to get a good deal.He says he found it hard to ignore this argument, even though, as is well know, he thinks Brexit is a big mistake.Starmer says the Lords amendment would ensure that, if the Commons voted down the withdrawal agreement, there would be order, not chaos.He urges MPs to vote for it.Labour’s Ruth Smeeth asks Starmer to confirm that it is Labour’s policy that the UK will leave the EU in March next year.Starmer says that is Labour’s position.Starmer says the government originally said MPs should not vote on the deal. They said that would tie the hands of the government. But eventually the government agreed to one, and the sky did not fall in.This is not frustrating the Brexit process, he says. He says this is about ensuring there is a process.Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, is speaking now.He says the Lords amendment is not about blocking Brexit, or tying the hands of the government.It is just about making sure that on the most important peacetime issue this country has considered, parliament has a voice.He says Theresa May’s view is that, if parliament votes down the deal, “tough luck”. That does not amount to a meaningful vote.The government is saying if, parliament votes down the deal, a minister will make a statement. “Well, I should think so.”He says the government is saying there must be a vote on a motion in neutral terms.He says there is an example of a motion in neutral terms on the order paper today. There will be a debate on Nato. And the motion says: “That this House has considered Nato.”Labour’s Paul Farrelly raises a point of order. Referring to the Davis statement (see 1.53pm), he asks John Bercow what discretion he would have to rule that a motion could be amended if it were couched in neutral terms.Bercow says he thinks this will be addressed in the debate.Davis says you cannot enter a negotiation without the right to walk away.So the Lords amendment would undermine the UK’s position in the negotiation, he says.He says this is the paradox:In trying to head off no deal, you actually make no deal more likely.He says this would give the EU an incentive to delay.He says the EU has already shown inflexibility, in issues like Galileo, and again yesterday on security.We cannot allow such an approach to become commonplace across all negotiations.Sylvia Hermon, the independent MP for North Down, says she could not accept a no deal Brexit. That would lead to a hard border returning in Ireland.Davis says the government will not accept the return of a hard border.Ken Clarke, the Conservative pro-European, says the Lords amendment (“Grieve 2”), would oblige the government to table a substantive motion. He says the government rejected that. He says, if anyone did try to propose a substantive amendment in those circumstances, the government would say that what was being proposed was unacceptable.Davis says he does not want to follow Clarke down the path of considering hypotheticals.Davis is now talking about the “meaningful vote” amendment.He says the government had three tests for such an amendment: it should not undermine the negotiations, it should not change the constitutional relationship between parliament and the executive, and it should accept the results of the referendum.He sums up what the government is now offering.If parliament rejects the deal, the government must make a statement and table a motion. If there is no deal, there must be a statement and a motion. And if by January no agreement has been passed by parliament, a motion will be brought to parliament.Labour’s Hilary Benn asks why the government amendment says this motion must be “in neutral terms”. Under Commons standing order 24 (b), a motion that the speaker rules to be in neutral terms cannot be amended.Davis says he will address this. He reads out standing order 24 (b).David Davis, the Brexit secretary, is opening the debate.He says the government’s critics should not question its democratic credentials. He says parliament has been repeatedly involved in this process.Parliament has more say over Brexit than the European parliament, he says.John Bercow, the speaker, says he will call two amendments for a vote: Dominic Grieve’s one (see 11.24am) and one from the Lib Dem MP Tom Brake, saying the Commons “meaningful vote” could trigger another referendum on the final Brexit deal.By lunchtime the gap between what the government was offering and what the rebels, led by Dominic Grieve, wanted was narrow. They both accept that, if MPs have not approved the Brexit withdrawal agreement by 21 January 2019, the government must schedule a vote within five working days. (See 11.24am.) But the government was saying that motion must be “in neutral terms, to the effect that the House of Commons has considered the matter of”. A motion like that would not be amendable. But Grieve and the rebels were not happy, because, in those circumstances, they wanted MPs to be able to table an amendment saying something like: “This House now requires the government to return to Brussels to try againnegotiate EEA membershipor whatever.”The government has now issued a statement (see 1.53pm) saying that, actually, it will be up to the speaker at the time to decide if said motion debated under the terms of this clause can be amended.(It is worth reminding readers that John Bercow, the speaker, has reportedly told friends he wants to stay as speaker until next summer so he can allow such an amendment. And that is one reason why some Tory Brexiters want him out.)The statement also says that ministers and MPs can table their own motions, implying that the Commons could have a vote anyway. This is true up to a point. But the government decides the parliamentary timetable, and, while the opposition parties get certain days for debate - when the government allows - ordinary backbenchers cannot just schedule a debate. This line is not an offer at all - just a description of the status quo (which puts most levers in the hands of the executive.)So the final paragraph is probably pointless. But the penultimate paragraph (the one about the speaker having the discretion to allow an amendment) does sound like a concession of sorts.However, it begs another question if the government would be happy for this January 2019 motion to be amended, why doesn’t it just accept the Grieve amendment tabled today (see 11.24am) removing the reference to the motion being “in neutral terms, to the effect that the House of Commons has considered the matter of”?Overall, as concessions go, it seems a bit thin. It is not clear whether the speaker would actually have the discretion under Commons rules to allow the motion to be amended.But this does look like a concession, and it is probably the case that the government whips have concluded it is just enough to buy off some of the rebels.We will find out in a moment, when the debate begins.In the Commons Labour’s Ben Bradshaw has just asked a point of order about the Tories refusing to “nod through” sick MPs.John Bercow, the speaker, says nodding through has been a long-established practice. But it is not matter for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f492e502b5c58f62c033af7226aa721bce0b76d0/0_49_724_434/master/724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=feef104dafc85e84a26694a2b4448049","title":"plantwatch surge in hay fever rooted in our modern lifestyles","story":"This has been the worst month for hay fever for 12 years. Grasses had perfect growing conditions over late April and in May with warm sunshine and showers. That was followed in June by hot dry conditions when the grass flowers matured and shed clouds of pollen on light breezes and up people’s noses.The strange thing is that hay fever was incredibly rare when it was first reported by John Bostoc, a London doctor, nearly 200 years ago. Yet in those days far more people lived and worked in the countryside, where grasses grew everywhere. Today, hay fever has reached epidemic proportions and afflicts more than a fifth of the British population, even in towns where you might imagine grass pollen is less of a problem.This statistic has been blamed on modern lifestyles, including factors such as obsessive hygiene and excessive use of antibiotics.Above all, air pollution from traffic is a huge factor in the upsurge of hay fever. Exhaust fumes help weaken pollen grains, making them split open more easily and spew out the allergic substances that trigger the condition. And polluting gases, such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide, also make hay fever sufferers more sensitive to pollen allergens."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaa5808b019fc8d6d63cc5384b64da2d1d0a841b/0_111_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d63f6fb6375dcc060e892bd68db1da46","title":"boot fit female footballers marketing mens","story":"Pretty much every day someone pops up on my Twitter timeline to let me know about market forces. It’s not inequality that pushes women’s sport into the shadows, it’s economics. Don’t take it personally!This month the conversation about sport’s gender pay gap spiked with the publication of Forbes’ list of the world’s highest-paid athletes. There were no sportswomen on the list. While it’s interesting to know just how many Ferraris Neymar’s PSG contract could buy, or that it covers the wages of the top 1,693 female footballers in the world, the data paints only a partial picture of the gaping chasm of inequality in sport.Sports science, I would argue, is a more revealing place to start. The feminist campaigner Caroline Criado Perez is unequivocal about the lack of provision for women: “It’s more or less non-existent, making it basically impossible to offer evidence-based advice to female athletes.” Wow. That’s worrying. In research for her forthcoming book, The Other Half, she came across the absurd – and universal - practice of using male bodies as default in scientific studies.In sport we see a similar pattern. Serena Williams was told by a doctor to “get over it” when she complained of debilitating headaches during her period (she was later diagnosed with menstrual migraines). Jelena Jankovic was ridiculed in the media for talking about “women’s problems” affecting her performance at Wimbledon. Menstruation and its effects on sports performance is a relatively new area of research. It is also often cited as a reason why women are not used in sports science studies, because fluctuating hormone levels in the menstrual cycle make it a more challenging process. All the more reason, you would think, that we need to study it.A quick ring-round reveals that although some of the elite Women’s Super League players wear women’s fit boots, many don’t. I scratch my head. How can there be footballers playing in the best league in England not wearing female-fit boots?Does it matter – if the shoe fits? Well yeah, if it doesn’t truly fit. There are four main differences between men and women’s feet: a narrower heel cup (where the shoe grips the heel), a wider forefoot leading to women buying smaller shoes to fit the heel and then getting squashed in at the toe, higher arches and – further up the skeleton – wider hips leading women to pressure-load their feet differently. For a generation of players to be wearing boots that aren’t designed to take into account these differences is a nonsense. Particularly at a time when we are trying to grow women’s sport.No one is lobbying to buy a suite of sports cars, or mansions, for female footballers. But, surely, everyone deserves the best knowledge and insight that science can offer a sporting career. And a proper pair of boots.Anna Kessel is a sports writer and author of Eat Sweat Play: How Sport Can Change Our Lives"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/709ac8bccc41ba3792bf6d89ee7a891d8bd7e05b/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=491848014de84c44339a3cbfd03e6b41 720w","title":"royal ascot 2018 day two live","story":"Hydrangea is all class and will be sharper for her reappearance defeat but she could still be vulnerable, giving 5lb to potential improvers over a trip that is probably short of her best.

The filly is named after the main villain of the series. The colours of her owner, Vimal Khosla, have also been carried in recent years by Hyperdrive and Final Frontier, so I think we’re getting an idea of where his interests lie.And they’re off ...Nelson has the lead with a mile to go ... and now extends the lead to about five or six lengths ... Yabass is two or three lengths clear of the rest ... Nelson clear on the home turn ... Kew Gardens getting going and takes the lead ... and wins ... and no sooner have I said Aidan O’Brien is having a frustrating meeting he has the first three in the next race! Southern France is back in second and Nelson third.Signora Cabello narrowly prevailed in a blanket three-way finish to the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. A big-priced winner of a Listed race at York last time out, the powerful Phoenix Thoroughbred organisation bought a three-quarter share into the filly. Still in the care of John Quinn and ridden by Oisin Murphy, the daughter of Camacho was sent off at 25-1 on this occasion, and was never far from the pace. Aidan O’Brien’s Gossamer Wings and the Clive Cox-trained Shades Of Blue were late challengers, but it was the northern raider who prevailed by a short head and the same. Wesley Ward’s favourite Chelsea Cloisters never threatened at any stage under Frankie Dettori. Quinn said: “All she did, really, was improve. She was well on top at the line (at York) and since then she’s trained lovely. She’s very unassuming. She’s terribly, terribly tough. I’m really pleased.” PAMuch as I admire Aidan O’Brien, his Kew Gardens can’t be the right favourite for this, having been beaten at odds-on at Lingfield, followed by a well-beaten effort in the Derby, when he paid for helping to force a strong pace. Can that be the right preparation for this test, just 18 days later? Almoghared, a half-brother to Taghrooda, might be the best of these in time but his stablemate, Stream Of Stars, looks more of a ‘now’ horse and can make the necessary step up on his maiden win around here last month.The draw looked very fair there in the Queen Mary Stakes so there may not be any marked bias towards either side.

Still no winner for Aidan O’Brien, who is having a frustrating meeting so far, and was second with Gossamer Wings there.Just a quarter of an hour to go until the first race of day two at Royal Ascot, and the betting markets are beginning to bubble.Frankie Dettori’s mount Chelsea Cloisters remains a solid favourite for the opening Queen Mary Stakes at around 7-2, but his partner, Stream Of Stars, in the next, the Queen’s Vase, is quite weak in the market so far today and is out to 9-2 in the face of support for two Aidan O’Brien-trained runners, Kew Gardens and Nelson, who is in to 7-2 joint-favourite with his stable companion from 9-2 this morning.Hydrangea, the O’Brien-trained favourite for the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes at 3.40, is also weak in the betting and is out to 2-1 in a place while William Haggas’s Urban Fox is in to 7-1 from 10-1 thanks to each-way support.In the big betting race of the day, the Royal Hunt Cup at 5.00, Saltonstall has been backed into 9-1 from 12-1 with Hills to give Mick Halford his second success in the race in three years with a runner in Godolphin blue.Supporting Chelsea Cloisters here is a statement of faith in her trainer, Wesley Ward, rather than in the filly herself but faith in Ward would be entirely justified. He has had at least one winner at Royal Ascot in each of the last five years and this has been the most productive race for him, yielding three wins since 2009. Chelsea Cloisters appears to be the pick of his party and gets the sort of fast ground that gives zippy US raiders a big chance. Odds of 9-4 clearly cannot be described as generous in a big field of unexposed types but they are better than I expected just the same.The Duke of Cambridge Stakes is run today today, but no Duke of Cambridge in the royal procession.

However, smartbets report that the bookmakers have generally cut the odds on Her Majesty wearing a blue hat from 4-1 to 2-1. So what are the vital facts. Well, since 2005, the Queen has worn blue 13 times, followed by pink which has had 12 outings, white has been worn 11 times, green and purple seven times each, yellow worn five times in recent years, including yesterday, orange twice, and turquoise and brown once each. Here’s today’s betting: 2-1 Blue, 3-1 Pink, 5-1 White, 8-1 Green, 16-1 Orange, 20-1 Brown, 25-1 Red, 100-1 George Cross.Our own snapper, Tom Jenkins, has got the pic of live betting on the Queen’s Hat Stakes from the track. John Gosden 3 winsWillie Mullins 1Charlie Appleby 1Eve Johnson Houghton 1Thank God for Eve J H, for breaking her way into this gathering of Racing’s Most Powerful. The only really big name missing would be that of Aidan O’Brien, who had 12 runners yesterday and had just a second and a third to show for it. Rhododendron running unplaced must have been a sore one and evidently more was expected of U S Navy Flag, though he hasn’t seemed the same horse this year as last. Still, none of O’Brien’s Day One losers started favourite and it would probably be a mistake to read much into their defeats. He was also blanked on the first day last year but ended the week with six winners. Today’s nine runners include two likely favourites in Kew Gardens and Hydrangea. Gosden, meanwhile, could be on his way to his best ever Royal Ascot. Five winners is his current best, achieved in 2012.Frankie Dettori 3 winsAndrea Atzeni 1Charles Bishop 1William Buick 1And let’s not forget that Dettori only had three mounts on Day One. His first ride today is a favourite and his second ride is fancied, so it’s pretty easy to imagine him starting this Royal Ascot on a streak of five consecutive winners. But do you worry about his 47-year-old frame holding up under the strain of it all? Yesterday, he had a race off between each ride. Today, he’s in all six races and perhaps we won’t be getting the very best of him in the 5.35pm contest. Meanwhile, young Ryan Moore has yet to break his duck. Mind you, that was also true at the same stage last year and he ended the week as top jockey.Rides today:2.30 Dettori: Chelsea Cloisters 5-2  Moore: So Perfect 7-13.05 Dettori: Stream Of Stars 4-1  Moore: Kew Gardens 100-303.40 Dettori: Wilamina 8-1  Moore: Hydrangea 15-84.20 Dettori: Cracksman 4-6  Moore: Cliffs Of Moher 12-15.00 Dettori: Gabrial 25-1  Moore: Master Merion 20-1 5.35 Dettori: Purser 16-1  Moore: Could It Be Love 11-2Further to speculation earlier that Frankie Dettori might set a new Royal Ascot record by winning on four consecutive rides at the meeting if Chelsea Cloisters wins the first, the press room’s resident Fred Archer expert, Dave Yates of the Daily Mirror, has revealed that the great jockey once steered six mounts in a row to victory here back in the 19th century (as pointed out earlier). At the best odds currently available, Dettori is about 200-1 to match Archer’s remarkable record by winning the first three races here today, and about 320-1 to go one better. Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, was asked about Gosden’s comment in an interview with Rishi Persad on ITV’s Opening Show programme this morning and played it with a very straight bat. Stickels also reported that 4mm of watering on the course overnight in order to maintain the going at good-to-firm.“There was some evaporation yesterday, about 3mm, and obviously it was drying out through the afternoon. We hadn’t watered before that since early Sunday morning, so with a dry forecast we felt we needed to keep some moisture in the ground to keep it good-to-firm. “We watered with 4mm and we’ve now got a misty morning with a bit of dew on the track. It will feel like there is more moisture in the ground but this will burn off and it will be good-to-firm later.”2.30 Queen Mary Stakes Supporting Chelsea Cloisters here is a statement of faith in her trainer, Wesley Ward, rather than in the filly herself but faith in Ward would be entirely justified. He has had at least one winner at Royal Ascot in each of the last five years and this has been the most productive race for him, yielding three wins since 2009.

Odds of 9-4 clearly cannot be described as generous in a big field of unexposed types but they are better than I expected just the same. 3.05 Queen’s Vase Much as I admire Aidan O’Brien, his Kew Gardens can’t be the right favourite for this, having been beaten at odds-on at Lingfield, followed by a well-beaten effort in the Derby, when he paid for helping to force a strong pace. Can that be the right preparation for this test, just 18 days later? Almoghared, a half-brother to Taghrooda, might be the best of these in time but his stablemate, Stream Of Stars, looks more of a ‘now’ horse and can make the necessary step up on his maiden win around here last month.3.40 Duke Of Cambridge Stakes Hydrangea is all class and will be sharper for her reappearance defeat but she could still be vulnerable, giving 5lb to potential improvers over a trip that is probably short of her best. Urban Fox appeals at an each-way price, having shown career-best form on his first run for William Haggas, landing a handicap over this course and distance last month.4.20 Prince Of Wales’s Stakes A top-class opening day for John Gosden and Frankie Dettori will have the Newmarket pair relaxed and happy as they approach the main business of this Royal Ascot, which, for them, is getting Cracksman to win the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. On an unbeaten run of five, the colt is a fabulous talent who stands out like a beacon in race that otherwise seems short of star wattage. Admittedly, he made his backers sweat at Epsom three weeks ago but in the end he managed to score from an unpromising position, which is arguably another reason to admire him. The one source of doubt here is the ground, which will be easily the fastest he has encountered since his winning streak began. If he takes time to let himself down on it, there is a risk that one of the others might have pinched a few vital lengths in the meantime. Poet’s Word, who trailed Cracksman by seven lengths in October, could not really be called progressive and surely can’t win unless the favourite runs miles below expectations. Hawkbill has it in him to be dangerous but ran no race last time, which could be why the blinkers are now fitted. He’s the one to worry about and I might try him in a reverse exacta with the favourite.5.00 Royal Hunt Handicap The thing to worry about here is the draw. It hardly ever pays to be adamant about these things but yesterday’s Coventry Stakes and last month’s Victoria Cup suggested that those drawn low, towards the far side, have an advantage over the rest, though of course that advantaged can be wiped out, depending on where most jockeys decide to go when the stalls open. My fancy, at least, has a low draw in three. Mick Halford won this race two years ago with a Godolphin-owned four-year-old, carrying a penalty for a recent success at The Curragh, and could turn the trick again with Saltonstall. He was a pleasing winner of a competitive handicap last month on the driest surface he had yet encountered and a 5lb penalty leaves him leniently treated.5.35 Jersey Stakes Here is another prize waiting to be picked up by the Gosden  Dettori combination, represented by Purser. He idled in front when landing a Listed contest under Rab Havlin last time and ought to be well suited by this stiff seven furlongs.2.30 Queen Mary Stakes Chelsea Cloisters 5-23.05 Queen’s Vase Stakes Stream Of Stars 4-13.40 Duke of Cambridge Stakes Urban Fox (nb) 10-14.20 Prince of Wales’s Stakes Cracksman 4-65.00 Royal Hunt Cup (Handicap) Saltonstall (nap) 12-15.35 Sandringham Handicap Purser 16-1Given what happened yesterday, I’m feeling pretty good about the fact that Frankie Dettori is on four of my tips today. For those of you who missed it, Dettori managed to win on ALL THREE of his rides on day one, which is a heck of an achievement, even allowing for the fact that two of them were favourite. After all, there were four other favourites on yesterday’s card, ridden by jockeys other than Dettori, and none of them won. Anyway, I had a somewhat less rewarding Day One than our man from Italy, so it would be really terrific if he were able to do the business on Chelsea Cloisters, Stream Of Stars, Cracksman and Purser.The going at Ascot remains good to firm on Wednesday morning. They put down 4mm of artificial watering after racing on Tuesday, to counter the effects of evapotransporation during the day. GoingStick readings are almost identical to Tuesday morning, though the effect of the watering seems to have been marginally greater on the centre of the straight mile than on either side. What it all boils down to is that, as yesterday, fast horses have ideal conditions while ploddy grinders are right up against it. In the round-course races, it will be hard to make up many positions after the turn for home, unless the early pace has been mad.Congratulations to titusisashambles, who won Tuesday’s competition on a final score of +15.25, thanks to Lagostovegas (10-1), Blue Point (6-1) and Without Parole (9-4), leaving him well clear of anyone else who took part.

Newsboy of the Daily Mirror has dug up clippings of the Evening Standard to show that Fred Archer rode six consecutive winners at Royal Ascot in 1878. I don’t doubt that most  readers were already aware of this. Perhaps some of you had them in doubles and trebles. Anyway, what this means is that Frankie is not setting any records today unless he can ride the first four winners...Frankie Dettori had the effervescence knob turned up to 11 at Royal Ascot on Tuesday and he will be aiming to keep it there this afternoon when he has two certain favourites, a strong second-favourite and a live each-way chance among his full book of six rides. By this evening, he could have the prize for the week’s top jockey effectively wrapped up with three days to spare, but this being Ascot, this could also be the day when his streak peters out.If Chelsea Cloisters takes the opening Norfolk Stakes for Wesley Ward, Dettori will have scored on four consecutive rides at the Royal meeting since he did not have a mount in either the King’s Stand Stakes or the Ascot Stakes here on Tuesday. James Doyle managed three in a row back in 2013 – which were also his first three winners at the meeting – and it will require some digging in Ascot’s archives to be absolutely certain that four straight winners would be unprecedented. Since three or four winners over the whole meeting was often enough to win the riders’ championship in the past, however, my money would say that it would. Dettori also has a big chance aboard John Gosden’s Stream Of Stars in the Queen’s Vase and a fair squeak on Wilamina in the Duke Of Cambridge Stakes before attention turns to Cracksman’s attempt to win the day’s feature race, the Prince of Wales’s Stakes.Cracksman will be the shortest-priced favourite of the week but it could be argued – by me, at any rate - that he has a few questions to answer after his run in the Coronation Cup at Epsom last time. He did not look like the winner there at any stage bar the final half-furlong, and while it may just be – as both Gosden and Dettori have suggested – that he did not handle the track, he handled it well enough to finish third in the Derby last season.Cracksman did not appear to be travelling easily even in the early stages of the race, long before the downhill run to Tattenham Corner. He is an exceptional talent and he will hopefully put that lacklustre run behind him today, but at 8-13 it is not difficult to sit the race out from a betting perspective as the final field of seven does not lend itself to an each-way alternative. Later on the card, there is the chance of a winner for the course’s owner as the Queen’s Seniority, who had been the second reserve for the race after missing the initial cut-off point of 30 runners, managed to creep in at the bottom of the handicap after Mubtasim, a stable-mate at the William Haggas yard that had made the cut, was found to be suffering from lameness. Funny, that. Seniority is currently the 12-1 joint-favourite to become the first winner here in the Royal colours since Dartmouth in the Hardwicke Stakes two years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94d7f720c436897b5abc3ae0662506c863d6c637/0_111_4590_2754/master/4590.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f08605e6d443b6cd57142e415e843b6","title":"beirut review park theatre london","story":"Park theatre, London In Alan Bowne’s play, an allegory exploring New York’s 1980s Aids crisis, a couple meet in secretAn unnamed plague has hit New York. The virus is spread through sexual contact, the death toll is rising, there seems to be little hope of a cure and government response is both unclear and ineffective. American playwright Alan Bowne’s 1987 one-act play Beirut is a clear allegory for the New York Aids crisis Bowne himself died of Aids two years after its premiere.In Beirut’s world the virus runs rife, transmitted via the merest drop of bodily fluids – at least, that’s what the government thinks. Sexual contact has been banned, with fines handed out for dressing provocatively, and the death penalty is meted out to those who try to hide from their near-constant surveillance and have sex.Quarantined with others infected in New York’s Lower East Side (now known as “Beirut”), Torch hides out in his mess of a bedsit eating tinned food, with little more than a radio for company. Liz Ascroft’s set design shows great attention to detail, and the lighting provides the dingy feel the play needs. Over the course of 60 minutes we watch virus-positive Torch spar back and forth with virus-negative Blue, his pre-infection girlfriend, who has sneaked into Beirut. With both in varying but near-constant states of undress, the conversation boils down to whether or not they should risk sleeping together.While Louisa Connolly-Burnham and Robert Rees have passable chemistry as Blue and Torch, they come across as mismatched. Beyond the “sex or no sex” question, their motivations are incomprehensible. The accents, supposedly from Brooklyn and Queens, veer wildly, which highlights a dialogue that gets progressively more contrived. All talk of the outside world raises more questions than it answers, and the frequent segues into misogynistic violence feel superfluous at best.Robin Lefevre’s direction has the pair coming across as near frenzied – perhaps to show the extent of their lust – but leaves them kissing and flipping each other like a pair of overexcited puppies. What should be a punchy, claustrophobic exploration of one couple’s mounting sexual tension, instead comes across as rushed, confusing and distinctly unsexy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9e94112f517c27573f44826d127196fe8af5764/0_245_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6df4a53b03387237d14a2f90e27307f3","title":"parents urged to set boundaries around childrens use of the internet","story":"Culture secretary condemns unsupervised access to smartphones and urges more heads to ban them in schoolsThe culture secretary has said it is up to parents to set boundaries around their children’s use of the internet and has condemned unlimited and unsupervised access to smartphones.Matt Hancock, whose brief includes digital issues, agreed parenting in the digital era was difficult but he said it was not impossible and he urged parents to set boundaries around new technology in the same way they have always set boundaries for their children.His comments on parental responsibility followed his earlier call for more headteachers to ban mobile phones in schools.In a speech to an NSPCC conference on children’s online safety, he said: “It’s easy to see why some parents feel uncomfortable with the technology their children are using, especially when their children may know far more about it than they do. Parenting in this digital age is hard but it does not mean it’s impossible,” he told the audience. “Setting boundaries on the use of new technology is important just in the same way as we set boundaries for children in every sense. The technology may be new but the principles have not changed.”He warned: “Unlimited and unsupervised access to smartphones can be a portal to some very serious risks. And the chief medical officer has highlighted growing concerns around the impact on children’s mental health. This backs up every parent’s instinct that children must be protected.”Responding to his comments, an NSPCC spokesperson said: “Of course parents need to help their children navigate the online world, and to agree rules and boundaries as a family.“The problem is that at the moment parents can often struggle with those decisions as they are faced with no consistent child safety standards across social networks.”Hancock, who has three young children, told the  in a recent interview that he does not allow them mobile phones, saying: “They don’t have access to the devices. They don’t have phones. Why do they need phones? They’re children, they’re 11.”Elaborating during his speech at Wednesday’s conference, he added: “I firmly believe that very young children don’t need to have access to social media at all. After all, they are children.“Social media is not designed for under-13s. It is often against the terms and conditions for children to be using these platforms.” On mobile phones in schools, the culture secretary said: “Whilst it is up to inidual schools to decide rather than government, I admire the many headteachers who take a firm approach and do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day.”He also quoted a recent study in the Journal of the Association for Consumer Research which showed that mobile phones could have an impact on working memory and measured intelligence, even if the phone was on a table or in a bag.A spokesperson for the Department for Education said: “Headteachers already, of course, have the power to ban mobile phones in schools and we support their right to do so.The NSPCC said there needed to be more evidence that banning children from using mobile phones in schools altogether would help keep them safer. “What we do know is that children are being exposed to unacceptable risks online from bullying, grooming and harmful content.“We want to help children and adults identify risks so they can use the internet safely. That’s why the government must legislate to force social networks to improve child safety, and design safety in from the start, not as an optional extra.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a2561f5c37964dd323606a33b250bb62be9a69/0_498_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6458f37b48a6b9aeb1696dacfcb9e324","title":"italy coalition rift roma register matteo salvini","story":"Matteo Salvini shrugs off critics who say policy reminiscent of fascist pastMatteo Salvini vowed to turn “words into action” in his drive to root out and expel thousands of nomadic Roma from Italy as he shrugged off critics who said the far-right interior minister was adopting illegal policies reminiscent of the country’s fascist past.Salvini, who has seen a jump in his approval ratings in the little under three weeks he has been in office, has called for a new census of Roma and for all non-Italian Roma to be expelled from the country. He also praised on Twitter the demolition of an “illegal” house used by Roma in Turin - which had been ordered by a local council controlled by Salvini’s League party - even as he was condemned by rival politicians and a top Jewish leader.Salvini’s move against the Roma comes amid a hard line against migrants into Europe, which last week saw him to refuse to allow a ship carrying more than 600 people rescued from Mediterranean from docking in Italy, forcing it to ert to Spain.The developments in Italy have caused the first major rift between Salvini and his Five Star Movement coalition partner. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment M5S, called Salvini’s order for the creation of a new Roma registry “unconstitutional”. A similar census pitched by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was blocked by an Italian court.It was also lambasted by Noemi Di Segni, the president of Italy’s union of Jewish communities, who said the proposal recalled the fascist race laws of the late 1920s and 1930s. The former centre-left prime minister Paolo Gentiloni also tweeted his disgust, saying: “Yesterday the refugees, today the Roma, tomorrow guns for all.”At first, Salvini seemed prepared to back down from his new policy but in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon he promised to stand by his call for mass expulsions.“I don’t quit and we’re moving forward,” he said in a tweet. He also pointed to a 2012 proposal by politicians in Milan, which included a call for a census of the Roma community in the city. That register, according to an article in Corriere della Sera, was part of a project to help families and children overcome “discrimination and the denial of dignity” and opposing “irregularity and illegality”. Salvini said such proposals were deemed good when they came from the left, but racist when they were proposed by him. “Italians and their security comes first,” he wrote. The row is the first sign of a potentially serious split between Salvini and Di Maio, who has been overshadowed in the first weeks of government and appears eager to rein in the far-right leader. The two parties – Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s M5S – are both populist, but the League has tended to be much more outspoken about its xenophobic and racist attitudes towards migrants and non-Italians.Salvini’s intense focus on immigration and “foreigners” has collided with M5S’s priorities of economic fairness and labour policy. The Roma community has long been a target of Salvini, whose rise to prominence often involved press appearances at Roma camps, which he has frequently threatened to raze. Few minorities are treated with as much contempt in Italy as the Roma, who face prejudice and stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in the social consciousness. On Monday Salvini ordered the census and the removal of all non-Italian Roma – which he called an “answer to the Roma question” – and said he wanted to know “who, and how many” there were. “Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can’t expel them,” Salvini said on Telelombardia.Salvini is on record as having praised Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, and his new policy has sparked comparisons by the centre-left Democratic party to ethnic cleansing rules introduced in the late 1920s that also targeted the Roma.“The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by the law,” Carlo Stasolla, president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which supports Roma rights, told the Ansa news agency. “We also recall that Italian Roma have been present in our country for at least half a century and sometimes they are ‘more Italian’ than many of our fellow citizens.”Francesco Palermo, a former senator in Italy and human rights expert who has defended the rights of Roma, said it would be legally impossible to pursue the creation of an ethnic-specific census and expulsions as Salvini described, because the issue had already been taken up by Italian courts in the past, where it was rejected.But he said the bigger problem was that the reaction to Salvini was generally positive, and that his popularity was growing despite the extreme nature of his positions.“It is very simple and very scary. Except for intellectuals and certain journalists, most people would say there is nothing wrong with this, and that is the tricky point. Salvini knows this. It is a just a means to get political support,” Palermo said.He added that reactions would be different if Salvini was targeting other groups of people who face discrimination, but that racist views about the Roma are “innate” among many people in Italy.Salvini’s actions were also denounced by Roberto Speranza, a lawmaker for the leftwing Freedom and Equality group, who said he had reported the interior minister for inciting racial hatred. “Enough is enough,” Speranza said.About 4,000 Roma live in state-sanctioned ghettos in Rome, according to a 2013 report by Amnesty International. These out-of-city ghettoes consist of pre-fabricated containers or mobile homes in fenced-off areas, often without adequate sanitation or clean drinking water. Inhabitants are excluded from other social housing despite many having lived in Italy for generations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bb5156641f1d143e37880552a6a817f21232577/0_109_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b80b6b054d3db185933d0a4e63bdd80","title":"top catalan chef joan roca defends decision to host spanish king","story":"Roca dismisses suggestion he is taking sides in Catalan independence rowThe celebrated Catalan chef Joan Roca has dismissed suggestions that he is taking sides in the bitter battle over Catalonia’s independence by hiring out one of his venues for a prize-giving ceremony attended by King Felipe.Roca, whose three-Michelin starred restaurant, El Celler de Can Roca, has twice been named the best in the world, says he is being unfairly criticised for agreeing to host the Spanish monarch, who angered many Catalans by refusing to denounce the police violence that met last year’s illegal independence referendum.The Princess of Girona Foundation awards, which promote young people’s professional and personal development, were due to be given out at a ceremony held at Girona’s auditorium on 28 June.But after the city council said the venue was unavailable because of building works, the event was transferred to Roca’s Espai Mas Marroch, a 15th-century country house on the outskirts of Girona.News that one of Catalonia’s most lauded chefs was hosting the king did not go down well with some pro-independence campaigners.Lluc Salellas, a city councillor for the far-left Popular Unity Candidacy (Cup), published an open letter to Roca and his two brothers, urging them not to host the event.“Rethink allowing Felipe of Bourbon, who justified the violence against thousands of Catalans - including hundreds of people from Girona - into your house, the Mas Marroch, to preach his words in our region,” said the letter.Roca responded to his critics on Wednesday, telling them the decision had nothing to do with politics and had been taken only because the auditorium was not available.“We’re hurt,” he told the Catalan radio station RAC1. “What’s happening seems unfair to us. The only thing we want to say is that we do not have to do politics. We’re cooks. A restaurant is about hospitality. We do our job.”However, Salellas accused the Rocas of being disingenuous.“The Roca brothers have a standing and a public reach that means they can receive thanks and congratulations,” he told RAC1. “But it also means they can receive criticism from those who don’t agree with their decision. They’re taking sides: by accepting the king’s attendance, they’re making a decision. That’s legitimate and respectable and we’re not questioning it. But I don’t think it’s right to suggest this isn’t a political gesture.”Carles Puigdemont, who was sacked as Catalan president by the Spanish government for staging the referendum and unilaterally declaring independence last October, was born in Girona province. The deposed premier also served as mayor of Girona city.A spokesman for the city council said the auditorium and another venue were scheduled to undergo works at the time of the awards ceremony.But he said the mayor, Marta Madrenas, who is a member of Puigdemont’s Together for Catalonia party, opposed the foundation’s use of the auditorium in any case.“The mayor has suggested that the auditorium’s management should not host the foundation’s prizes in future years,” he said. “The reason is the speech the king gave on 3 October, for which Girona city council declared him persona non grata by a wide majority.”The local council in the nearby municipality of Caldes de Malavella said it would protest against the king’s visit by naming a square to commemorate the holding of the independence referendum.In a statement, it said: “The king is not welcome in Caldes de Malavella. The municipality has not forgotten the angry speech he made on 3 October, with its absolute silence over the victims of the brutal police repression that saw peaceful citizens in Catalonia beaten and attacked on 1 October.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3537430.1529497978!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"appalling pressure on leaving cert students facing three exams today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDozens of Leaving Cert students are sitting three exams in one day - or almost nine hours in the exam hall - due to a timetable clash.Dozens of Leaving Cert students are sitting three exams in one day - or almost nine hours in the exam hall - due to a timetable clash.Some of those affected started exams at 9.30am today and will not finish until about 8 pm.This is due to a clash in the afternoon between the new politics exam - which is being sat by almost 900 students - and design and communications graphics .The State Examinations Commission said students affected will be provided with a supervised break at about 5pm between exams so they do not have any opportunity to access the exam paper taken by other candidates earlier in the day.However, the move has been criticised by some teachers and parents who say it is unfair on students.Clive Byrne, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said: “Three exams in one day is appalling. It amounts to enormous stress on students. If exams are to remain in the traditional two-and-half week timeframe, we should look at holding them on Saturdays.”He added: “Alternatively. shorter exams should be examined. If a student has to sit three exams, they could be three one-and-a-half hour exams.“We now have exams in English and history which last three hours and 20 minutes. This doesn’t even happen at second-level.”The broader issue of students facing three exams in a single day is due to a growing number exam subjects being shoe-horned into the two-and-a-half week period set aside for the Leaving Cert.At present, some 35 subjects are on the curriculum. The addition of new exam subjects such as computer science, PE and Chinese over the coming years will put even more pressure on the system.In a statement, the commission says it will explore alternative solutions with education partners to address the issue of timetable congestion.In total, about 70 student face sitting three exams in a single day over the course of the exam timetable, according to the commission.Today, a total of 16 Leaving Cert students are due to sit their politics exam in a special evening sitting due to subject clashes.Some of these students –11 in total – will end up sitting three exams in a single day. The commission said it has selected exam dates with a view to minimising subject clashes to the greatest degree possible. “The timetable is framed to minimise subject clashes as much as possible but unfortunately some clashes will occur,” a spokesman said.“In these cases a balance must be found between protecting the integrity of the examination, which entails inter alia all candidates nationally sitting their examinations at the same time, and allowing the candidate to have access to a state examination within the prescribed examination period. “Appropriate arrangements are made, therefore, for the candidate to sit one of the subjects later on the evening of the day scheduled for that subject.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3537155.1529476874!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"patience with britain wearing out over border solution hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhil Hogan: ‘I have never seen such solidarity in the Commission on any issue, as I have seen in relation to the problems that this can create for Ireland.’ File photograph: David SleatorThe Patience with the British Government is “wearing out” in Brussels over delays proposing solutions for how to avoid a hard border in Ireland, European Commissioner for Agriculture Phil Hogan has said. The British Government do not have a “coherent position” on what kind of Brexit deal they want, which has posed problems for EU negotiators, Mr Hogan told journalists in Brussels on Tuesday. The comments come ahead of a key European Council summit of EU leaders next week. An initial deadline for the British government to make progress on how the Border “backstop” commitment would be achieved in time for the summit, is anticipated to be missed. The backstop was a commitment given last December, that if there was no deal reached on how to avoid a hard border, there would be no ergence in customs and trade rules between the Republic and Northern Ireland. Both Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney have said the backstop agreement would need to be “legally operable.”“If the United Kingdom continues the way they have been over the last number of months, without coming forward with proposals as promised, well then you’re facing the difficult situation of a no-deal,” Mr Hogan said. October is the deadline to agree an overall Brexit deal, as the European Parliament will need time to approve it. “We’re waiting for a long time for the United Kingdom to tell us precisely what they want out of these negotiations. . . They need to do so sooner rather than later, as time is getting short, and patience is wearing out,” Mr Hogan said.There was a “good understanding” of the political problems UK prime minister Theresa May faces within her party, in trying to agree what relationship Britain will have with the EU after they leave, he said. Mr Hogan said Ireland had achieved a “strong” position in the Brexit negotiations, aligning the other 26 Member States in making avoiding a hard border a necessity. “I have never seen such solidarity in the Commission on any issue, as I have seen in relation to the problems that this can create for Ireland,” he said. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy said his party would be “disappointed” if the Irish Government failed to secure progress on the Border backstop at the June summit. “In an 11th hour negotiation, pressure would come on the Irish Government to accept a political statement”, rather than a legal text, he said. A political commitment to avoid a hard border would hold “zero value,” and would be a “major win” for British negotiators, Mr Carthy said.Charles Tannock, a pro-remain Conservative Party MEP, said the final Brexit agreement on the Border would have to be “watertight.” Mr Tannock warned there was a danger if the agreement was unpalatable to hard Brexiteers, some of “the crazies” in the Conservative Party would seek to remove Ms May and “tear up” the commitments after Brexit. Some quarters of the Conservative Party held the view Ireland was still akin to a “vassal state” that should follow the will of Britain, he told a media briefing of Irish journalists.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"queen knights garter hundreds line streets windsor greet royals","story":"Hundreds have watched the spectacle of the Queen and Knights of the Garter attending the Garter service at the chapel where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex marriedGosport hospital: GP oversaw \u0026#39practice of shortening lives\u0026#39 that killed 456 patients as report urges police to actPMQs analysis: Ed Miliband asks the question Corbyn wouldn\u0026#39tProtesters heckle Kirstjen Nielsen over child separation policy as she eats at Mexican restaurantTrain chaos left Rolling Stones fans with two hour walk after gigMariano Rajoy returns to beach town property registrar job after being ousted as prime ministerComment: The NHS must not blow its birthday money on old-fashioned ideas Comment: Only the very haughty or very insecure insist on being addressed by their titles\u0026#39He wasn\u0026#39t in there to die, he was in there to recover\u0026#39: Families of Gosport victims speak outWhen is the summer solstice?

It is the best tool the international community has to address impunity in an imperfect world and to advance many of our international goals.That’s why we will continue to support and champion it.Mrs Haley announced last year that Washington was reviewing its membership of the 47-country body.The US is halfway through a three-year term and its departure marks the first time that a sitting member would volunteer to step aside.Libya was suspended in 2011 after a government crackdown on unarmed protesters.  Under President George W Bush the US refused to join the Geneva-based forum when it was created in 2006, but did so after President Barack Obama took office in 2009.Established to promote human rights worldwide the council has passed more than 70 resolutions critical of Israel, 10 times as often as it has criticised Iran.The US move came as Donald Trump achieved his highest job rating since the first week of his presidency.For the first time since January 2017 he recorded an approval figure of 45 per cent in a weekly Gallup poll.It meant Mr Trump\u0027s popularity was exactly the same as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan at the same stage of their presidencies, while Barack Obama was at 46 per cent.The poll was conducted over the course of last week and reflected a strengthening economy, falling unemployment, and the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.It was unclear how much the poll had been affected by a growing furore over a new zero tolerance policy of separating illegal immigrant parents from their children at the Mexican border.A separate Quinnipiac poll showed 66 per cent of Americans oppose the controversial policy, although 55 Per cent of Republicans support it.Donald Trump has faced fierce criticism for the so-called \u0026#34zero-tolerance\u0026#34 policy that forcibly removes children from their parentsThe policy means all illegal immigrants are now detained and prosecuted, and their children are removed and held in separate detention centres.The  UN human rights chief Zeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein criticised the policy on Monday, calling it unconscionable.Mrs Haley hit back on Tuesday, attacking the council for its own “hypocrisy”. The council’s current membership includes 14 countries that are ranked as “not free” by Freedom House: Afghanistan, Angola, Burundi, China, Cuba, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iraq, Qatar, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.Once again, the United Nations shows its hypocrisy by calling out the United States while it ignores the reprehensible human rights records of several members of its own human rights council, she said.In the past, illegal immigrant families were caught and released while they awaited proceedings. Over a six-week period more than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents, and photographs have emerged of minors being held in wire mesh cages.A secretly recorded tape also emerged of Central American children at a detention centre in Texas crying and pleading for their parents as a guard joked: We have an orchestra here.Mr Trump on Tuesday said America was being infested by illegal immigrants and members of the MS-13 gang, and blamed Democrats for the crisis.He wrote on Twitter: Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our country, like MS-13. They can’t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters! We must always arrest people coming into our country illegally.People protest against the Trump administration policy of separating immigrant familiesAsked if Theresa May thought it was acceptable to cage children, the prime minster\u0027s spokesman said: The welfare and safeguarding of children is at the heart of our immigration policy. We do not separate child refugees or asylum seekers from their families.Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, dismissed comparisons to Nazi concentration camps. He told Fox News: Well, it\u0027s a real exaggeration, of course. In Nazi Germany, they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country.There was condemnation from all four living US former first ladies, and a host of senior Republicans including Senator John McCain. Ted Cruz, the high profile conservative Republican senator from Texas, also said he was horrified and that this has to stop.Mr Cruz said he was introducing a bill in Congress to allow illegal immigrant families to stay together in temporary shelters.Mr Trump was scheduled to meet with Republicans in Congress to discuss potential immigration bills on Tuesday night.  At a meeting for small business owners on Tuesday, he said: We want to solve this problem. I don\u0027t want children taken away from their parents.When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally, which should happen, you have to take the children away.He said there were only two choices - totally open borders or criminal prosecution.Mr Trump said he was asking Congress for a third option.Democrats accused the president of using the separation of families as a negotiating tool as he sought to strong-arm them into supporting funding for a border wall.Meanwhile, more than $4.8 million was raised on Facebook to help separated families with legal services.It was the social network\u0027s largest ever fundraiser and those donating included chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.Please review our commenting policyGosport hospital: GP oversaw \u0026#39practice of shortening lives\u0026#39 that killed 456 patients as report urges police to actPMQs analysis: Ed Miliband asks the question Corbyn wouldn\u0026#39tProtesters heckle Kirstjen Nielsen over child separation policy as she eats at Mexican restaurantTrain chaos left Rolling Stones fans with two hour walk after gigMariano Rajoy returns to beach town property registrar job after being ousted as prime ministerComment: The NHS must not blow its birthday money on old-fashioned ideas Comment: Only the very haughty or very insecure insist on being addressed by their titles\u0026#39He wasn\u0026#39t in there to die, he was in there to recover\u0026#39: Families of Gosport victims speak outWhen is the summer solstice?

Heading a team of just seven, Mr Rajoy told reporters gathered outside the Property Registry office on Wednesday morning that he was “not nervous about my first day” - a sentiment evident in his arrival almost 50 minutes after the 9am start time.Pressed to comment on the leadership race his departure has prompted in the conservative Popular Party, Mr Rajoy declined, explaining that he did “not have much more to say”.“I am retiring from politics and returning to where I was, he said. “I have nothing to pass on to the candidates, apart from what I have already said, that I’m going, but life goes on and the PP is a great party.”Mr Rajoy occupied the registrar post in Santa Pola for just two years before leaving in 1990 to focus on his political career. He never formally relinquished the place in Spain’s College of Property Registrars, however, instead opting to have it temporarily filled by a close friend and local businessman, an arrangement continued for almost three decades. The leader who occupied La Moncloa, the prime minister\u0027s official residence, for the last seven years seemed to be enjoying his return to everyday life. Ahead of his day in the office - which closes at 5pm - he was spotted going for a morning jog along the beachfront promenade in Alicante, before stopping for breakfast nearby. But a yearning for normality may not be Mr Rajoy’s only motivation. While he was commended by supporters for choosing a provincial civil service post over the pension reserved for former prime ministers, the decision may also prove a profitable one.

Mark Carney has previously warned that a central bank’s role is to deliver price stability not lasting prosperity.However, other central banks are targeted on measures other than inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia, for example, both have increased employment as part of their respective remits.The report\u0027s author, Graham Turner, chief economist at GFC Economics, will say: “There are deep-seated structural problems in the UK economy. Recent poor economic data underlines the scale of the difficulties. The UK is ill-prepared to face the challenges of life outside the European Union.Without major changes to economic policy, the UK will be marginalised, left behind by countries with higher levels of investment in technology.Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money welcomed the report but said the BoE\u0026nbspshould go further to boost the economy.“It is encouraging to see a major political party thinking seriously about the biggest challenges facing our economy, namely how UK finance can be reconfigured towards productive lending and investment, Ms Boait\u0026nbspsaid.“Particularly welcome is the report’s proposal to extend the Bank of England’s mandate so that it targets productivity growth.“However, in order to influence productivity growth, the Bank of England will require new tools to inject demand into the real economy. Such tools could include overt monetary financing, which would give the Bank the power to create new money which can be spent, via the Government, on productive investment in public goods such as infrastructure, house building, or social care.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The problem is particularly stark in disadvantaged areas\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineTeachers who are inexperienced, or do not have a degree in maths, are more likely to teach Year 7 to Year 9 pupilsSecondary school pupils in the most disadvantaged schools are being hit hardest by England’s maths teacher shortages, according to research.Students from all year groups in the most disadvantaged schools are much more likely to be taught by an inexperienced teacher, a report from the Nuffield Foundation has found.At A-level, maths students in the most disadvantaged schools are almost twice as likely to have an inexperienced teacher as in the least disadvantaged schools - 9.5 per cent versus 5.3 per cent.Teachers who are inexperienced, or do not have a degree in maths, are\u0026nbspmore likely to teach\u0026nbspYear 7 to Year 9 pupils than older year groups, especially in schools with more disadvantaged pupils.There is a shortage of maths teachers in England as a result of departments losing 40 per cent of teachers during their first six years in the profession, moves to increase participation in maths for 16-18 year olds, and higher private sector wages for maths graduates, the report states.The foundation commissioned researchers from FFT Education Datalab to examine how secondary schools have responded to this shortage of maths teachers, and the impact it has on students.Using data from England\u0027s School Workforce Census, researchers found that schools are deploying their most\u0026nbspwell-qualified maths teachers for students taking GCSEs and A-levels.This is partly because only 44 per cent of practising maths teachers have a degree in maths, compared with 65 per cent of English teachers with an English degree.Almost a fifth (19 per cent) of Key Stage 3 maths teachers are inexperienced compared with 7 per cent at Key Stage 5 – and this exposure to inexperienced maths teachers earlier on risks switching pupils off maths at an age when they are forming attitudes to subjects and future choices.Sam Sims, research fellow at FFT Education Datalab, said: Ofsted have questioned whether the first half of secondary school are \u0027wasted years\u0027 for pupils. Our research shows that teacher shortages mean schools are increasingly saving their experienced, appropriately qualified maths teachers for the crucial GCSE years.This leaves pupils in Year 7, 8 and 9 to be taught by whoever is left. The problem is particularly stark in disadvantaged areas.Josh Hillman, director of education at the Nuffield Foundation, said: This research shows that many schools are struggling to allocate specialist or experienced maths teachers to younger pupils, particularly in disadvantaged areas, which could have an adverse effect on their progression in the subject and their attitudes to it.This is a systemic problem and not one that can be solved by inidual schools where they are trying to increase the amount of maths teaching in a time of a critical shortage of maths teachers.”He added: The Nuffield Foundation welcomes new financial incentives to both schools and trainee teachers, but the government should also consider other aspects of teacher recruitment and retention, such as workload, working hours, and the lack of options for flexible and part-time working.UK news in picturesFormer TV presenter John Leslie leaves Edinburgh Sheriff Court, he is accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers as they danced at her hen night.Prime Minister Theresa May finishes speaking following visiting patients at the Royal Free Hospital in London.

More schools should\u0026nbspfollow their lead\u0027Click to followThe Independent OnlineMatt Hancock, the culture secretary, has called on more headteachers to ban phonesStudents should not be allowed their mobile phones during school hours, the culture secretary has said.Matt Hancock suggested more headteachers should confiscate mobile phones from children at the start of the day, as he warned\u0026nbspmobiles can have a “real impact” on students’ achievements.The minister is concerned social media use can expose children to “risks” – including cyberbullying.Writing in the Daily , Mr Hancock questioned why young children needed phones at school in the first place.He said: “There are a number of schools across the country that simply don’t allow them.“I believe that very young children don’t need to have access to social media. They are children after all. They need to be able to develop their social skills in the real world first.”Schools already have the freedom to ban or curb the use of mobile phones during the school day – and Mr Hancock said there was evidence to suggest banning phones in schools worked.“While it is up to inidual schools to decide rather than government, I admire headteachers who do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day. I encourage more schools to follow their lead,” he said.His comments come as a group of Tory MPs have urged for a ban on mobiles during the school day, saying there is evidence it can have “a beneficial effect on pupils’ ability to learn”.In a letter to the , the seven politicians cited a 2015 study by the London School of Economics, writing: “Where schools banned smartphones from the premises, or required them to be handed in at the start of the day, pupils’ chances of getting five good GCSEs increased by an average of two per cent.“The improvement was even more marked for lower-achieving pupils.

Mark Carney has previously warned that a central bank’s role is to deliver price stability not lasting prosperity.However, other central banks are targeted on measures other than inflation. The US Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia, for example, both have increased employment as part of their respective remits.The report\u0027s author, Graham Turner, chief economist at GFC Economics, will say: “There are deep-seated structural problems in the UK economy. Recent poor economic data underlines the scale of the difficulties. The UK is ill-prepared to face the challenges of life outside the European Union.Without major changes to economic policy, the UK will be marginalised, left behind by countries with higher levels of investment in technology.Fran Boait, executive director of Positive Money welcomed the report but said the BoE\u0026nbspshould go further to boost the economy.“It is encouraging to see a major political party thinking seriously about the biggest challenges facing our economy, namely how UK finance can be reconfigured towards productive lending and investment, Ms Boait\u0026nbspsaid.“Particularly welcome is the report’s proposal to extend the Bank of England’s mandate so that it targets productivity growth.“However, in order to influence productivity growth, the Bank of England will require new tools to inject demand into the real economy. Such tools could include overt monetary financing, which would give the Bank the power to create new money which can be spent, via the Government, on productive investment in public goods such as infrastructure, house building, or social care.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That is the ultimate date, otherwise we cannot be assured to have a vote in plenary in March.”Mr Verhofstadt said he remained optimistic of a deal in the autumn – despite the UK and EU remaining far apart on key issues – but warned: “You cannot go beyond 2018.”The comment came as the former Belgian prime minister dismissed both of the solutions put forward by Theresa May to solve the impasse over future customs and the Irish border.On the prime minister’s preferred “customs partnership” – under which the UK would collect EU duties – he said: “No, we cannot outsource our competences on customs duties. That will not happen.And he warned the rival, technology-based “max fac” idea could bring the return of violence to Ireland, by requiring cameras and a border, calling it “a dangerous step to do”.Hopes of a Brexit deal by October have all but evaporated with the negotiations deadlocked over customs, Ireland and European Court oversight\u0026nbsp– which would push back any agreement until the next EU summit in mid December.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Most agreements at summits are struck beforehand by backroom officials, and previous pre-cooked Brexit conclusions have been approved within minutes by leaders.It marks an escalation in the language by the national leaders and a warning shot across the PM\u0027s bow after months of deadlock.The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland.Ms May is also attending the Brussels summit – which is on the same day as the England vs Belgium World Cup match – but will be excluded from the section on Brexit. EU member states have since the start of the process said they do not want to negotiate with the PM directly, instead delegating the task to Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier.The news comes ahead of a House of Commons showdown for the Prime Minister on Wedneday, where she could be defeated on whether the Government must offer a truly meaningful vote to\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon the state of talks at the end of the year – potentially opening the to her agreement with the EU being rejected.\u0026nbspMr Barnier warned on Tuesday in a speech in Vienna that the British government needed a dose of “realism” about what could be achieved in a deal between the EU and UK and that certain things would “no longer be possible” outside the bloc. He confirmed that Britain would not get direct access to EU-only criminal and security databases, the\u0026nbspEuropean Arrest Warrant, or be able to manage Europol or Eurojust after it left.Addressing “some in the UK”, he said: “They try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It will mean wasting time, and we don’t have time.”Talks have in part been deadlocked because the Prime Minister has limited room for manoeuvre in Westminster, with no majority for her party and hemmed in by Northern Irish unionists and Tory Eurosceptics on whom she relies to pass votes in the House of Commons.The UK earlier this month published a plan for a backstop solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but EU officials immediately picked holes in the plan and said it raised more questions than it answered.A separate British government policy paper which will attempt to propose a long-term customs arrangement between the EU and UK as a whole has reportedly been delayed until July, after the June 28 and 29 summit. Next week\u0027s meeting is the last before the October Council meeting, which the EU says a deal must be agreed by in order to give time for ratification and approval.The draft European Council conclusions seen by The Independent say: “1) In light of the state of play presented by the Union negotiator, the European Council welcomes the further progress made on parts of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement.“2) The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland. It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal. It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Attacks on humans are supposed to be as rare as winning the lottery and being struck by lightning at the same time.

They\u0026nbspfound only Ms Tiba’s footprints, her flashlight, her machete and slippers.The snake was found a few dozen yards from Ms Tiba’s belongings. It was 23 feet long and so bloated it could barely move, with a large bulge midway down its body.The villagers killed the snake and opened it up to find Ms Tiba intact inside the snake, clothed just as she had been when she went to check the corn.Found in the Middle East, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, the cobra’s venom can kill a human within 15 minutes and an elephant in three hours.

When the downpour finally came, it was worse than anyone feared.In just four days, Cox’s Bazar received two-thirds of the average rainfall expected in the month of June. More than 100 landslides have been reported, several people have died and hundreds of families have been made homeless, forced to sleep in mosques or crowd into shelters with their relatives.Ahead of World Refugee Day\u0026nbspon Wednesday, the UN released a report showing that the number of displaced people in the world has risen to a new record high of 68.5 million, and highlighting the plight of the Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar as one of the biggest drivers pushing up that number.But speaking from Cox’s Bazar in a break in the weather that has coincided with the end of the Ramadan fast, Caroline Gluck, a senior official with the UN’s refugee agency, said their message this year was to “celebrate” World Refugee Day as a tribute to those struggling through such hardship, and the charities fighting to help them.As is the case with the wider refugee crisis across the globe, the population of those displaced in Bangladesh is made up mostly of women and children. Aid workers have found that creating women-only centres for healthcare, counselling and childcare is having a dramatic impact on the Rohingya’s quality of life.Rohingya women and girls are taught sewing, play games, receive medical care and are offered counselling at women-only centres run by charities like IRC in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Jessica Wanless)“In any crisis, women and children are the most vulnerable,” Ms Gluck told The Independent - a problem only exacerbated as flooding and landslides cripple camp infrastructure. “Night-time can be a worrying time, particularly if you have to travel to use toilets. The camp is quite sprawled, and instead of living alongside people you know, you are living with strangers.”One of the charities providing women-only centres is the International Rescue Committee (IRC). Dalia Al-Awqati, IRC’s emergency director in Bangladesh, said up to 80 per cent of the refugees are women and children and in need of “specialised support”.“Many Rohingya women and girls have been raped, seen their husbands and children killed before their eyes and lots of them are facing raising their children alone,” she told The Independent. “They live in a situation that is exacerbated by the presence of stigma and discrimination.”IRC\u0027s women-only centres (Jessica Wanless)For 12-year-old Azara, the centre is an oasis of normalcy in a situation that is anything but, and a welcome break from the boredom that comes with living in a refugee camp.She said she came to the centre every day, finding a safe space where she can make friends, play games and engage in her favourite pastime - henna.“It feels like home,” she said. “We come straight after we have been to school. Every week there is at least one day for sewing. Every week we learn something new. We love to learn.”Ex-UN ambassador says \u0027destroying Rohingya exceeds costs\u0027 for MyanmarRohingya facing \u0027crisis on top of crisis\u0027 as world looks other wayRohingya say Myanmar singled out the educated in genocideArmed Rohingya group massacred Hindus in Myanmar, report alleges\u0027Bittersweet\u0027 Ramadan for Rohingya Muslims forced to flee their homesMs Gluck said centres like those run by the IRC were vital to encourage women “carrying the burden” of what happened to them in Myanmar to come forward and seek counselling and support, in what is traditionally a very culturally conservative society.Media reports have previously highlighted a spike in births nine months after the alleged brutal crackdown by Myanmar’s army in Rakhine state that forced the Rohingya to flee. The danger, Ms Gluck said, is that all pregnancies in the camp become stigmatised as potentially being the result of rape.And one of the biggest positives to come out of the creation of the centres has been the number of female volunteers working to foster new communities in their makeshift home.A lot of women are taking on jobs as safety volunteers or in counselling their fellow refugees directly, having received training from NGOs. “It has helped women to develop roles that they didn’t have back home,” Ms Gluck said.Senwara stands in the Kutupalong refugee camp in Cox\u0027s Bazar (Timothy NesmithIRC)Senwara, a 35-year-old mother of four, is a volunteer who helps spread word about the centre to other refugees. She became the only female “Majhi” or community leader in her area of the camp after helping distribute food aid, and sees promoting the centre as part of her responsibility.“Women come here to this centre because there are no men,” she said. “If there were men, families would not let teenagers or women giving birth come here because they would feel shy. They are serious about this matter.”Ms Gluck said the few days of good weather, plus celebrations around Eid, had brought “joy to many faces” in the camps. There is an upbeat mood also to coincide with World Refugee Day, with singing, volleyball and other competitions put on to showcase the best of life in the camps.Rohingya Crisis in Photos Rohingya

of the Earth\u0026rsquos crust.The fault line extends about 10 miles into the Earth and is an intricate system of crushed and broken rock along the Californian coast.According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the fault line extends from Northern California, through San Francisco and down and just north of Los Angeles.The USGS said: \u0026ldquoThe San Andreas fault forms a continuous narrow break in the Earth\u0027s crust that extends from northern California southward to Cajon Pass near San Bernardino.US GEOLOGICAL SURVEYCalifornia earthquake: The San Andreas fault line runs along the Californian coastGeologist Susanne J\u0026aumlnecke, Utah State University, constructed a detailed structural map of this fault line fragment to identify a \u0026ldquotranspressional, 1\u0026ndash4-km-wide ladder-like structure dubbed Durmid Hill.The Durmid Hill was found to extend northwest from the San Andreas fault and east into a newly identified East Shoreline fault zone.In the study, Dr J\u0026aumlnecke wrote: \u0026lsquoThe great width of the East Shoreline fault zone in Durmid Hill and the even larger with and spatial extent of the Durmid ladder structure imply that surface faulting hazards from a major earthquake rupture in this part of the San Andreas fault zone might\u0026nbspbe dispersed\u0026nbspacross a 40 square kilometres area, if both master faults and the intervening cross faults are activated at once.However, the geologist noted it is still unclear how this newly discovered structure interacted with past earthquakes along the fault line.JANECKE ET AL AND LITHOSPHERECalifornia earthquake: Geologists uncovered a new fault in California US GEOLOGICAL SURVEYCalifornia earthquake: The USGS said major earthquakes cannot be predicted The uncertainty makes it hard to predict future earthquake behaviour, Dr J\u0026aumlnecke added, and until recently geologists only focused on the active San Andreas fault.But the size and geometry of the East Shoreline fault zone and Durmid Hill both suggest the zones could fail in the event of a single earthquake.The study noted: \u0026ldquoIf ladder-like strike-slip fault zone rupture in a piecemeal fashion they will have an especially unpredictable surface-faulting hazard.According to the USGS, large earthquakes along the San Andreas fault have occurred roughly every 150 years in the past 1,400 to 1,500 years.The last major earthquake struck the fault in 1906 in the San Fransisco Bay Area but the USGS is not convinced the scale and intensity of future earthquakes can

unannounced.\u0026ldquoSuch an earthquake may be preceded by an increase in seismicity for several years, possibly including several foreshocks of about magnitude 5 along the fault.\u0026ldquoBefore the next large earthquake, seismologists also expect to record changes in the Earth\u0027s surface, such as a shortening of survey lines across the fault, changes in elevation, and effects on strainmeters in wells.The USGS noted historical data does not provide enough information to establish whether or not a pattern exists in the timing of earthquakes in

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky. Sent in by Connor David, via email.Picture research: Alfie Snelling.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I love salad.”Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I’m totally neutral when it comes to politics.” (Dyed-in-the-wool BBC left-of-centre about everything).And Love Island, Alex on Megan revealing she’s a stripper: “I think that showed such character and strength.

There, he earned the nickname the Desert Fox for being a wily and aggressive commander.He achieved stunning victories against the Allies but they eventually emerged triumphant in 1943.He returned to Europe to oversee defenses in Normandy before taking part in the 1944 plot to kill Hitler by blowing up his Wolf’s Lair.Hitler survived and offered Rommel the choice of a trial or suicide. He took the latter option, killing himself using a cyanide pill in October 1944, aged 52.And last October students were condemned for wearing jackets with  I love rape and I love Vegas concerts written on them.Other messages on the jackets included F*** the Syrians and scrawls of Nazi swastikas.Oscar winning actress Emma Thompson’s son Tindyebwa Agaba said he encountered racism in his first year studying at the University - leading Thompson to describe Exeter as a fitting home for former BNP leader Nick Griffin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414267033.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather heatwave july forecast azores","story":"Sweltering temperatures are set to arrive by the end of this week and will keep the country baking until the end of the month.It could get so toasty that the record of the hottest day of the year so far could be smashed.Warm air from the Azores is barrelling in after a brief cold front to send the mercury soaring by Friday.Met Office spokesman Graham Madge said: We are looking at seeing the highest temperatures of the year so far.I think that everybody here is optimistic that we will see that.We are reasonably confident that the good conditions will continue into next week.From Sunday we are going to get an injection of air coming in from central Europe and that combined with the home grown warmth mean we could see temperatures getting above 29.1C, we may see a 30C.There will be sunny conditions across the UK for the foreseeable future.James Madden, forecaster for Exacta Weather, told the Daily Star: Our high confidence projections continue to show a massive build of high pressure across our shores from later this week onwards.“This is likely to bathe the country in another prolonged period of very hot weather of potentially epic proportions during the final third of June and into July.“It is now becoming plausible that we could see temperatures approaching or exceeding the 30C (86F) mark across many parts of the country at times within this period.Today and tomorrow is expected to be warm and humid for much of the country, with some rain moving slowly south.After rain clears to the south most areas will be dry and cool.Tomorrow will see some showers across Scotland but these will gradually clear as the day goes on.It will be a dry day for most with some sunny spells, feeling warm in the sunshine but not as muggy."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414754646.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"psychiatrist professor demon possession real exorcisms","story":"Dr Richard Gallagher claims hes seen about 100 true cases of possession over the past 25 years and has even heard the ghostly voices of demons.He said the eerie and shrilling words and sounds which come out of the possessed actually belong to fallen angels.The New York resident told DailyMail: ‘This is what I literally believe.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It eventually docked in the Spanish port of Valencia on Sunday. In Germany, Angela Merkel\u0027s interior minister Horst Seehoffer threatened to defy her by closing German borders to migrants who had already registered in another EU country.Given that all migrants arrive in either Greece, Italy or Spain and register there, this move would mean those three countries agreeing to take them back.Mrs Merkel agreed with Mr Seehoffer that she would secure EU-wide agreement within two weeks on how his demand could be achieved. The issue will be a key focus for the Sunday crisis talks.Although the issue is now highly politicised, ironically the migratory pressures are now far less acute than they were at the height of the crisis in 2015.Figures released this week by Eurostat show that there were 739,000 asylum applications made across the EU in 2017.

The Prime Minister faces a showdown vote in the Commons today (20 June) over whether she should give MPs a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 on Brexit. She\u0027s already been branded sneaky and unforgivable by her own MPs - all very exciting.  But we\u0027re at the stage of Brexit now where even the experts struggle to understand what\u0027s going on. So let us help you. What has actually happened? Why is it so important? And what happens next? Here\u0027s a basic guide.  Remain-backing MPs want a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal between the UK and Brussels. If it\u0027s not good enough, they want the power to send Theresa May back to the negotiating table - instead of crashing out of the EU with no deal. They\u0027ll have the bare bones of this vote in October 2018. But with Brexit Day looming in March 2019, there\u0027s a big row over what happens after that vote. Remainers say MPs need actual power to decide what Theresa May does next if there\u0027s a meltdown, and there\u0027s still no deal everyone\u0027s happy with. Brexiteers say MPs would abuse this power to tie Mrs May\u0027s hands and \u0027stop Brexit\u0027. Why is this happening now?  The House of Lords created a \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 by passing an amendment to the government\u0027s flagship EU Withdrawal Bill . That means Theresa May was forced to fight for her life to defeat it in the House of Commons - otherwise it will become law. The problem is, too many Tory MPs back the idea of a meaningful vote, so she\u0027s had to compromise. Who are the Tory rebels and why are they important?  There\u0027s a cluster of pro-EU Tory MPs, probably a couple of dozen, who are very concerned about the UK\u0027s Brexit plan. Theresa May has few enough MPs that if the rebels team up with Labour, the Lib Dems and SNP , they can defeat her. The key issue is what it will take to push the rebels over the cliff. For months now, the Tory MPs have preferred to work with the government by striking backroom deals instead of dealing actual defeats. Usually only a few ardent Remainers like Dominic Grieve, Ken Clarke and Anna Soubry put their heads over the parapet. But last week it erupted into open warfare after they thought they had a deal with Theresa May - only to be betrayed at the last moment. What do the rebels want?  The rebel plan, led by Dominic Grieve, starts with what everyone agrees on - letting MPs vote on the final Brexit deal this autumn. Then, however, there\u0027s a new step. If MPs or the EU haven\u0027t agreed the plan by 30 November 2018, Theresa May will have to draw up a new plan of what to do next - and ask MPs to approve it. Then, if there\u0027s still no political agreement by 15 February 2019, Theresa May has to hold another vote in the Commons - and this time it\u0027s crucial. In that final vote, MPs could explicitly force her what to do. What has Theresa May offered instead?  Rebels had agreed to compromise on their plan - a bit. But what the Prime Minister has offered is much, much more watered-down. Under her plan, if there\u0027s no agreement by 21 January 2019, she\u0027d have to draw up a plan of what she\u0027ll do next and MPs would vote on it. But crucially, this vote would have no power to actually approve or reject her plan. MPs would only vote to say they\u0027ve considered the matter, which doesn\u0027t really mean anything. And they would be unable to amend the motion they vote on to toughen it up. What happens next?  The House of Lords approved a version of the \u0027meaningful vote\u0027 for a second time, and has sent it back to the House of Commons.  That means Theresa May faces a dramatic showdown when it returns to the House of Commons on Wednesday 20 June, at around 1.30pm. Rebels and Tory ministers will be locked in a furious debate to find a form of words they can all agree on. But after Theresa May let the rebels down once, they won\u0027t be fooled again. If she can\u0027t appease them this time, they could deal her a devastating defeat. Why will just a handful of MPs be crucial?

Lisa Nandy brandished a cache of emails in the House of Commons during Prime Minister’s Questions, accusing Theresa May of either being “incompetent” or hiding them from the public. Mrs May refused to comment on the leaked documents. Included in the documents, Ms Nandy said, were discussions of some rail links in the North of England being not ‘valued’. And she said another discussed ‘handling strategies’, which included ‘propagating myths’ to divert public attention from proposed rail closures.  Ms Nandy said: “After four weeks of Northern Rail chaos passengers in the North of England have had enough. The Government has said Network Rail didn’t deliver and Northern wasn’t prepared. “But I have been handed emails from within the Department for Transport (DFT) that show that ministers and officials were warned of impending chaos as long ago as two years ago. “These emails are a disgrace. In them, officials describe key northern routes as valueless, discuss “classic handling strategies” for Members of Parliament, discuss whether to throw a “sop” to Northern Passenger groups and debate whether to propagate myths in order to divert public attention from agreed planned route closures. “Will the Prime Minister explain to this house why she has withheld this key information from us and from the public or is she so incompetent she literally hasn’t got a clue what is going on within her own government.” "},{"url":null,"title":"theresa makes last minute concession","story":"NewsTheresa May makes last-minute concession on Brexit bill in bid to prevent Remainer rebellionThe Government has proposed to let the House of Commons Speaker decide whether the motion put forward for the ‘meaningful vote’ would be amendable\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter14:20, 20 JUN 2018News (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May has made a last minute concession to her Brexit bill, which could give MPs the power to send her back to the negotiating table if she comes back without a deal.  The Government has proposed to let the House of Commons Speaker decide whether the motion put forward for the ‘meaningful vote’ would be amendable. Previously, Theresa May had insisted the vote would be on an ‘unamendable’ statement - meaning MPs would have their say, but it wouldn’t make a difference in practice. This new plan would give the Speaker the power to change that - and choose to give MPs a veto on the final deal. And it would effectively block ministers from overturning his decision.  MPs will vote tonight on two similar technical definitions of Theresa May\u0027s promise to give Parliament a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal - one proposed by the government, and one proposed by a pro-EU member of May\u0027s Conservative Party, Dominic Grieve. Parliament will decide which version to approve later on Wednesday in what is expected to be a very tight vote. The vote would be politically damaging for May to lose, and could make a \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit less likely. Mrs May’s Brexit team have been frantically negotiating with Remain-backing Tory MPs, hoping to find a compromise that would prevent an embarrassing rebellion.

Guy Verhofstadt said it will take until the end of 2020, when a transition period closes, to put the bones on a political declaration about Britain\u0027s future relationship with the EU. Yet MPs are holding their formal vote on Theresa May\u0027s deal in October 2018. His comments come at a crucial time - hours before MPs vote on how meaningful their vote on Britain\u0027s Brexit deal should be this October. Mrs May is braced for a rebellion as MPs demand more say is given to Parliament.  Mr Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit coordinator, said he expects a very precise political declaration to be in place in October. But he told MPs on the Commons Brexit Committee: We can then start to negotiate what is in this political declaration. It will take more than a few weeks and a few months to do that. I think it shall be necessary to use the whole transition period to detail this political declaration.  He said that detail would include trade relations, security co-operation and other matters that we need more time than three or four months for. He added: That\u0027s not a problem [but] we\u0027ve got to use this whole period to put in practice, put into a detailed agreement, the political declaration.  Mr Verhofstadt also admitted Brexit was a failure on the part of the EU - but claimed it had made Brussels MORE popular by sparking reform. Since Brexit there has been more debate on reform of the EU than we had got in years before, he said. That’s caused by Brexit. He added: I still look at Brexit as failure of the EU. If an important, a key country, like the UK breaking away, it\u0027s difficult to say \u0027oh it\u0027s a success, fantastic\u0027. I think it\u0027s a failure and it has opened our eyes in the EU and accelerated the whole speaking of reform of the EU. That\u0027s true. What we have seen on the continent, if I may say so, after Brexit the European project regained popularity. He also shot down Theresa May\u0027s backstop plan for customs as not acceptable - going further than his EU counterparts in previous weeks. The hearing before the Brexit committee is ongoing. The EU has a customs union. This means all 28 member states can trade with each other without any checks or duties on goods. Theresa May has said Britain will leave this after December 2020, so she can sign trade deals with non-EU countries. But officials have warned a new UK customs system won\u0027t be ready in time. So they\u0027ve devised a \u0027backstop\u0027 - a backup plan that will carry on some EU customs rules in the UK if there\u0027s no deal. It is designed to stop ports grinding to a halt and Northern Ireland setting up border posts, which could lead to violence. Yet Brexiteers were furious because it had no set end date. In a huge Tory row, they warned it would trap Britain half-in, half-out the EU. After frantic last-minute talks, and threats to quit by Brexit Secretary David Davis, a time limit was put in - December 2021. Yet the government only expects to follow that time limit. It is not legally binding. And the EU poured cold water on it. Britain and the EU also disagree about what the backstop will do. EU plans back in March would have kept Northern Ireland aligned with Brussels customs rules, but Theresa May rejected this because it draws a border between the province and the mainland. So she drew up Britain\u0027s own backstop, which is now being put to the EU for discussion. The UK plan is a temporary customs arrangement allowing totally tariff-free trade between the EU and the whole of the UK. So the UK would carry on being in the EU Customs Union in all but name until December 2021. But the UK also wants to sign new trade deals with nations outside the EU. Britain even wants to implement parts of these deals that don\u0027t relate to the backstop. Brussels has repeatedly said this won\u0027t be possible - so the new plan is setting up for a big battle with the EU. And as time ticks on, the backstop will become less of a Plan B and more of a Plan A. It\u0027ll turn from backstop... to frontstop."},{"url":null,"title":"ascot 2018 day two races","story":"NewsRoyal Ascot 2018: Queen joins Prince Charles and Camilla for carriage procession after horse breaks loose in high streetThe Queen has arrived at the Berkshire course in her traditional carriage procession, followed by the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRachel Bishop14:13, 20 JUN 2018Updated15:07, 20 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Queen has arrived at Royal Ascot 2018 in her traditional procession - just hours after a carriage horse broke loose and went on the run in along high street.

An Ascot spokesperson later confirmed to the  that a carriage horse got loose and was quickly caught after breaking free in Ascot High Street.

Yesterday the excitement seemed to have got a bit too much for quite a few race-goers , who were pictured having a lie down on the grass and swigging from champagne bottles.

The Queen\u0027s horse Seniority will compete in the fifth race The Royal Hunt Cup at 5pm.  The Duke of Sussex watched on as his new wife was pecked on the hand by Dettori, who took top spot in the St James\u0027s Palace Stakes on Without Parole on the first of the five-day event this afternoon.

Louis Fice, 16, was sent home for wearing shorts instead of trousers during the recent heatwave. And now the tough army cadet says he will wear his navy two-inch-above-the-knee skirt every day - borrowed from one of his female friends. The sixth former claims he is now fighting for equality for all genders after teachers scolded him for wearing his makeshift uniform. Louis, a student at Aberaeron high school in Aberaeron, Mid Wales, said: Let’s stop this inequality and get shorts in the dress code - it’s 2018, not 1950.  I got sent home Wednesday for wearing shorts because I was hot and my shorts are \u0027not in the dress code\u0027 yet girls were walking around in skirts. So to break the barrier I turned up in a skirt and was told by every teacher to change. I\u0027m not just fighting for equality for boys, I\u0027m fighting for equality across the board. He described his long trousers as being uncomfortable in the summer - especially with a heatwave forecast for the next week. When I asked why I couldn\u0027t wear a skirt to school, they said it was because I am a boy and can\u0027t wear a skirt.  Personally I identify as a male but I have a few trans friends. How dare they bracket me into a certain category because I look like a boy. He was told off for wearing for a skirt - but allowed to carry on wearing it after a 45 minute lecture. He added he would continue to wear a skirt until his school\u0027s strict uniform policy is changed. Headmaster Owain Jones confirmed pupils are only allowed to wear shorts with his say-so - but he hadn\u0027t granted the short OK this summer.

He also claimed he was banned from Grosvenor Casino back nine years ago.  Both Rainbow Casino and Grosvenor Casino refused to comment when approached by BirminghamLive .  Now Balvinder has revealed his \u0027two corner fraction betting system\u0027 which he claims has made him tens of thousands of pounds in casinos throughout Europe.  The system sees Mr Sambhi play eight numbers by placing a chip on two \u0027corners\u0027. He waits 12 spins where the numbers 8, 9, 11, 12 AND 26, 27, 29, 30 do not win. Then he places two chips on two corners, to ensure he wins if the ball lands in 8,9,11, 12 or 26, 27, 29 and 30. He then waits another 12 losing spins with no winning appearance of those numbers, before repeating the bet - which he says offers him odds of 4.5/1.  Mr Sambhi, 46, said: ‘‘I’ve never lost with my system and the casinos don’t like that. ‘‘They don’t want winners in their premises – just losers. “I even deliberately lose on some days to give the casino a little back so I am not seen as a constant winner. Mr Sambhi has written a book about his system called Breaking The Roulette Wheel. He added: “Experts have always said that winning at roulette is just down to luck. But I’ve developed a system based on simple mathematics which helps me win every time I play. “Some days I win a little and some days a lot.

It always sounds so easy in theory: grab some crisps and sandwiches, head out to the nearest green space with the family and let the good times roll. But in reality, there\u0027s always something vital that gets forgotten. Like spoons. Or something to sit on. So to help you enjoy the sunny days in style, we\u0027ve put together some handy tips.  Keep your cool    No one wants a limp, soggy sandwich - so refrigeration is important for lunch. You could keep things cool with a pre-frozen ice pack, but they tend to over-cool the food near them, which can spoil certain foods. Instead it\u0027s better to get a coolbox with a built-in refrigeration system. The Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox is ideal for \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) because you can use either a mains or car power supply to keep those cucumber sandwiches chilled.   Let the kids help make the lunch (yes, really)   If you\u0027ve got small kids, then get them involved in making the lunch. Get some plastic containers, like Halfords Plastic Stacking Containers , currently half price at \u0026pound6, and have them put either fruit or salad into each.   They can either be responsible for their own - or if you\u0027re feeling brave, the whole lunch. Just prepare yourself for a rogue strawberry in the tomatoes!  Be prepared for rain (this is the UK, after all)   There\u0027s no need to worry about sudden inclement weather at a well-planned picnic.  Make sure you pack the Halfords 300 Fully Waterproof Gazebo , \u0026pound69 (was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21). This rather brilliant shelter will hold off heavy rain and offers 50+ UV protection, so no matter what\u0027s happening to the weather - you\u0027re going to be covered.   Also grab the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket , currently half price at \u0026pound10 - so that even if the grass is a bit damp, you can be sure of a dry place to sit.  Armed with these, you\u0027ll be able to eat in comfort whatever the British weather brings.  Don\u0027t compromise on cutlery  No matter what you packed for your picnic you\u0027re going to want to eat it off something nice. Taking plates, bowls and cutlery means that you can take anything you like on your picnic. In the mood for pasta, rice, or potato salad? No problem, if you\u0027ve got knives and forks for all.   These Halfords sets of bowls, plates and cutlery all come in awesome bright colours - and they\u0027re all currently half price. Packs of six Bowls , six Plates , and 18 pieces of Cutlery are priced at just \u0026pound3 each. All-in-all that\u0027s a lot of mouths you\u0027ll be able to feed in rainbow style!   The Five Fs      The \u0027five Fs\u0027 are the key to a great picnic. The first four are family, friends, food and furniture. We\u0027ve dealt with food already, and it\u0027s nice and cool, thanks to the coolbox. You\u0027ve got your family and friends with you too - and they all need somewhere to sit. That\u0027s where the furniture comes in.  For optimum comfort grab some Urban Escape Moonchairs for the adults, \u0026pound30 (half price) and a few Kids Folding Chairs \u0026pound5, (half price) for the little ones.   A Halfords Roll Up Aluminum Table , \u0026pound20 (was \u0026pound30, save \u0026pound10) will finish this off to perfection.   Now, the adults can sit back with a glass of wine - served in durable Acrylic Wine Glasses , (half price at \u0026pound5 for four) - while the kids take care of the final \u0027F\u0027...   Fun!

Mia Clark, 43, said the fanged creature was under her son Oliver\u0027s duvet when she went to change the sheets. She was stunned when she found the proper sinister spider on the mattress and now fears her children will be bitten.  The mum-of-two, from Chelmsford, told Essex Live that her family\u0027s home has been plagued by spiders and she suspects there\u0027s a nest nearby.   Mia, who was bitten by a spider last year, said: It\u0027s quite worrying to find one in your two-year-old\u0027s bed. It was just lucky he wasn’t in it. When I went to change his bed, I lifted the duvet up and the spider was on the mattress, a proper sinister one. Mia and her partner, Adam, 35, have found several spiders crawling around their home.  She said: There is something going on as they are increasing but it\u0027s difficult to find where the nest is. There must be one because I have seen baby spiders. They have intensified this year but I have got to do something about it - it\u0027s too much of a risk for my children. Last year, a neighbour told Mia they had found a false widow in their garage, which is connected to hers. She went in later that day, and that evening discovered her wrist had become swollen.  Mia said of the bite: I thought \u0027What on earth is that?\u0027 The next day it started to look infected and swollen. I went to the doctors saying I thought I was bitten and the doctor said I had been and gave me antibiotics. When the swelling went down you could see the two puncture wounds and as far as I am concerned that is what it was. Mia is allergic to penicillin, ibuprofen, walnuts, pollen and grass, and believes this is why she experienced a severe reaction to the spider bite. She fears her children could suffer a similar reaction if they are bitten.  The mum said she found two false widows last year, but over the past few weeks she has seen at least five in her home, including her bathroom, master bedroom and both of her children\u0027s bedrooms. She destroyed four of them and captured the one found in her son\u0027s bed. She kept it in a jar to show pest control. Luckily, her son hasn\u0027t accumulated a fear of spiders and was not traumatised from the event. Mia said: My son is little still and isn\u0027t scared of spiders. He was with me at the time when I found the false widow in his bed and I was trying to be calm in front of him and just said \u0027ooh there’s a spider\u0027.

Mr Badawood is on trial at Hull Crown Court and denies rape, controlling or coercive behaviour, and two allegations of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Police were called and Mr Badawood, of Pearson Park, west Hull, was arrested, Hull Daily Mail reports. The complainant was interviewed and said that because of her country of origin she was looked down on in terms of status compared to a Saudi Arabian national.  She claimed to have been raped by Mr Badawood when he tied her legs with a jacket belt so she could not move them. She also claimed that on another occasion, Mr Badawood hit her with a large water bottle because she would not give him her mobile phone. Describing how the alleged incident continued, Miss Baines said: He grabbed her by her clothes and started shaking her and then started to strangle her with both hands while she was on her stomach. He was strangling her so hard she could not breathe. Mr Badawood is then said to have told the woman he would not leave her alone unless he killed her or made her crazy. That incident allegedly caused bruising and swelling to the complainant\u0027s throat and face, which another friend saw when her scarf slipped, the court heard.

This is now a real possibility for brides-to-be, as a restaurant has created the ultimate wedding bouquet - and it\u0027s made entirely from pizza. Forget the flowers, it\u0027s all about dough, cheese and pepperoni.  Made by Villa Italian Kitchen in New York City, the restaurant is hoping that the quirky product, which features pieces of pizza rolled up to look like flowers, will take off and become this summer\u0027s hit wedding trend.

Jessie Vard, 19, from Donegal, has reportedly been charged over revealing shots of her promoting illegal betting sites. She has allegedly been involved in large numbers of promotions for gambling sites - which are illegal in the country - but often used by models who write their domains across their cleavage. Some earn the equivalent of tens of thousands of pounds a month. But ahead of the World Cup, Thai authorities have been cracking down on football gambling and those who promote them online.  Vard has amassed millions of fans since moving to Bangkok as a child and later becoming a glamour model. She was reportedly among 15 models who were named in warrants summoning them to appear at court which were issued by police last week. Yesterday the model and four other girls turned themselves in at Bangkok’s Phayathai Police Station, it is reported.  She is believed to have confessed to violating anti-gambling laws, which carry a maximum penalty of a year in prison and/or a fine of \u0026pound24 (1,000 baht). Vard reportedly apologised publicly on behalf of the entire group of models who allegedly promoted the gambling sites.  She said: \u0027\u0027I did not know that gambling sites were illegal. I apologise to everybody and accept my mistake.  Please do not become involved with these sites.\u0027\u0027 The other models charged were Paradee Koosinsap, 21, Saitarn Yim-ampai, 20, Nirada Kuenongkun, 25, and Thanyakarn Lojin, 23. They have all been released on bail and will be sentenced later this month. Maj. Gen. Panurat Lakboon, deputy head of Bangkok’s politan Police, said 1,115 people have been arrested on charges related to online gambling since May 2 this year.  Bank accounts worth more than a million dollars had also been frozen as a result, he said.

Stood underneath a sagging \u0026shymakeshift shelter, I look on as jagged bolts of lightning streak the black sky and the wind whips up. This temporary city, cobbled together in less than a year with bamboo poles, scraps of tarpaulin and twine, looks like it will be knocked down any instant. For the 700,000 Rohingya refugees here in Bangladesh – who have escaped the worst genocide of this century in neighbouring Myanmar – the storms I witness are just the beginning of a three-month nightmare.  Their temporary homes are directly in the path of the cyclones that plague this vulnerable region from now until September. After being tortured and raped – and seeing their relatives murdered by soldiers in Myanmar who torched their villages – they are now prey to landslides, floods and waterborne diseases. Scores of people have died in recent days, including a two-year-old boy after a mud wall collapsed on him. At a Red Cross field hospital on the edge of the seemingly never-ending Kutupalong camp is nine-month-old Mohammad Ayas.  The helpless little boy broke his thigh bone when he fell from one of the treacherous slopes between the shelters. Icelandic nurse Hildur Sveinsdottir – here for a one-month secondment from her normal A\u0026ampE job – tells me such accidents are soon expected to occur daily. Fractures are very regular for us,” Hildur says. “It’s unimaginable what it will be like in a few weeks. The number of people getting injured or being killed will rise a lot if they get a really bad cyclone. Their shelters will not stand up.”  Experts say more than 200,000 people are at high risk from landslides and floods in the coming monsoon months. More than 1,000 shelters have already been destroyed as rivers of brown water surge through the narrow alleys of the camp, an hour from Cox’s Bazar city, on the southeast coast of Bangladesh. Assisted by aid workers, the Rohingya are digging drainage ditches and reinforcing their shelters.  Despite the extraordinary hardship they have endured, everyone I come across is determined to make the best of an appalling situation. Trucks bearing stacks of bamboo arrive at temporary depots all day long. Many of those collecting the only building materials on offer are boys, straining to carry their heavy load. In many cases, their fathers were murdered in Myanmar. Their mothers guard their precious scrap of land and look after younger siblings.  More than half of the people here are women and at least 60% are under 18. Many of them will be trapped once the paths become impassable. Speaking next to a stagnant pool of fetid brown water, mum Moriom Katu, 35, tells me her eight-month-old son died from dysentery and diarrhoea a few weeks before. “This is our fate,” she says. “We were shot at, burned and tortured as we tried to get away, and now we are here in this terrible location. Everything is so dirty. The water is full of diseases. People are getting sick all the time.”  Now she is concerned that her surviving children, a girl aged seven and a boy aged four, will be struck down by the same illness. There is never a quiet moment for the dedicated Red Cross medics. Hildur says: “We have respiratory problems, malnutrition cases, dehydration and infections that turn to abscesses because the water they have to clean cuts with is dirty. “There has been measles and TB. They want to wash and they want to take care of themselves, but the hygiene is so bad.”  On the 15-bed paediatric ward is a premature baby so tiny that I inhale sharply when I first see her. Unbelievably, Umme Kulsul is two months old. Her arms and legs are the width of an adult finger, but she has grown. Hildur tells me she was just ten centimetres long when she was born by emergency caesarean when her mother, Annuar Begum, 30, was only seven months pregnant. This was due to serious health problems, \u0026shyexacerbated by the escape from Myanmar to Bangladesh.  Since then, Umme has needed 24-hour medical care, yet I am told that in just over a week she will have to go back to the family’s shelter in the squalid camp down the road. It is difficult to imagine how her tiny body will withstand the elements. Equally at risk is Abdullah, 22, whose left leg is encased in bandages. He was shot while trying to flee the military’s reign of terror in Myanmar. “They surrounded my village,” Abdullah tells me. “While some soldiers torched the straw roof of our house, others lay in wait to fire at us.  “We were all screaming but they kept shooting. I was shot in the leg. “The bullet pierced right through my thigh and came out the other side of my leg. My aunt and uncle were killed in the crossfire.” Abdullah’s wound became badly infected because of the unsanitary conditions in the camp, and Red Cross nurses are doing their best to save his leg from amputation. Yet when he returns to his shelter, his wound will be exposed again.

No one was an automatic pick, you had to play for your place.“Before he came to Dens Park it was like that, too many were.“When he came in there was a big clearout. He revolutionised the team.“A lot of the squad were ageing and just going through the motions at the end of their career.“At that time Dundee weren’t expected to do much, they were a big club but, after the success in the early 50s, there were a few years of doing not very much.“He also brought in some older guys who we all wondered about.“He brought in Bobby Wishart, who was 32 at the time, Bobby Seith was 30, but they were revelations.”Shankly also revolutionised the style of football on display at Dens Park.“We were an out-and-out attacking team,” Ure added.“We could defend when we needed to but we used to go at the opposition and test them.“We had a lot of seasoned players like Bobby Cox and Gordon Smith and some really good ones like Alan Gilzean and Alan Cousin. There was a perfect balance to the team.“We wanted to play football – there was no humping it up the pitch and chasing after it.“We were a possession-based team, one of the first in Scotland to keep the ball. It was a European style and that helped us in the European run the next season and why we did so well.“I think that foxed the European teams because they expected the usual Scottish kick and chase so they’d have the ball for 15 minutes at a time – the difference was we were keeping the ball!”That run in Europe saw the Dark Blues hammer Sporting Lisbon and then Anderlecht before falling to AC Milan in the last four.“The Anderlecht game was the best ever. We played at the Heysel Stadium and the whole ground clapped us off at the end, they all rose and clapped.“We were wondering what was happening. We played the stuff you see all great teams play and passed a good side off the park.“They were great days.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2781041b59a-126x180.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc how did it all start for the dark blues","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAt times during their history, Dundee Football Club have proudly boasted of being the city’s oldest professional football club.While celebrations of their 125th birthday this year are confirmation of that, what the Dark Blues can’t claim to be is the first.Indeed, it was the growing popularity of the game late in the 19th century that led to their very existence, through the desire of smaller local outfits to challenge at a national level.The club was in some ways down to the existence of a man about whom little is known. He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/Bus-journey-01-940x372.jpg ","title":"bus firms in plea to ease congestion as commute times in dundee and tayside soar","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRush hour commuting times across Tayside have soared in the past decade, according to a local bus firm.Stagecoach East says that congestion has caused the time taken for some journeys in Dundee and Perth to increase by up to a third in the last decade.The company is now calling for fresh action from politicians to help it reduce congestion and emissions throughout Tayside.Stagecoach East managing director Paul Thomas said “short-sighted” transport policies are having a major impact on local bus users.His comments come after Transport Minister Humza Yousaf retabled new proposals at Holyrood to improve local bus services.Mr Thomas said: “This is not specifically about Stagecoach, or any other bus company – it’s about the impact of congestion on bus passengers and other road users in the area and the situation simply cannot continue if we are to carry on improving the local bus network and our environment.“Our passengers are paying the price for short-sighted policies that have led us to this point – we urgently need politicians to take practical action to get our towns and cities moving again.”According to the bus company, afternoon peak journey times on Stagecoach services from Ninewells Hospital to the city centre have increased by 20% in the last 10 years.Morning peak journey times between Broughty Ferry and Seagate have also increased by 31% over the same period.In Perth, meanwhile, morning peak journey times from Walnut Grove into the city centre have risen by 33% since 2010Mr Thomas added: “Effective bus networks can boost the local economy, improve traffic flow, reduce air pollution and help improve air quality.“We are playing our part by investing in improvements for customers including digital technology, new routes and new vehicles, but we need politicians to play their part to help buses flourish. All of the tools exist for them to take action now.”Stagecoach has written to local MPs, MSPs and councillors about the impact of congestion and how it is affecting customers every day.The company has also reported a 10% decrease in operating speed leading to an 8% rise in operating costs – with fears it could lead to fewer people using buses.The Transport (Scotland) Bill – which could see the introduction of low emission zones in cities, a ban on pavement parking and improvements to smart ticket schemes – is currently making its way through the Scottish Parliament.Xplore Dundee’s new managing director Christine McGlasson recently told the Tele that congestion was a major issue affecting journey times for city customers.According to research issued by Greener Journeys, the UK Government’s seven-year freeze on fuel duty has resulted in a 4% increase in traffic since 2011.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “Stagecoach is referring mainly to local roads and city centre congestion in this instance, although we do appreciate the frustration that delays can cause on our trunk roads and motorways too. Since 2007, more than £6.5 billion has been invested in the network and that includes major improvements which can bring congestion relief, not only on the trunk road network but to local roads, resulting in benefits for car and bus users.“We are continuing to spend more than £250 million a year to support our vital bus industry, allowing operators to keep fares at affordable levels and provide free bus travel to older and disabled passengers.“We also provide support to local authorities via the block grant so that they can support socially necessary bus services.“We have also doubled our active travel budget from £40m-£80m which will greatly improve public health and ease congestion.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan.

He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the

for the last 15 years at The Waterside, the Manson family and I are delighted that the hotel has been bought by a private entrepreneur,\" the 72-year-old said.\"Having already sold the Glen Mhor to Jon it\u0027 a bit like keeping it in the family now by selling him the Waterside.\"I wish him well for the future.\"Mr Manson was 12 years old when his\u0026nbsp father, Donald, a well-known championship piper and a hotelier by trade, bought the Glen Mhor in 1958.He followed his father into the hospitality industry and received the OBE in 2010 for services to tourism.His son, Grant, also joined the family business which expanded over the years.It included the acquisition in 2003 of the Haughdale Hotel, later renamed The Waterside.The official handover took place on the same day Mr Manson supervised a Highland Business Awards lunch at Eden Court Theatre attended by the Queen and Prince Philip.\"As the Queen went out the front door, I went out the back door and hared straight over the Infirmary Bridge to take over the keys,\" recalled Mr Manson.He was pleased the new owner was keeping on the 40-strong team at the hotel which includes a 60-seat restaurant plus a function room with space for 150 people.Mr Erasmus wished\u0026nbspMr Manson and his family all the very best for the future.\"It is a pleasure to be able to take over the Waterside and we are looking forward to building on their success,\" he said.Mr Erasmus, meanwhile, recently lodged a planning application to transform the block between 8 and 14a Church Street into 29 self-catering apartments.He also

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are set to be in place by July next year.Wednesday 20 Jun 2018 3:35

Cricket Club and is also used by three primary schools for a couple of hours a week.In addition, it is used for occasional events including the fireworks display for the city\u0027 annual Hogmanay party and concerts.Campaigners believe greater use could be made of the green space and a new lease life given to the dilapidated buildings by acquiring the site under Scotland\u0027 community asset

reaching the end of its operational life.\u0026nbspAn options appraisal and consultation were commissioned in 2017.Members also agreed it would be sensible to commission a scoping report to give an overview of the whole links area and future options.The report considers the current use of the links and the area\u0027 context within the town, its management and sustainability and potential

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

There is also a small fee to be paid by each exhibitor for every painting or photo that is hung, and this goes to help to cover running expenses.With over 500 people having visited the exhibition in 2017, organisers hope this excellent support from the community will continue. Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"working to preserve the yarns of yesteryear","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 20/06/18, 7:14 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPeople across Argyll and Bute are being encouraged to take part in a unique project that will help to preserve tales about the area for future generations.Argyll and Bute Youth Services is calling on people of all ages to help gather stories, film clips, photographs and objects about the area to celebrate the uniqueness of Argyll and Bute.The Digital Storytelling Project is part of the national Year of Young People and aims to bring together our younger and older generations to share their stories and folklore tales of yesteryear.Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: \u0026#8216This is not only a great way of capturing precious stories about the area, but it’s an excellent opportunity for a mix of generations to work together.\u0026#8216Argyll is teeming with folklore tales, from giant serpents and mermaids being spotted on our coastlines in years gone by, to stories of haunted caves and bloody battles \u0026#8211 we’ve got a lot to talk about.\u0026#8216The Year of Young People is all about bringing generations together and celebrating our young people.

Trainees will be part of the charity’s gardening teams at Brodick, Crathes, Culzean, Greenbank, Hill of Tarvit and Kellie Castle for the next two years.The group will come together regularly throughout the two-year programme for training at Oatridge College, West Lothian.Ann Steele, head of heritage gardening at the National Trust for Scotland, said: ‘Skills shortage is an issue affecting the whole of the horticulture industry, but it’s particularly important for us to address because we love and care for so many of Scotland’s most significant and important heritage gardens.’The National Trust for Scotland currently employs 70 gardeners and has a history of developing gardening talent through its School of Heritage Gardening at Threave, which has been operational for the past 50 years.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12704340.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/35265670_1680890188694011_7257840954613170176_n.jpg","title":"public hunt dog vanished irvine","story":"NewsPublic hunt for dog that vanished on Irvine beachMaisey\u0027s been missing for almost 24 hours.\u0026nbspShareByRoss Dunn11:04, 14 JUN 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA dog owner is urging the public to keep an eye out for her missing pooch.

And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Glee as Melrose Primary choir raises the roof in Perth","story":"PERFORMING pupils from Melrose are officially amongst the best in Scotland.\nThe

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm -

Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

Almost 700,000 Rohingya refugees have fled Burma since last year amid reports of extreme violence and now live in poverty\u0026nbspin giant refugee camps.  Mr Murphy travelled to the Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh in December to see SCIAF\u0026rsquos work with Caritas Bangladesh.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe more attention that the plight of the Rohingya people receive can only be good as hopefully it might move all who see it to do what they can to help.  \u0026ldquoWhenever I travel to places such as the Rohingya camp in Bangladesh I am filled with conflicting emotions. I feel deep sadness and helplessness for the people and the conditions that they have to live under.  \u0026ldquoI feel guilt that I can return to the comfort of my home and family in Scotland but at the same time feel so grateful that my own children don\u0026rsquot have to suffer like the hundreds of thousands of vulnerable young ones at the camp.  \u0026ldquoI question my own role as a photographer and what difference can I really make? And then I reconfirm to myself what I know, that people can make a difference and that the images that I have made might strike a chord with someone, and even if they make a small difference, then that is something.  \u0026ldquoI really hope that people can take a moment out of their busy schedules to visit the exhibition, and contemplate on how the suffering, the strength, the dignity and courage of others can transform our own outlooks and have a direct impact on how we lead our lives.  The free exhibition will later visit Ayr, Dumfries and Edinburgh.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7649408.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ex Scots TV presenter on trial accused of putting hand down woman s trousers and touching her bottom","story":"              A WOMAN has told a court she has nothing to gain from accusing former TV presenter John Leslie of sexual assault.  The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.  The results from the pants and tutu were inconclusive, Ms Coupar-White said.  Mr Ogg questioned if it was possible for Leslie\u0027s DNA to be passed from one item of clothing to another.  The witness said: \"Secondary transfer is possible.\"  The trial before Sheriff Adrian Cottam continues on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"Watch the moment famed Glasgow hairdresser is surprised with   137K Porsche prize","story":"              A FAMED Glasgow hairdresser received the surprise of a lifetime after winning a top-of-the-range Porsche worth \u0026pound137,000.

There had been concern that Glasgow City Council sanctioned the Undersea Defence Technology 2018 event planned due to open next week at the SEC, which is run by a company that is 91% owned by the local authority.  There is further concern that the council\u0027s arms-length leisure services charity Glasgow Life is adding its support to the event, lending its \u0027People Make Glasgow\u0027 city branding to the promotional material.  But now it has been confirmed that the logo has been removed.    BEFORE (above) and AFTER (below).    The event at the Scottish Event Campus, will see dozens of firms from around the world gather to promote defence and security equipment.  BAE Systems and Babcock International, which are designing and constructing a new fleet of Trident nuclear submarines, are lead sponsors of the fair.  The city council in defending the event say it was held in Glasgow in 2008 and had stressed conferences and exhibitions are worth \u0026pound130 million to the local economy each year.  But now Glasgow City Council has confirmed that the while it has not changed \"practical support\" for the event, it had been decided that the People Make Glasgow log should be removed.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur conventions team uses the brand \u0026ndash and, in this case, that reflected the practical support they offer to event organisers and venues in the city.    \u0026ldquoAt the same time, the brand is hugely popular and we appreciate that people in the city feel some sense of ownership of it \u0026ndash which is a really positive thing.  \u0026ldquoThere was clearly some confusion about what it represented on this occasion, so we agreed with the organiser that it was better to remove it.  Scottish CND were among groups that had previously confirmed they planned to hold a demonstration during the three-day gathering, which opens on June 26.  And Jay Sutherland of Scotland Against Militarism said the group \u0026ldquowon\u0026rsquot be backing down until full support is removed.  She said: \"The decision to use the logo was completely hypocritical to begin with when most people in Glasgow who are aware of this Arms Fair oppose it.    \"Scotland Against Militarism and the Sink UDT Campaign first pushed for them to remove the branding with our meeting with Susan Aiken, this was not a decision that the council came to themselves.  \"Most of all it shows that people power works and that the council realise they have got it completely wrong, but they are still refusing to remove full support. They recognise that people have claimed the brand but what they don\u0026rsquot realise is that people own the city too and we are not putting up with this.  \"We won\u0026rsquot be backing down until they remove their full support for the event, nothing less. Otherwise they are simply hiding their interests and involvement.\"    Campaign Against the Arms Trade\u0026rsquos Kate Nevens said it is crucial the council put a framework in place for future events.  She said: \u0026ldquoHosting a major arms fair is completely incompatible with a city like Glasgow, which is anti-nuclear and famous for its opposition to war.  UDT, now in its 31st year, has been sold in promotional material as a forum to allow businesses to \"engage with the undersea defence community, network and meet prospective customers, showcase your products and services and reinforce your commitment to this ever-evolving domain\".      The promoters say it provides arms companies with the chance to \"meet face-to-face\" with over 1,400 international, senior military and industry leaders\".  It is organised by Clarion Events, which has hosted family-friendly gatherings such as the Baby Show, the Horse Show and the Spirit of Christmas. Since 2008, it has acquired six arms fairs and joined the arms industry trade body ADS.  In September last year, more than 100 people were arrested at protests outside a controversial Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair which Clarion organised.  A Sink the Arms Fair coalition opposing the Glasgow event includes Scottish CND, Campaign Against the Arms Trade Scotland, Scotland Against Militarism, Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Dovetales, Food Not Bombs, Catholic Worker and the Scottish Peace Network.  \u0026nbsp  Glasgow Life declined to comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Analysis  Competition to design new Glasgow School of Art should be considered","story":"              In 2014, Charles Rennie Mackintosh\u0026rsquos Glasgow School of Art was assaulted by fire.  The neighbourhood was evacuated, people watched in horror as flames engulfed the building.  The damage was devastating but was contained by extraordinary feats of firefighting to the west wing of the building, and although the exquisite library was lost, no-one was killed or injured.  This time, the flames were hungrier they lit up the night sky and the neighbourhood again cleared of its residents.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspGlasgow School of Art fire: Extent of damage to world-renowned building unveiled in drone footage  The damage is brutal: the entire interior, east and west, is gutted the roof is gone. The renovated library is lost, and what is left of the building is a shell.  There is disbelief, and a simmering, almost palpable anger at this latest catastrophe.  Glasgow Council have stated that \u0026ldquothere is a consensus emerging that the intention of the building control people, Historic Environment Scotland, and the art school is to save the building.  But surely the question is ought it to be replicated?  Charles Rennie Mackintosh was a superb architect, a gifted artist, and above all, a dynamic innovator. It is my contention that he would not approve of pastiche or replication.  Mackintosh won the competition for a new art school in 1897, while working as a draughtsman for Honeyman and Keppie, and attending the old art school part-time.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspHow the world reacted to the Glasgow School of Art\u0026nbspfire  The building was completed in two phases, the first phase in 1899. Over the following years, Mackintosh matured as an architect, honed his pared but organic design skills, and completed the second phase, the west wing.  The entire building was testimony to his creative genius and artistry.  Everyone loves Mackintosh now, but he was not always so well regarded in his home city.  It was 15 years before Honeyman and Keppie deigned to make him a partner, and he did not thrive. He left Glasgow with his wife and fellow artist Margaret Macdonald when architectural work dried up.  Neither has Mackintosh\u0026rsquos built heritage been well protected. In 1945, the Bruce Plan proposed demolishing all of Glasgow\u0026rsquos Victorian and Georgian city centre, including the Glasgow School of Art.  Glasgow\u0026rsquos notorious 1965 road developments obliterated Martyrs School in favour of a ring road and a football field. It was not until the mid-1960s that Mackintosh\u0026rsquos legacy was reappraised.  So, what will happen now? There will be an investigation into the cause of the fire, and a search for fault.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspGlasgow School of Art contractor was previously condemned for fire safety failings  There are questions to be answered about fire protection measures and, if sprinklers were installed, why they were not operational.  At the moment, the future of Mackintosh\u0026rsquos School of Art is uncertain while the structural integrity of what remains is confirmed.  Instead of attempting to turn back time and rushing to create a sad replica, I hope that people will honour Mackintosh by considering alternatives that reflect his extraordinary legacy.  I suggest that a full public debate is warranted that includes the option of an international competition to design a new art school.

Somer and Areeb Umeed Bakhsh, who are 15 and 13 respectively, say they are terrified they will be killed because of their Christian beliefs.  The boys - and their parents Maqsood and Parveen - have failed to secure asylum in the UK after fleeing Pakistan six years ago.  The Bakhsh family are now seeking legal aid to appeal immigration decisions to return them to the sub-continent, where British authorities do not believe they are at risk.  Somer, who is studying five Highers at Springburn Academy in Glasgow and hopes to be an astrophysicist when he is older, said: \u0026ldquoI love Scotland and I do not want to go back to Pakistan.  \u0026ldquoThe thought of it terrifies me and it is very stressful to even imagine going back there.  \u0026ldquoI wouldn\u0026rsquot have a future and I can\u0026rsquot even read or write Urdu.  \u0026ldquoI want to live here in Scotland, it is my country and my home.  Neither he or his brother have spoken before but their parents have been campaigning to stay in Glasgow, where they are members of their local church.  The family fled to Scotland after the murder of two Christians who were gunned down outside a court, while in police custody, in the Pakistan city of Faisalabad in July 2010.  Mr Bakhsh, an elder at Possilpark Parish Church, claims the people responsible for their deaths believe he is in league with them, know exactly who he is and would kill him and his family if they had the chance.  Paul Sweeney, MP for Glasgow North-East, said it would be \u0026ldquoinhumane to deport two teenagers, who are effectively naturalised Scottish boys.  He has urged UK Immigration Minister, Caroline Nokes MP, to give the Bakhsh family permission to stay in the UK while the Home Office urgently re-examines their case.  Areeb, speaking on World Refugee Day, said: \u0026ldquoI have spent most of my life in Glasgow and consider myself a Scottish boy.  \u0026ldquoI do not know anything about Pakistan or the language.  Mr Bakhsh worked as a data analyst in Pakistan and holds two masters degrees, while his wife is a trained neo-natal midwife with 17-years of experience.  But both have been unable to work in Scotland and forced to survive on benefits and charity due to their immigration status.  Mr Sweeney, said: \"I have met the family and was disturbed to learn that they are at risk of deportation to Pakistan where they have already faced discrimination and very real death threats for their Christian beliefs.  \"This family have already contributed a huge amount to our local community of Possilpark in Glasgow through the parish church and are exactly the sort of people that our country should be welcoming with open arms, not casting out to a dangerous future.  \"It is shocking that a highly skilled and motivated family like this have been kept in limbo for so long, unable to work or even drive a car."},{"url":null,"title":"Watchdog calls for mandatory traffic light food labelling after Brexit","story":"              A watchdog has called for mandatory traffic light food labelling post-Brexit after finding that information on breakfast cereals could be misleading consumers about their sugar, fat and salt intake.  Many supermarket own-brands have adopted the traffic light scheme, but Which? found that household names such as Kellogg\u0027s are \"lagging behind\" to leave consumers facing a \"bewildering\" range of information about nutrition and portion sizes.  It found that cereals, porridges and granolas can contain more than three-quarters of the recommended daily maximum of free sugars in a portion - with the true sugar level not reflected on the packaging.  Further confusion could result from companies changing the portion sizes on their packaging or, in the case of Nestle, making comparison with other brands difficult by including a measure of milk in the front-of-pack nutritional information.  Of all the cereals and porridges it looked at, Which? found that Kellogg\u0027s Frosties and Kellogg\u0027s Crunchy Nut Cornflakes contained the most sugar per 100g, with a whopping 37g and 35g each - around the same amount of sugar per 100g as Burton\u0027s Wagon Wheels.  Sugar was the second or third highest ingredient in seven out of 10 flaked cereals included in the Which? study.  Nestle Oats \u0026amp More Almond Cereal contained 25g of sugar per 100g - more than two teaspoons of sugar per recommended 40g portion, while the list of ingredients contained six different forms of sugar including sugar, glucose syrup and honey.  Even some apparently healthy cereals were comparatively high in sugar, such as Kellogg\u0027s All-Bran which contained 18g of sugar per 100g - almost two teaspoons of sugar in a 40g serving.  The cereals lowest in sugar were Nestle Shredded Wheat, which contained no added sugar, and Weetabix Original which contained 4.4g sugar per 100g.  Plain porridge was also a healthy choice, with Quaker Oat So Simple and Ready Brek Original Porridge both containing 1g sugar per 100g.  The NHS states that more than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g is high and 5g of total sugars or less per 100g is low.  The consumer group said shoppers would be \"far better served\" if all manufacturers used the traffic light scheme, which shows a high, medium or low level of sugar, salt and fat using red, amber and green traffic light colours based on the amount per 100g.  Under current EU regulations, this form of labelling is only a voluntary requirement, so some manufacturers are not using it.  Which? is calling on the Government to use Brexit as an opportunity to introduce legislation that makes traffic light labelling mandatory as part of an approach aimed at boosting the nation\u0027s health and well-being.  Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said: \"It is clear that the current, non-standardised food labelling system is at best confusing and at worst misleading.  \"Helping people to compare at a glance how much sugar, salt and fat a product contains has proven to be an effective way of helping them to make healthier food choices.  \"The Government must not miss this opportunity to use Brexit to make traffic light labelling a legal requirement, so consumers finally have clear information to make better and more informed choices.\"  Izzi Seccombe, chairwoman of the Local Government Association\u0027s Community Wellbeing Board, said: \"The traffic light food labelling system is clear, effective and popular with shoppers.  \"Any post-Brexit review of EU food laws gives the Government the opportunity to introduce legislation to standardise food labelling.  \"At a time when two-thirds of adults and more than a fifth of four- and five-year-olds are obese or overweight, helping people make more informed choices about what they eat will clearly also help tackle the obesity crisis we face as a nation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"The Mack can be restored  says Muriel Gray","story":"              THE Mackintosh building, \u0026ldquothe world\u0026rsquos most indestructible building, can be built again, the chairwoman of the Glasgow School of Art has declared.  Muriel Gray said she believes the world-famous building can be restored from the ashes of the disastrous fire of last weekend.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am massively optimistic that we can.  Speaking after closely inspecting the building with other key staff, Ms Gray said construction firm Kier, which was responsible for the building\u0026rsquos renovation following a previous fire in 2014, had \u0026ldquoquestions to answer from the board.  Experts have estimated that it could cost up to \u0026pound200 million to restore the building after its second major fire in four years.  Ms Gray said she did not know how the blaze began.  The broadcaster and writer said: \u0026ldquoPeople are asking, why are you so quiet? We are waiting to be told the real details, so we can tell the public the real facts. The building wasn\u0026rsquot in our custodianship at the time, it was in Kier\u0026rsquos custodianship.  Ms Gray has called an emergency board meeting, which will meet today, to determine the future of the building.  Insurance was in place for the renovation of the building, she noted firmly, and she said the board had been assured a \u0026ldquogold standard fire regime had been installed at the site.

New drone footage shows the famous stone walls in place, but devastation within.  Ms Gray said: \u0026ldquoIt isn\u0026rsquot a goner. It is by no means a goner, it is still there, recognisably standing as the Mack. It is not a few bricks covered in charcoal, it is the Mack, even with its windows burned out, and no roof.  \u0026ldquoSo although it\u0026rsquos a shocking thing to look at, I was actually weirdly heartened by getting to see it.  \u0026ldquoI know it sounds peculiar but it was lot more optimistic than any of us had expected, having seen the flames. It\u0026rsquos like the world\u0026rsquos most indestructible building.  Ms Gray said she believes the building can be saved, but noted: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a massive, massive blow to everyone involved.  \u0026ldquoBut if we are about to start it again, we know so much more about that building than we have ever known.  \u0026ldquoBy heavens, we are armed to the teeth with knowledge of the construction, the detail of it, it will make it even easier to begin it. I am not remotely pessimistic about it.  Ms Gray said that \u0026ldquothe biggest job next is to keep morale going, to roll up our shirt sleeves, and start again.But the will is there to do it.  As for the cost of reconstructing the building, she said \u0026ldquothat is ineffable at the moment. Questions have been asked about anti-fire measures at the site, but Ms Gray was adamant the board had done \u0026ldquoeverything we could to guard against a second blaze.

More than 50 holes dug by people undertaking illegal metal detecting have been found at the Brunton Turret section of the 1,900-year-old World Heritage Site, government heritage agency Historic England said.  Nighthawks, the term for illegal metal detectorists, have targeted the turret and well-preserved section of wall, which was built by the men of the Twentieth Legion of the Roman Army, in their search for ancient artefacts.  The ruins of the Brunton Turret section are surrounded by further buried archaeological remains from the frontier of the Roman empire, which are very vulnerable to damage from nighthawks, Historic England said.  The discovery is the latest in a spate of nighthawking incidents along the wall, at Corbridge, Housesteads and Steel Rigg, over the last three years.  All the sites are protected as scheduled monuments where using a metal detector without proper authorisation is a criminal offence.

Mike Collins, Historic England\u0027s inspector of ancient monuments at Hadrian\u0027s Wall, said: \"We know that the majority of the metal-detecting community complies with the laws and regulations regarding discovery and recovery of objects from the land.  \"But the small number of people who steal artefacts and damage ancient sites are breaking the law and robbing us all of the knowledge and understanding that objects from the past can give us.  \"These nighthawks are committing a criminal offence and we\u0027d like everyone\u0027s help to ensure they are caught.

His SNP colleagues then walked out as part of their protest over what they claim is a \"power grab\" over Brexit.  Mr Blackford told the Press Association: \"Is what we did last week, is that a one-off and is that the end of it?  \"It most certainly isn\u0027t and what we do want to signal to the Government in London (is) that this will not be business as usual, our relationship with the Government, which will remain courteous, will be very different and we will seek to hold the Government to account as and when we can.  \"Now of course we\u0027re not going to signal to the Government exactly how and when we will do that, we are looking at a number of things that we can do.  \"This will be procedural, this will be what we can do around legislation, but we\u0027ll do it on the basis that we\u0027re discharging our duty to stand up for Scotland, but it\u0027ll be done in a way which is dignified, which does show respect, we will not show discourtesy.  \"But it will be absolutely crystal clear that there\u0027s a real determination that we have, and if I may say so as well that our colleagues that we work closely with in the Scottish Government have, that Westminster has to understand that we cannot accept what is taking place.\"  The UK Government has previously said the Bill delivers on its pledge to give \"significant further powers\" to the Scottish Parliament, and it would seek consent unless there are \"not normal circumstances applying\" - describing Brexit as such an exception.  The Scottish Parliament has not granted a legislative consent motion for the key Brexit legislation.  Mr Blackford earlier said the Government has to bring forward emergency legislation which respects devolution, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people.  Asked if the ball was in their court, he said: \"It is, one I think the Government has got to bring forward legislation, two I think they have got to enter into talks through the joint ministerial committee with the Scottish Government but it has to be on that basis that they understand that they\u0027ve crossed the line and this is not acceptable.  \"I think on the basis of where we are at the moment, I do think that David Mundell\u0027s position is untenable.\"  Mr Blackford claimed Brexit Secretary David Davis was \"more appreciative and understanding of the position that we\u0027re taking\", adding: \"I think what the Government in London needs to have is someone that\u0027s a Secretary of State that understands the devolution settlement.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Tweet goes viral as Celtic fans go hoopy for the branding of a New York construction firm","story":"              CELTIC fans have gone hoopy for the branding of a New York construction firm which appears to bear\u0026nbspa resemblance to the club\u0027s badge.

The Labour leader said the Prime Minister had acknowledged the \u0026pound20.5 billion a year boost for the NHS would come from Brexit, economic growth and tax.  Parliament Player\" seamless=\"seamless\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen style=\"width:100%height:100%\" allow=\"encrypted-media autoplay fullscreen\"\u0026gt  He asked at Prime Minister\u0027s Questions: \"There can be no Brexit dividend before 2022, economic growth is the slowest since 2009 - so which taxes are going up?\"  Mrs May said a long-term plan for the NHS had been set out, with money no longer sent to the EU available for the health service.  In response to heckles from Opposition MPs, Mrs May quoted Mr Corbyn saying he would \"use the funds returned after Brexit\" to invest in public services.  Mr Corbyn replied by telling the PM he said the money should be ring-fenced to replace structural funds to regions, agriculture, the fishing industry and research for universities.  He added: \"Can she be straight with people - which taxes are going up and for whom?\"  Mrs May said Chancellor Philip Hammond will set out the full funding package before the spending review.  She claimed there will be one circumstance in which there will be no money returning from the EU, telling MPs: \"That\u0027s if we adopted Labour\u0027s policy of getting a deal at whatever the price.\"  Mr Corbyn said the funding was \"less than is needed just to stand still\" as he asked why anyone would trust the Government with the NHS.  He said: \"The Prime Minister is writing IOUs just to stand still.  \"Until this Government can be straight with people where the money is coming from, why should anyone, anyone anywhere, trust them on the NHS?\"  Mr Corbyn also drew laughter from MPs as he claimed Mrs May\u0027s figures were \"so dodgy they belong on the side of a bus\".  Mrs May hit back, saying Labour\u0027s plan does not \"add up\".  \"He can stand up here all he likes and talk about the Labour Party\u0027s plans for money, but what we know is that the Labour Party\u0027s plans would bankrupt this economy, and the IFS have said Labour would not raise as much money as they claim even in the short run, let alone the long run.  \"In short, their plan absolutely doesn\u0027t add up.  \"Conservatives putting more money into the National Health Service, Labour losing control of the public finances and bankrupting Britain.\"  She said her party had \"consistently put extra money into the National Health Service\" and had announced a plan which gives the NHS \"certainty of funding for the next five years\"."},{"url":null,"title":"Sick MPs may be unable to take part in crunch Brexit vote","story":"              With Theresa May facing a knife-edge Commons vote over Brexit, Labour has accused the Conservatives of refusing to co-operate with a long-standing convention permitting sick MPs to vote.  Under the convention, MPs who are too ill to make their way through the voting lobbies can be \"nodded through\" from an ambulance or car parked in the parliamentary courtyard.  At least one Labour MP and possibly more were understood to be planning to come from hospital to be nodded through for Wednesday\u0027s crucial vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, which could be decided by the narrowest of margins.  A senior Downing Street source said he was not aware of Conservatives refusing to co-operate, but a Labour spokesman confirmed the party\u0027s whips had been told \"nodding through\" would not be available, denouncing the move as \"obviously unacceptable\".  Tory rebels believe they can inflict defeat on the Government as the flagship legislation returns to the Commons after the Lords again backed giving MPs a \"meaningful\" say on the final deal.  The Prime Minister staved off a Tory rebellion on the move last week but faces a bruising battle in the latest round of voting amid claims she failed to implement a compromise that opponents believed they were promised.  Phillip Lee, who resigned as a government minister in order to back a strengthened role for Parliament, acknowledged there had been a concerted effort to win over would-be rebels, including the \"dark arts\" of persuasion in the corridors of power.  But he claimed the rebels may have the strength to defeat the Prime Minister - who he said he still counts as a friend - unless an 11th-hour concession is agreed.  Dr Lee told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \"We were always going to get the normal dark arts of Westminster taking place, fully expected, but my understanding is that the position taken by a number of colleagues is solid, which is why the Government is still in negotiations.\"  Asked if there were enough rebels to defeat the Government, he said: \"Potentially, yes. But... this for me personally is a position of integrity, that I think Parliament deserves to have a proper role in this process, a truly meaningful vote.\"  He rejected some of the claims made about the consequences of a Government defeat which would give Parliament a greater role in the event of a failure to agree a Brexit deal.  \"I cannot follow the argument, in fact I think it\u0027s nonsense, that somehow this makes it harder for the Prime Minister to do a deal in Brussels.\"  He added: \"I continue to be hopeful that the Government will accept our position but fundamentally this is not about the Government, this is about Parliament and - I would argue - this is about my country, this is about securing a Brexit deal which is good for my country in the longer term.  \"I think, in the unlikely event that Government fails to get a deal, Parliament should play a part in trying to find a solution.\"  Dominic Grieve, one of the leading figures in the stand-off, said he expected negotiations to \"go right to the wire\".  The possibility of a rebellion \"all depends on where we go on the negotiations and at the moment I don\u0027t know the answer\", the former attorney general added.  Tory Remainer Anna Soubry posted a lengthy statement about why she will rebel and denied being a \"traitor\".  \"Getting Brexit right is vital and is the most important set of decisions our country has taken in decades,\" she wrote.  \"Whatever we were told during the referendum, you can\u0027t simply unravel 43 years of membership of the EU in a year or two and getting a new trading deal is far from the \u0027simplest\u0027 of matters as we were assured.\"  Peers on Monday backed an amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, tabled by Viscount Hailsham, that would require the Government to allow MPs to vote on how it would proceed in the absence of a Brexit deal by January 21 next year.  MPs will now vote on whether to adopt the motion, which was brought in after pro-EU rebels led by Mr Grieve accused the Government of reneging on measures they believed had been agreed to see off a rebellion last week.  The Prime Minister has warned against any moves to \"tie her hands\" during negotiations with Brussels, saying that Parliament must not be able to \"overturn the will of the British people\".  Under Government plans, if MPs reject the agreement reached by Mrs May with Brussels, or if no deal has been obtained by January 21, Parliament will be offered the opportunity to vote on a \"neutral motion\" stating it has considered a minister\u0027s statement on the issue.  Crucially, the motion will be unamendable, meaning MPs cannot insert a requirement for Mrs May to go back to the negotiating table, extend the Brexit transition or revoke the UK\u0027s withdrawal under Article 50.  The Commons vote comes as Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament\u0027s Brexit co-ordinator, appears before MPs at hearings of the Exiting the EU and Home Affairs select committees."},{"url":null,"title":"Claims food supplements can slow Alzheimer  39 s progress are   39 irresponsible  39 ","story":"              Experts have strongly condemned \"irresponsible\" and \"deeply cynical\" claims that a new food supplement can slow the progress of Alzheimer\u0027s.  A study of 13 patients found that a combination of fish oil and eye-protective nutrients led to \"significant\" improvements in memory, sight and mood.  Trial patients who took the Memory Health supplement \"displayed overwhelmingly positive responses\", according to a press release accompanying the product\u0027s launch.  Progression of the disease was delayed and the supplement helped \"maintain cognitive abilities and quality of life\", it was claimed.  A month\u0027s supply of 30 of the capsules costs \u0026pound27.50 and is available online from www.memoryhealth.  But leading experts strongly criticised the research behind the product, calling the \"breakthrough\" claims irresponsible and warning that the findings were \"highly unlikely to be true\".  Thirteen patients with mild to advanced Alzheimer\u0027s disease were given the supplement for 18 months and their progress assessed.  Each Memory Health capsule contains a combination of macular carotenoids and fish oil containing omega-3 fatty acids.  Macular carotenoids such as lutein and zeaxanthin are plant-derived pigment compounds that are thought to protect the retina from damage.  The new approach to tackling Alzheimer\u0027s was pioneered by Dr Alan Howard, inventor of the low-calorie rapid weight loss plan the Cambridge Diet.  Dr Howard, who chairs The Howard Foundation charity that promotes nutrition research and was one of the study authors, said: \"This represents one of the most important medical advancements of the century.  \"Alzheimer\u0027s disease is the largest public health crisis the UK has ever faced, and drug companies have so far fallen at every hurdle in finding a solution.  \"This study gives us that breakthrough, in a unique natural compound of nutrients.\"  Colleague Professor John Nolan, founder of The Nutrition Research Centre Ireland (NRCI) in Waterford, where the study took place, said: \"I believe this is a valuable discovery that will challenge perceptions worldwide about the role of nutrition in brain function.\"  However, independent experts reviewing the results published in the Journal of Alzheimer\u0027s Disease were not impressed.  Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at the University of Glasgow, said: \"Whilst any research in Alzheimer\u0027s disease is to be welcomed, this is too small a trial and lacks a placebo control so that its findings are highly unlikely to true.  \"In fact I would place no reliance on these results, especially since we know little effect of fish oils or carotenoid supplements on other outcomes in proper trials.\"  Professor Robert Howard, head of Old Age Psychiatry at University College London, said: \"This report is sadly not much more than low-grade anecdotal evidence. Certainly, it falls seriously short of the standards of a high-quality clinical trial in terms of scale and conduct.  \"The accompanying claims made by Dr Howard seem irresponsible and completely unsupported by any reasonable reading of his data.  \"Sadly, people with dementia and their carers will grasp at any straw and I would worry about the impact of media reports around what seem either naive or deeply cynical attempts to exploit this.\"  Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at the charity Alzheimer\u0027s Research UK, said: \"The experimental design of this study makes it hard to draw meaningful conclusions about the effect of these supplements on the symptoms of Alzheimer\u0027s... claims about the significance of these findings should be met with caution.\"  Memory Health is licensed on a not-for-profit basis by the Howard Foundation with \u0026pound1.50 from every purchase supporting research into Alzheimer\u0027s disease."},{"url":null,"title":" Summer of discontent  four-day strike shuts schools in East Dunbartonshire","story":"              All schools and nurseries in East Dunbartonshire are to be shut for four days as part of a\"summer of discontent\" strike plan over terms and conditions cuts including slashing staff holidays.

The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

The Aberdeenshire-based family firm is using the Royal Highland Show (RHS) to gather feedback and competitor analysis on its new milk chocolate recipe as well as comparing its real dairy ice cream with an oil-based major brand product.                                                    It will mark the largest event that the SRUC’s mobile sensory lab - a lorry trailer equipped with state-of-the-art food-testing technology and 12 illuminated taste-testing pods - will have attended to date.        Karin Hayhow, Marketing Director at Mackie’s, said: “This might well sound like an excuse for lots of fun – but we really do need a wide range of people to give us feedback on the taste of our products – that’s the most important attribute – and one that will inform what we go out to market with. “We always try to do something special for the RHS as it’s an integral part of the Mackie’s business, so we’re thrilled to be invited to participate on board the SRUC’s amazing new facility.“Hopefully the participants will enjoy getting a peek into the behind-the-scenes process of testing products before they are released on to the market.”Students at the college will be assisting with the sensory lab throughout the show, featuring a range of produce. SRUC reached out to invite Mackie’s thanks in part to its indelible links with the college.

She was delighted someone wanted to hear her story.Befriending Caithness \u0026ndash part of Caithness Voluntary Group \u0026ndash now has groups in Wick, Thurso, Mey, Berriedale and Bettyhill. Mey is especially popular, with befriendees meeting from across the county every couple of months for soup and sandwiches, where there is a \u0026ldquoconstant buzz of chatter, like music. It\u0026rsquos lovely to hear, Angie said.The intergenerational group involves S5/S6 school pupils visiting hospitals and care homes. One befriendee said these befrienders are \u0026ldquolike young relations.The benefits of this are twofold. As well as keeping the befriendees company, it gets the young befriendees into the voluntary mind-set early on, encourages them to become more empathetic and confident and it shows they can make a difference.Befriendees also benefit from regular contact with people \u0026ldquoso they feel as though they\u0026rsquore part of the community, according to befriending co-ordinator Elspeth Manson.Angie added: \u0026ldquoHelping someone recognise their worth is a benefit for both the befriendee and the volunteer.The recruitment procedure includes volunteers receiving Protecting Vulnerable Groups (PVG) clearance and providing three references. Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm. Tickets cost \u0026pound5 and this will go towards the July summer lunch.As well as being greatly appreciated by co-ordinators, the joy felt by the befriendees is evident. Co-ordinator Isobel Campbell shared a few, including \u0026ldquobefriending has saved my life, \u0026ldquohaving a befriender would be a luxury and \u0026ldquobefriending is a cup of kindness.One volunteer remarked: \u0026ldquoI just love a laugh and the banter.Befriending Caithness is looking for a volunteer marketing/social media intern.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster.

He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

The reception it’s had since its launch late last year has been fantastic, so we’re really excited about bringing it to a much wider audience, and sharing our story.“One of the strengths of Orkney’s approach to marketing food and drink is the fact local businesses present a united front at these major events.

It has recently appeared in the news as plans are made in Westminster for the UK\u0026#8217s departure from the European Union.Mr. Carmichael has said he will use his speech to call on the two sides to work to reach an agreement rather than \u0026#8220continue to squabble.\u0026#8221Speaking ahead of the debate, Mr. Carmichael said: “The Conservatives must accept that any shared framework cannot involve the UK Government simply dictating terms. It must be a shared process with joint buy-in, and the burden of proof is on them to build trust and show how this might work. There is, however, also a burden on the SNP to put aside their political posturing and find a deal that works for Scotland rather than storming off in a huff.“The people of Scotland deserve better than yet another battle over the constitution. They deserve Governments working for them. At the moment, neither the SNP Scottish Government, nor the Conservative UK Government, is delivering that.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
